## About The Project

Topic modelling is a widely used technique in natural language processing that helps to extract latent topics from a large collection of documents. In the context of News Articles, it categorises these documents into various categories of requirement, which is very helpful for organisations to manage their content and for the readers as well, to easily find articles of interest.

It can also help in content summarisation by breaking down the lengthy articles into keywords and themes to briefly summarise the content in a concise manner, without loss of information.

This Project focuses on the former application, to determine the underlying topics within the corpus of News Articles. The original category of each article is provided as an input for evaluation of the topic modeling algorithm. It should be noted that these original categories are not considered as an input for modeling and is in no way influences the algorithm metholody.
