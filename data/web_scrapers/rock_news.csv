Kerrang!;Kerrang! to cycle to Download with Heavy Metal Truants to raise money…;Kerrang!’s own Nick Ruskell will be donning the Lycra and pedalling his wheels of steel to Download, alongside Enter Shikari, metal-loving scientist Matt Taylor and more...;"How are you getting to Download? Car? Classic. Train? Pricey, packed and perpetually unreliable. Helicopter to the airport next door? Only if you've got as much money as Gene Simmons. 
While the rest of the Kerrang! team head up in a minibus, Senior Commissioning Editor and Lord Of Darkness Nick Ruskell will be joining the legendary Heavy Metal Truants in going by bike to raise money for charity. Over three days, he and the HM Truants crew – including organiser and Kerrang! alumnus Alex Milas, Enter Shikari's Rob Rolfe, and Dr. Matt Taylor, the metal-loving scientist who led the team to park the Rosetta probe on that comet that time – will cover almost 200 miles, starting at Alexandra Palace in London, and finishing on the hallowed turf of the festival site just in time for bar opening time on the Friday. 
To sponsor Nick and stop him grumbling for five minutes, visit his event page.""Even though my participation has basically guaranteed a wet festival, it's truly exciting to be joining the Truants this year,"" says our man. ""I love cycling big things like this, and I've always wanted to join them but for one reason or another I was always too busy in the days before Download. It always looks like a laugh, and I'm looking forward to helping them continue raising money for awesome causes.
""It's going to be hard work, but still an infinitely easier way of getting to the festival than the times I've had to round up the rest of the staff after the Kerrang! Awards and drive them up there myself. And the delicious pint our Editor Luke Morton will have waiting for me when I arrive will make the sore legs worth it…""This will be the 10th time HM Truants have travelled to the festival in the saddle, and along with other sponsored cycling events they do, raised almost £5,000,000 for their chosen charities Teenage Cancer Trust, Nordoff Robbins and Childline. Previous participants have included Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, Amon Amarth singer Johann Hegg, and Orange Goblin frontman Ben Ward.

Kerrang!;Waterparks tease fifth album, which is “80 per cent done” — Kerrang!;Waterparks’ fifth album – the follow-up to last year’s Greatest Hits – is very much in progress right now…;"Waterparks have been doing all sorts of teasing lately, and have now confirmed that PARX5 – aka their fifth album – is currently ""80 per cent done"".
Taking to social media, the Texas trio share that they've got a lot of new material to whittle down for their next record, and are currently working with 55 songs that run for a total time of two hours and 23 minutes. (Of course, Awsten Knight had worked on ""a hundred-something songs"" during the pandemic before settling on the 17 that make up 2021 album Greatest Hits, so it's very unlikely that we'll actually get to hear all 55 sadly.)
Over on his Instagram stories, the frontman wrote of this new material, ""Can't even describe how good this shit is,"" and said that song number 54 out of 55 was his ""current fave"". He also tweeted that the band ""need more friends on this album"", with phem and Against The Current's Chrissy Costanza throwing their hats in the ring in the replies.

Kerrang!;Listen: Bush share new single, Heavy Is The Ocean;Ahead of the release of next month’s The Art Of Survival, Bush have unveiled huge album opener Heavy Is The Ocean.;"Bush have shared the opening track from their upcoming album The Art Of Survival.
Entitled Heavy Is The Ocean, the song not only “sets the tone” for the record according to Gavin Rossdale, but also previews “the gravitas” of The Art Of Survival as a whole.
“I love the power of the ocean,” the frontman explains. “It’s mesmerising to me. It feeds your soul. The song uses the imagery I love. At this point, I’m chained at the zoo of rock! So, I was like, ‘Fuck it, I’m going to turn that puppy up.’ This one definitely represents The Art Of Survival.”
Of the album – which is due out on October 7 via BMG – Gavin explains: “Instead of being mournful or self-piteous, this is about the success stories of humanity’s survival against the odds. People just find a way to push through. We’ve all obviously suffered in varying degrees. I think the nature of life is the art of survival. Everyone is being tested all of the time, but we find a way. In recent memory, we’ve made major strides and shown great resilience in the face of war, endless instances of racism, gender politics, a pandemic, and a melting pot of what we’ve experienced. For me, The Art Of Survival encompasses all of this.”

shared an accompanying video featuring him and his ‘younger self’ living it up in Camden.
“I wanted to make something that looked like emo Shameless or St.
Trinian’s on acid,” he explains. “As I was writing the song, I was visualising
the video in my head, it literally helped me get the words down on paper.
“I knew it had to be shot in Camden Town and I wanted to be
walking side by side with my younger self, guiding him through a fucked-up
world based on real memories and people I have encountered in my life. Almost a
message to myself saying that life doesn’t always have to be so deep and there
is beauty to be found in chaos and opportunity in disaster.”
He adds that finding a younger YUNGBLUD in actor Colt was pretty
easy, having met him in New Orleans and “immediately” knowing he wanted him for
the job.
“He was such a little brat with a load of bite and energy and
felt exactly like me when I was his age so we flew him out to London for the
shoot,” he continues. “This video is completely bonkers, but that’s what makes
it perfect.”";2023-08-04;https://www.kerrang.com/i-wanted-it-to-look-like-emo-shameless-or-st-trinians-on-acid-yungblud-releases-lowlife-video;2023-08-06;9999-12-31;1;KERRANG!“IWANTEDITTOLOOKLIKEEMOSHAMELESSORST.TRINIAN’SONACID”:…

Kerrang!;Watch: SpiritWorld share Relic Of Damnation, the conclusion to their…;SpiritWorld have unleashed new single Relic Of Damnation, along with a cinematic video that brings their DeathWestern trilogy to an end…;"Ahead of their new album Deathwestern next month, SpiritWorld
have unleashed the mighty Relic Of Damnation.
The cinematic conclusion to their video trilogy (and released
just in time for Halloween), band leader Stu Folsom says of Relic…: “The video
is the finale of our DeathWestern trilogy with director Todd Hailstone. Being
able to work with my longtime friend, going all the way back to being high
school punk rockers, has been incredible. 
“He took my vision of gun smoke, gore and heavy metal and worked
up three incredible videos. It was probably a little ambitious to do a film
trilogy that spreads across two albums, but I think the performances Todd got
from Derek and Voki to finish this bad boy off were amazing!”
Meanwhile, of the actual single itself, Stu shares: “Relic Of
Damnation has been my favourite riff on the record but was the biggest m’fer to
finish. I knew I had a classic that brings back that Metallica, Slayer vibe I
love so much, but I never liked the vocals and tried out three or four
different rewrites after the demo. The very last night we worked on it,
Theresa, Matt and I were fried and about to call it a night when I repurposed a
verse from a country song I was writing and put it over the first verse. The
vocals were done in one take and is my favourite vocal delivery on the album. I
also love the vocals that trade off at the end between Justin Fornof and I. Relic
is a banger and has been a staple of our live set since our first show! I’m so
excited for people to finally have the studio recording!”

Kerrang!;Norma Jean announce new album Deathrattle Sing For Me;As well as announcing details of their ninth album Deathrattle Sing For Me, Norma Jean have unleashed “dangerous rock’n’roll” single Call For The Blood…;"Would you believe it, Norma Jean are back! As well as a new single Call For The Blood, the American metalcore band have unveiled details of their ninth album Deathrattle Sing For Me.
Charging into a new era, the outfit have pulled together an album that is a “rallying cry”, as lead vocalist Cory Brandan labels it. 
Speaking on the newly-released single, the frontman explains: “Composed by my brother, [co-producer] Matthew [Putman], this song was written around a single idea, altered heavily in post, and then mimicked by us. The studio and post-production elements acted as an instrument. 
“The experimentation and the process behind this track was a major point of inspiration for many other things we ended up doing throughout Death Rattle Sing For Me. I feel like Matthew wrote this song with my voice in mind and I wanted to do something very unique over it. Dangerous rock'n'roll! Blast it!""
""CFTB was one of the first songs where I felt like we were establishing a personality for the album,"" continues Matthew. ""Even though it was constructed in the studio from manipulated ideas we captured during a 'riff vomiting' session with Grayson, it still has a very raw, live energy.
“The samples were all chosen in a very deliberate way for how they coloured the story behind the song (rebellious unity). There is nothing random about CFTB; every sound has meaning. This is one of my all-time favourite vocal performance from Cory, where he proves once again why he's one of the best of his generation.""

Fresh from announcing a massive support slot on Slipknot's upcoming Knotfest Roadshow tour later this year, the hip-hop crossover legends have also just shared details of their 10th album.
The new record – the follow-up to 2018's Elephants On Acid – will be called Back In Black, and is due out on March 18 via BMG. “This album is a return to our roots,” says Sen Dog. “We were proud hip-hoppers back in the day and we’ve gone through it all. We’re proud to be part of the hip-hop industry. Doing a straight hip-hop joint was the way to go.”
To coincide with the news, the band have shared new single Bye Bye, featuring rising rapper Dizzy Wright.
Says B-Real of the track: “I think with this song, it’s a statement where – in a roundabout way – we speak to the politics of today. That we’re being lulled into this dreamworld. To try to blind us from the separation that the politicians and government create. Trying to put us to sleep and while we’re in this sleep state of unawareness they do whatever they want.”

has just arrived.
The pop superstar – who will seemingly play Harley Quinn but that’s
not confirmed just yet – has shared a brand-new image of her in
character alongside Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck.
The photo was appropriately shared on Valentine’s Day, though it’s
hard to tell just yet if this scene featuring Gaga and Joker is actually
romantic, given that there seems to be some smudged make-up on both of their
faces, and an intriguing look in their eyes…
Amusingly, Fall Out Boy also got in on the social media action
following the picture’s unveiling, given that Joker 2’s title is the same as
their fourth album Folie À Deux. “Let’s hear it for America’s
suitehearts,” they wrote as the caption, referencing second single America’s
Suitehearts.
Joker: Folie À Deux is scheduled to hit cinemas on October 4,

Due out on October 21 via Music For Nations, the LP was produced by Pigs x7’s Sam Grant at Blank Studios in Newcastle, and, as vocalist Amy Walpole says, is “a step above what we’ve done before as we had a chance to experiment with sound and structure. It was our first opportunity to explore writing a body of work which was challenging but has been so rewarding!”
Amy adds: “It pushed our creative process because we also had to think about the songs sitting side by side on an album! We tried to break out of what makes a typical Witch Fever song whilst still being true to what makes our sound what it is.”
To coincide with the announcement, the band have shared the title-track and official video, with Amy explaining, “This is Alisha [Yarwood, guitar]’s personal fave! It marks a new step in our development as songwriters as it’s something different from what we’ve done before. We allowed ourselves to experiment with space and dynamics and we love it!”

enthuses Ali Richardson. “As the touring schedule started to fill up, we truly
began to appreciate the effect the album was having on our career so we put
this idea in motion of releasing a deluxe edition for our fans. 
“The three new songs that can be found here were very nearly a
part of the initial release. They’re all very different in their composition
and many arguments were had whilst settling on our final tracklisting. The Will
To Resist takes the lead single here as a band favourite. I’m sure its
intensity will resonate with our audience. You can visit our website to

Warner Bros. Pictures’ latest three-minute teaser features the whole gang in action, bracing for a huge battle with Grindelwald, as Dumbledore (Jude Law), Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and more face up to the evil wizard.
""Professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) knows the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen) is moving to seize control of the wizarding world,"" reads the synopsis. ""Unable to stop him alone, he entrusts Magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) to lead an intrepid team of wizards, witches and one brave Muggle baker on a dangerous mission, where they encounter old and new beasts and clash with Grindelwald’s growing legion of followers. But with the stakes so high, how long can Dumbledore remain on the sidelines?""

A statement reveals that their upcoming U.S. and Australia tour dates will be their “final live shows”, and they apologise to the places “we will not be able to visit [one] last time”.
Read the full statement below:
“Our upcoming North American and Australian tours will be our final live shows.
“It’s hard to believe it’s been over a decade since we played our first gig in Sydney. Back then all we could think about was writing and recording an EP so we could start playing local shows. In the ten years since we’ve been fortunate enough to write and release three records and perform our songs at hundreds and hundreds of shows, across so many countries that we’ve lost count. It’s so much more than we could have ever hoped to achieve.
“This was all possible only through the love and support our music found. So thank you for listening. Thank you for coming to the shows. Thank you for everything. To those in places we will not be able to visit a last time we apologise. To those we will see, we look forward to playing these songs one last time with you.”Read this: The story of pop-punk in 16 songs";2022-09-12;https://www.kerrang.com/with-confidence-announce-final-live-shows-thank-you-for-everything;2022-09-14;9999-12-31;1;KERRANG!WITHCONFIDENCEANNOUNCEFINALLIVESHOWS:“THANKYOUFOREVERYTHING”

The band are giving fans the chance to hear the first single Records – from what is presumably off the Summer EP – before it’s released next week, but they’re using an app called the Human Record Player, created by Brian Moore, in order to listen.
Basically, you have to physically get involved with this interactive experience, by scanning and launching the app, and then spinning yourself round (clockwise, obvs – though you can try the other way if you want…). The song will then play for as long as you spin. If you’re able to manage the full runtime of 3:28 then quite frankly you deserve a medal…

Speaking about their mindset going into the record, frontman Matt Tuck previously enthused: “I wanted to come out guns blazing, fucking middle fingers flying and just go for the throat. I think this is a far more aggressive, intense part of Bullet For My Valentine. It’s always been there, I’ve just never opened the floodgates on it.

The Prince Of Darkness unleashed his new record’s title-track along with classic single Crazy Train for the performance, which also saw him joined onstage by Zakk Wylde and Tommy Clufetos, plus Jane’s Addiction’s Chris Chaney and producer Andrew Watt.
Ozzy is on the cover of Kerrang! this week, and he spoke to us all about his desire and focus to properly get back out on tour one last time.
“I am going to put 110 per cent into getting myself out there,” he said of his planned farewell shows. “Time is my most valuable asset now. I’m 73. I don’t think that I’ll be here in another 25 years. I’ve got a goal: the goal is to get back onstage. I had my last surgery in June, I can’t have any more. So whatever I make of it is entirely up to me now. Even if I manage one show, then fall over, [I’ll have done it]. But I know that I’m going to carry on. I know I can beat it. I know that I can get back onstage. It’s just that I’ve got to get off my butt and go for it.”

Speaking to Kerrang! last year about the band’s reunion and how it came about, Glenn Danzig explained, “What I will say is that eventually Jerry [Only, Misfits bassist] and I worked out a bunch of our differences and we decided that if we were going to do a reunion, we were going to do it now rather than later, while we’re still young and vital and can still go crazy and run around a stage.”
When asked about a potential new Misfits album, the frontman revealed, “I’m taking it one day at a time, so we‘ll see where all this leads. If it ends up somewhere like that, then great.

Kerrang!;Deaf Havana share sentimental new single, Kids — Kerrang!;Watch the new video for Kids, the latest single from Deaf Havana’s upcoming sixth album The Present Is A Foreign Land.;"Deaf Havana have shared a wonderful, sentimental new single, Kids.
“Kids, like many songs of ours, is a retrospective romance with our younger years,” explains James Veck-Gilodi. “It views growing up in boring coastal towns through rose tinted glasses and asks a lot of questions as to what the people we grew up with are doing now. It's mainly a nostalgic song about small English towns, about what could've been and what is.”
The single is taken from Deaf Havana's upcoming sixth album The Present Is A Foreign Land, which is due out on July 15. Speaking to Kerrang! recently about their hopes for the record following a line-up change and period of uncertainty, James enthused, “I hope people love it, and I hope it connects with them. This is the first time I've really, really wanted to be in this band, which sounds mental because I'm 31 and it's a lot of albums down the line… but I just hope that people keep listening and keep coming to shows so we can continue to do this.”
“Yeah, I really hope people take to it massively,” Matty added. “But because of how it came about, the record has already fulfilled its purpose for us. We made it for us, so anything that comes now is a bit of a bonus. Whether it flops or not doesn't matter to me.”
Watch the video for Kids below:The Present Is A Foreign Land is due out on July 15. Before that, Deaf Havana will play the Royal Albert Hall with Don Broco in March, and Slam Dunk Festival on June 3 – 4.

Kerrang!;Simple Plan launch Ukraine fundraiser with new video, Wake Me Up…;Simple Plan are raising money for UNICEF with the video for their latest single, Wake Me Up (When This Nightmare’s Over).;"Simple Plan have shared the video for new single Wake Me Up (When This Nightmare's Over), helping to raise money for those affected by the war in Ukraine.
Directed by Ukrainian filmmaker Jensen Noen and filmed with a Ukrainian cast and crew, the video was created after the pop-punks saw what was going on and decided that they needed to do something to help.
""When we saw the first images from the war in Ukraine, we felt so heartbroken and powerless. The impact on young children and families felt especially devastating and made us want to do something to help,"" they explain. ""The idea to do this video was sparked by discussions with our good friend and director Jensen Noen. We could feel just how important and personal the events in Ukraine were for him and from there, the concept for the video emerged.""
Jensen himself says, ""Since the war started, I've gone through a range of emotions. From depression to rage, to an overwhelming sense of helplessness. I can't describe what it's been like to watch my home country being torn to shreds. Its people being raped and killed, innocent children and civilians dying every day. Many of my family and friends have already been affected by the war. I'm so grateful to Simple Plan for giving me an opportunity to tell the story of what's going on in my country.
""To be able to help raise awareness and money for this cause means the world to me. It feels so good to be doing something instead of just sitting around feeling helpless. To use my art to help tell the story of my people. And the fact that I got to work with a mainly Ukrainian cast and crew, made this whole experience even more special. I'm grateful to Simple Plan and all of our incredible cast and crew that donated their time to this cause.""

Kerrang!;Listen to Crawlers’ anthemic new single I Don’t Want It;Crawlers have shared a vital new single, I Don’t Want It, which “encompasses what it is like to be growing up in the current state of society and how it has affected the mental health of the modern generation”.;"Following 2022 singles I Can’t Drive and Fuck Me (I Didn’t Know How To Say), Crawlers have just unveiled another brilliant new track.
Says vocalist Holly Minto of the anthemic new banger: “I Don’t Want It encompasses what it is like to be growing up in the current state of society and how it has affected the mental health of the modern generation from a first and third perspective. I have a lot of unhealthy habits that I am very self-aware of, however they don’t seem to change and seem to manifest into worse problems which I try to ignore, this isn’t really my own issue either, so many of us are aware of our own self-destructive behaviours but we ignore them for the sake of it being easier than recovery. 
“I think the song actually took fruition when my therapist said, ‘You’re very self-aware, aren’t you?’ It’s very much a curse that we all, especially gen Z share. Maybe because self-deprecation has become such a normalised thing, which I hate but I can’t help but feed into. Writing it was a good way of me getting out a lot of behaviours I want to change about myself as well as critiquing other behaviours that society tends to normalise while growing up in your teens and early 20s. 
“As soon as Amy [Woodall] sent me the riff I instantly knew I wanted to get these particular feelings out and create a song with the guys that sounds like the music I am listening to, especially when I am engaging in the behaviours mentioned in the lyrics, which has always been indie with a killer riff and a fat hook – kinda full circle in a way.”

Kerrang!;Mothica drops powerful new single Casualty: “I didn’t want to let these inherited destructive diseases control me anymore” — Kerrang!;Mothica has shared a brand-new single, Casualty, that is as impactful as it is catchy.;"Alt. star Mothica has shared a powerful new single, Casualty.
Released via Heavy Heart Records – her imprint with Rise Records and BMG – the single tackles some personal and important subject matter, with Mothica wanting to address them head-on.
“On the way to the studio, I was thinking about how many things in my life were set up to destroy me,” she explains. “Like, alcoholism and depression that runs in my family. I suffer from both, and I really hate the idea of either of these things being the reason I give up on life. The word 'casualty' refers more to the numbers to represent how fatal a war is, and doesn’t really consider the individuality of each life lost. 
“With over two years sober, this song was an empowered response, that I didn’t want to let these inherited destructive diseases control me anymore. A promise to not die by suicide or drug overdose, which was a very real trajectory for me in the past. It’s one of those songs that just sets my soul on fire in the best way.”

have announced details of their upcoming 16th album.
Entitled Hard Cold Fire, the record
is due out on May 5 via Marshall, and hears the trio essentially make the opposite
of a lockdown album. “When we began to rehearse the
songs, we realised there was an empathetic quality to them,” explains vocalist
and guitarist Andy Cairns. “We wanted to make something that was a bit more
relatable, and less standoffish and claustrophobic – which we have a history
of, and it stands in places – but we wanted to make something more approachable
and open.”
Adds bassist Michael McKeegan: “We
wanted this album to be one that felt good to play live, almost a release after
this period of stasis, but then also not dwelling on the whole situation
– we’re moving forward, and we wanted that energy to be there.”

They also explain that the incident happened out of view from the stage, otherwise they would have “stopped the show until the situation was under control”. Nevertheless, their security team and venue staff were able to “restrain and remove” the man.
Read the full statement below:
“After last night’s show in SLC, we were made aware of an incident that happened in the crowd while we were on stage. A man physically and verbally assaulted multiple women, including an engaged couple at our show. Our security team and venue staff were made aware and were able to restrain and remove him.
“We did not realize this was happening, as the incident took place out of view from stage. Had we seen any of this happening, we would have stopped the show until the situation was under control.
“PARAMORE DOES NOT CONDONE violence, homophobia, or bigotry of any kind. It is supremely unwelcome in our community and has no place at our shows.
“To the fans who were hurt by or who witnessed what happened last night, we are so sorry. We hope that you know we will always do anything we can to protect you and make you feel celebrated.
“To make things as clear as possible: Paramore shows are meant to be a safe place for people. If you can’t respect that, do not come.”Read this: The first reaction to Paramore’s new single, This Is Why";2022-10-06;https://www.kerrang.com/paramore-condemn-violence-homophobia-or-bigotry-of-any-kind-following-apparent-assault-at-utah-show;2022-10-09;9999-12-31;1;KERRANG!PARAMORECONDEMN“VIOLENCE,HOMOPHOBIAORBIGOTRYOFANYKIND”…
Kerrang!;Sophie Powers unveils empowering new single U Love It — Kerrang!;Sophie Powers and $atori Zoom drop massive new track U Love It – a song that proves “you can feel pretty and desirable while feeling dominant and powerful”.;"Young hyperpop-punk star Sophie Powers has shared a brand-new single, U Love It, featuring alternative rapper $atori Zoom.
“The song title U Love It alludes to the feminine power that the song itself carries,” she explains. “My intentions while writing this song were to prove that you can feel pretty and desirable while feeling dominant and powerful. Even with all of the amazing change happening right now, it still feels like there's a lot of stigma surrounding the idea that to feel 'feminine' you cannot be strong and independent-minded. 
“In the song, both lyrically and performance-wise, I try to embody Megan Fox’s character and persona in Jennifer’s Body: a girl-eater who is confident and beautiful. Not saying I'm confident 24/7, but when I do feel good or want to feel better about myself, this song would be the first one I would play. It's for the girls, gays, non-binary folk, and anyone and everyone in between who needs to be reminded of their power, and who they are!”
U Love It is taken from Sophie's upcoming debut EP, Red In Revenge. Check it out below:Catch Sophie Powers supporting NOAHFINNCE at the following dates later this year:

Kerrang!;Meet Me @ The Altar will release their debut album this year — Kerrang!;Meet Me @ The Altar have confirmed that their debut full-length – following last year’s Model Citizen EP – will arrive in 2022.;"Exciting news! Following a huuuuuge 2021 with the release of their awesome Model Citizen EP and first-ever Kerrang! cover, Meet Me @ The Altar will be releasing their debut album this year.
Though the trio haven't given very much away just yet, they've taken to Twitter to share that: ""American pop-punk band Meet Me @ The Altar will release their debut full-length album in 2022.""
And while last year they already played an important role in not just the recent pop-punk revival but also paving the way for its exciting future, surely with a debut LP behind them things will only go further from here on out.
""The end goal is to inspire a whole new wave of bands that wouldn’t necessarily have had the confidence to assert themselves in a predominantly white, male scene,"" guitarist Téa Campbell told us last summer. ""We’re rare in our mentality, because we just didn’t care [about the limitations of the scene] – we were just going to do it. But not everyone is like that, so it’s cool that we’re going to be able to give others that courage.""
Vocalist Edith Johnson, meanwhile, shared of what constitutes success for MM@TA: ""The best compliment you could give us would be: ‘Wow, these girls can really write.’ Halsey was talking to us about how as artists of colour in this particular space, it’s always going to be a topic of conversation that we’re women, and that we’re women of colour as well, and sometimes that’s going to overshadow the fact that first and foremost we’re artists.
""We, as women of colour in an alt.rock band, [wrote their Model Citizen EP] all by ourselves, with no co-writers or anything, which is our first big release on a major label. I want people to hear us and say we’re talented... because we are!""

Kerrang!;Kerrang! partner with Music Venue Trust for Conjurer headline tour;Kerrang! has partnered with the Music Venue Trust for a very special, intimate Conjurer tour in September.;"Conjurer have announced a six-date tour of the UK, presented by Kerrang! and the Music Venue Trust.
As part of MVT's United By Music Tour, the midlands metallers will play a string of grassroots, independent venues this September – kicking off in the Met Lounge in Peterborough and climaxing at the Hairy Dog in Derby. Support on all dates comes from Unpeople.
Speaking about the tour, Brady Deeprose says, “Conjurer simply would not exist without the UK’s extensive network of grassroots music venues. We cut our teeth playing everywhere from Merthyr Tydfil to Barrow-In-Furness for years, and we were lucky to be able to do so. The threat that GMVs are under is an utter travesty, and something that we are so thankful to MVT for getting involved in – without this network, everyone from fans to bands suffers. Throughout my childhood, I would go to The Roadmender in Northampton, The Vault in Rugby (RIP), The Flapper in Birmingham, and Corporation in Sheffield to both play shows and see my favourite bands – that thriving scene inspired me to pick up a guitar and start a band. If we don’t protect it, we lose the next generation of musicians. It’s that simple.” ""To come full circle, Kerrang! putting us forward for this tour is a real privilege, their support for not just us but the UK heavy scene in general, has been untouchable over the last few years. We hope that MVT continues to have success, and that the UK can continue to foster exceptional talent with a strong roster of grassroots venues to support it.”
Kerrang! Editor Luke Morton adds, “The UK heavy music scene is thriving right now, thanks in large part to the community and support of grassroots venues up and down the country. I’m so excited and proud for Kerrang! to partner with the Music Venue Trust for this very metal incarnation of the United By Music Tour, featuring the mighty Conjurer – a band I’ve seen cause absolute chaos in some of our best independent venues over the years. As fans of rock, metal and alternative music, it's vital we all champion the homegrown, grassroots venues that are the lifeblood of our scene. Support your local venue and make sure you catch Conjurer tearing it to shreds!”
Tickets for the Conjurer tour go on sale Friday at 11am. And every ticket buyer can take a guest with them for free by showing a National Lottery ticket.

Kerrang!;Sugar Horse announce EP featuring members of Heriot, IDLES, Conjurer…;Listen to Sugar Horse’s new single Disco Loadout (featuring Heriot’s Debbie Gough and more), from their upcoming Waterloo Teeth collaborative EP.;"Following last year’s debut The Live Long After, Bristol’s Sugar Horse have announced details of a new collaborative EP, Waterloo Teeth.
The band join forces with everyone from Heriot’s Debbie Gough to Pupil Slicer’s Kate Davies to IDLES’ Adam Devonshire to Oceansize / Biffy Clyro’s Mike Vennart for the four-track release, which is due out on October 28 via Small Pond.
Up first they’ve previewed the EP with the song Disco Loadout, featuring Deb plus St Pierre Snake Invasion / Mclusky’s Damien Sayell and MXLX’s Matt Loveridge.
“This song is more of a comedic idea, than it is actual music,” they say. “This song is all about rhythm, so the guitar and bass parts are either playing all open strings at once, or muting every string at once. On top of that all strings were tuned to entirely random notes, so it’s just complete dissonance. The title comes from playing a show just before a club-night is about to begin and how quickly you have to remove all your gear from the stage.”
Adds Deb: “Sugar Horse are a band I’ve always enjoyed going to watch after having first played with them in 2017! I’m very honoured to be on their track Disco Loudout from this EP and it’s fantastic to see lots of other friends on the tracklist too!”

Featuring full-clean vocals from Serena Cherry and a violin performance from guirarist Liam Phelan, it's something a little bit different from the Bristolian metallers.
""This song is about the exquisite pain and sorrowful beauty of unrequited love,"" says Serena. ""I think it's the saddest, most heartbreaking song we've ever written. Lyrically, the starting point of the verse is about concealment of adoration, before the chorus gives way to realising and accepting a fate of loving someone quietly from afar.
""I cannot watch the music video for How To Swim Down without crying,"" she continues, adding that video creator Boy Tillkens ""has captured the bittersweet emotion of the song so delicately, it's an incredibly moving piece of animation to watch. 
 
""Musically, How To Swim Down saw us dive into uncharted waters with Liam adding many layers of mournful violin parts onto the track. Finally, violins – for the first time in Svalbard history! It feels so exciting to have new instruments on a song. Another first is that How To Swim Down features only clean vocals, no screams. I wanted the vocal delivery of these lyrics to feel as though I'm whispering a secret to someone whilst they're sleeping. My vocals here represent that lonely type of communication, singing to yourself in an empty house. It's a private, selfless love song, where only the listener knows of my heartache.""Svalbard's new album The Weight Of The Mask is released October 6 via Nuclear Blast.

Kerrang!;Disney+ and Hulu confirm Danny Boyle-directed Sex Pistols series…;Based on Steve Jones’ 2017 memoir Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol, new six-episode series Pistol will debut on Disney+ and Hulu in May.;"New Danny Boyle-directed Sex Pistols series Pistol officially has a premiere date!
The six-episode show will arrive in full on May 31, hitting Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ in UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. It's also 'coming soon' to Star+ in Latin America, and Disney+ in all other territories.
A description of Pistol – which is based on Steve Jones’ 2017 memoir Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol – says that it's all 'about a rock'n'roll revolution'.
'The furious, raging storm at the centre of this revolution are the Sex Pistols – and at the centre of this series is Sex Pistols’ founding member and guitarist, Steve Jones,' continues the synopsis. 'Jones’ hilarious, emotional and at times heart-breaking journey guides us through a kaleidoscopic telling of three of the most epic, chaotic and mucus-spattered years in the history of music. Based on Jones’ memoir Lonely Boy: Tales from a Sex Pistol, this is the story of a band of spotty, noisy, working-class kids with 'no future', who shook the boring, corrupt Establishment to its core, threatened to bring down the government and changed music and culture forever.'
Pistol stars Toby Wallace as Steve Jones, Jacob Slater as Paul Cook, Anson Boon as John Lydon, Christian Lees as Glen Matlock and Louis Partridge as Sid Vicious, plus Sydney Chandler as Chrissie Hynde, Talulah Riley as Vivienne Westwood, Maisie Williams as punk icon Jordan, Emma Appleton as Nancy Spungen and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Malcolm McLaren.

Kerrang!;The Wonder Years celebrate 10 years of The Greatest Generation with…;The Wonder Years are celebrating a decade of their phenomenal fourth album The Greatest Generation with a limited-edition anniversary box set, and the release of brilliant bonus track GODDAMNITALL.;"While we’re still very much spinning last year’s excellent The Hum Goes On Forever record, The Wonder Years are throwing things back to 2013.
Specifically, the Philly pop-punk titans are celebrating a whole decade of their phenomenal fourth album The Greatest Generation, which is getting the limited-edition box set treatment featuring rare demos and voice memos, and a 32-page booklet of essays, photos and more.
It also contains ‘new’ tune GODDAMNITALL, which is part-TGG and part-recently finished, and has been unveiled today with a video featuring some awesome footage from the time of The Greatest Generation’s release.
Says vocalist Dan Campbell: “GODDAMNITALL is a song that almost was, and then, for a long time, categorically was not, and now is.
“When it came time to find bonus content for this box set, we went grave digging in old hard-drives to find the demos from TGG that didn’t get finished and then exhumed and reanimated this one. It was the closest to being done at the time. All of the music was there. The chorus had lyrics and melody but, for budget and time constraints it got abandoned before it had verses and a bridge. 
“Now, a decade later, it’s finally finished. We asked Steve Evetts to produce it the same way he would have if it were on the original album and it now stands as a spiritual and somewhat literal B-side to The Greatest Generation.”

long-awaited new album out on the road throughout North America in the autumn with
Falling In Reverse, kicking off in Florida on September 16 and wrapping up in
Texas just under a month later.
And as well as their Deathbats Club platform, A7X will be using their new
TicketPass system in which they plan to reward fans in the long run.
“TicketPass will by no means cost anyone any money, you won't

things that people feel uncomfortable with, and the token that we’re going to
be using is on the Polygon network — an environmentally-friendly blockchain,”
explains frontman M. Shadows. “We want to roll something out to the rest of our
fanbase without them having to opt into a full fan club experience that is
strictly for tickets and ensuring our fans get the best tickets they desire
first.
“At the end of the day, we want to know your feedback on if this
worked well for you, and we will take notes and mold this for you. Look at this
as a frequent flier miles type of program – with Avenged Sevenfold, we will be
breaking these passes into ‘tiers’ over time and rewarding the people who have
been participating the most in our A7X ecosystem (with merchandise, listening
habits, music consumption, live events, and other metrics).”Here are their new tour dates:

A mixture of expressing both sadness and anger in the song, the musician reflects on a toxic relationship in her lyrics. She shares: “I wrote hot girls in hell about someone who really hurt my feelings. I wrote the first half when I was really sad, and the second half when I was really mad. Ending a relationship with someone is tricky – one second you miss them, feeling miserable and pathetic, and the next you are picturing them burning in hell. 
“I really wanted this song to feel like two completely different moods for that reason. The person I wrote this about is definitely going to hell, so here’s hoping there’s no hot girls there for him to f**k.”

“It looks back at my relationship with love and sex with a storytelling perspective, exploring the lengths you’ll go to when you’re conditioned from such a young age not to understand what love is,” Jazmin explains. “Unlike my older songwriting, this track juxtaposes sound, production and lyrics.

With the help of writer Jim Krueger and artist Amilcar Pinna, the band will be telling the story of Eva, who is 'a brilliant painter on the verge of unbelievable acclaim and success', according to a description. It continues: 'But her inability to reconcile her public perception with her true self allows a Spiritbox – a device used to communicate with the dead to transport her to an ethereal world. Here, she finds herself trapped in a realm where false shadows become real and dangerous.'
""I am in love with this story and artwork,"" enthuses vocalist Courtney LaPlante. ""I cannot wait for you to discover Eva and the world that she has been thrust into. It truly is an extension of my feelings and the state of mind I held while writing our album, Eternal Blue, and the lyrics that resonate with me still. Although we are very different, I can’t help but let a lot of myself seep into Eva’s personality and experiences. I care about her so much. Jim and Amilcar are brilliant and we are so happy to share this with you after keeping it to ourselves for so long.""

Kerrang!;Ho99o9 announce new album SKIN, drop opener NUGE SNIGHT — Kerrang!;Ho99o9 have announced details of their second album SKIN, produced by Travis Barker and featuring collabs with Corey Taylor and more.;"After kicking off their next chapter last month with the release of BATTERY NOT INCLUDED, Ho99o9 have just announced details of their highly-anticipated second album SKIN.
Produced by Travis Barker and featuring appearances by Corey Taylor, Bun B, Saul Williams and Jasiah, the duo's second LP will be released on March 11 via DTA Records, and was previously described by Yeti Bones as ""monumental"".
“I might be taking a long shot with this,” he told Kerrang!, “but this is just something that hasn’t been done before. I think it’s just going to be monumental. It’s just always forward-thinking, staying 10 steps ahead of the game musically and mentally with what we’re doing and how we do it and how we put everything out on the table. This album has to stand the test of time.”
“Travis Barker is known for the pop-punk aesthetic with most of the artists that he’s worked with,” added theOGM in the same interview, “and I like that we were able to do something different with him and challenge that. I know [there will be people] who hear that Ho99o9 are putting out an album with Travis Barker, and probably be like, ’Ah man, I don’t know. They probably sold out…’ But when you hear it, you’re like, ‘Oh shit, it’s still Ho99o9! This is fire!’ There’s going to be people that love it and there’s going to be people that don’t fuck with it. Fuck ’em. Who cares? That’s what comes with putting your art out there. Anything that you do, that comes with it. But this shit gonna hit. I’m telling you right now, I don’t have no doubts.”

The song is taken from the band's just-announced Heart Eater EP, which is due out on June 10 via Epitaph and was recorded in a “whirlwind week” in Los Angeles with producers Matt Malpass, Andrew Wade and Andy Karpovck.
Speaking about Feel Something, guitarist Tristan Torres explains that the inspiration “is about wanting to live in the moment and the desire to be present. The recording process was super fast. Fred came up with the chorus and we finished the instrumental and verses together in a couple of hours. We got lucky enough to make friends with Derek from Mayday Parade and he hopped on the track. The music video was insane – we asked some of our fans (family) to come out and dress as our Character Baku. We had so much fun jumping around and hanging out with everyone.”

“We began working on songs right before COVID hit, so we spent those years just
messing around with ideas, riffs, and arrangements. The creation of this record
was a bit of a process, but it gave us an escape from everything else going on
in the world. 
“To this day, I am still trying to wrap my head around this
record,” Jeff continues. “It’s heavy, chaotic, mellow, beautiful and dark. It’s
more of an art piece than your normal standard songs, and that’s exactly what
we wanted. I love hearing it in its entirety and am looking forward to
performing all of the songs. It’s even more of a journey when you hear it live.”

Kerrang!;Watch Will Ramos’ one-take performance of old Lorna Shore song…;Will Ramos has shown off his unbelievable vocals with a one-take vocal performance of Immortal – a song recorded by the band before he joined.;"Having wrapped up a huge year of touring and releasing their 4/5-rated album Pain Remains, Lorna Shore’s Will Ramos has kicked off 2023 by using the band’s current downtime to keep his vocal chops in order.
With Will “finally done with touring for the next few months”, the frontman says that he is putting his focus on “some new vocal content” and his Patreon right now, starting with a performance of Immortal (a song Will has had “a lot of requests” from fans for, given it was originally released in 2020 before he joined the band).
“This is a one take performance, there are no doubles, no layers, no edits,” he explains. “What you see here is exactly what you get live! Enjoy!”

Kerrang!;Disney+ have slightly pushed back the Obi-Wan Kenobi release date;The Obi-Wan Kenobi premiere date has been moved a couple of days, but Disney+ are making up for it with the promise of the first two episodes debuting together!;"Disney+ have announced that the premiere date for the highly-anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi series has been pushed back.
The show will now debut on Friday, May 27 instead of Wednesday, May 25 – but to make up for that little two-day delay, Disney+ will be airing the first two episodes together, instead of just the first.
Announcing the news via Disney's socials, Obi-Wan himself Ewan McGregor said in a video, ""Thank you for all your incredible support and response to Obi Wan-Kenobi… Our premiere date is moving just a couple of days, from Wednesday to Friday, May 27.""
But then he added the ""exciting part"", which is that Star Wars fans will get the first two episodes (out of the full six) in one go, which is a pretty good compromise, eh?!
The synopsis for Obi-Wan Kenobi reads: ""The story begins 10 years after the dramatic events of Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith where Obi-Wan Kenobi faced his greatest defeat – the downfall and corruption of his best friend and Jedi apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, who turned to the dark side as evil Sith Lord Darth Vader.""

Entitled such.a.shame (smoking lounge redux), the stunning new rendition is taken from the band’s upcoming deluxe edition of Rouge Carpet Disaster, which is due out in full on September 15 via Roadrunner Records.
It’s been a busy time for the post-hardcore stars, announcing a support slot with Bring Me The Horizon for 2024 following performances at Slam Dunk and Download. At the latter, we said of their Opus Stage set: “Once the Leeds quartet find their footing, they cook up a storm with a caustic rendition of Push rope and conjure a feeling of apocalyptic heaviness with Courtney, just relax, inciting ever-expanding mosh-pits and compelling the crowdsurfers to barrel over to the front.” K! also concluded that, “Static Dress are metamorphosing from a good live band to a great live band.” So if you’ve got the chance to see them, do not pass it up.

Explaining the inspiration behind the track, De’Wayne shares that it's about, “Not wanting to go out the way I’ve seen my heroes time after time. Being found without love or in the end feeling like they didn’t live up to the pressures you feel as a human. The inspiration comes from driving 1,300 miles from home to a place and leaving there with way more than you had at the beginning.”
He continues that, “I honestly feel we become so obsessed with pleasing and fitting in that you lose who you were when you started and I genuinely don’t wanna exist as an artist that way. So I was expressing, 'I wanna go out with a smile if I can, and not be all messed up by what life does.'”

Kerrang!;Dave Grohl joins Paul McCartney at Glastonbury for first performance…;Paul McCartney brought out very special guest Dave Grohl – for his first public appearance since the death of Taylor Hawkins – at this weekend’s Glastonbury headline slot.;"For his Glastonbury headline performance on Saturday night (June 25), Paul McCartney brought out two incredibly special guests during the set: Bruce Springsteen, and Dave Grohl – for the Foo Fighters frontman's first public performance since the death of Taylor Hawkins in March.
Dave was up first on the night, with Paul introducing him to the crowd by saying: “Now, I’ve got a little surprise for you: your hero from the west coast of America – Dave Grohl!”
He revealed that Dave flew in ""especially to do this"", with the pair then performing The Beatles' I Saw Her Standing There and Wings' Band On The Run together. Immediately following that it was The Boss' turn, with Bruce coming out to play Glory Days and The Beatles' I Wanna Be Your Man.
Finally, the grand finale saw both Dave and Bruce returning to join Paul for final song The End. Magical.See Paul and Dave performing Band On The Run at Glastonbury below:Paying tribute to Taylor following his passing, Sir Paul shared in a statement at the time:
""Taylor’s sudden death came as a shock to me and the people who knew and loved him.
""Not only was he a great drummer but his personality was big and shiny and will be sorely missed by all who were lucky to live and work alongside him.
""I was asked by the Foo Fighters to play on one of their tracks. It turned out that they wanted me to play drums! – on one of Taylor’s songs. This request came from a group with two amazing drummers! It was an incredible session and cemented my relationship with Taylor and the guys. Later they asked if I would induct them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I sang with them on Get Back. Taylor provided a powerhouse drum part. I’ll never forget that night. All of which made it much more of a desperately sad shock to hear he had died. So thanks Taylor for sharing some glorious minutes with me. You were a true Rock and Roll hero and will always remain in my heart.
""God bless his family and band – Love Paul X""

“House Of Mirrors is a song of self-reflection and redemption,” says HU leader Johnny 3 Tears. “No matter how far you run you can’t escape the person staring back at you in the mirror. One day we all have to face ourselves… and hopefully we can look back and not have to look away at what we see.”
On how the collaboration went, Jelly Roll says, ""I’ve been a fan of Hollywood Undead for a long time — it was surreal to get to work with them. Everything just clicked in the studio that day the record is a perfect representation of where we all were at that point in our lives.""

Their third full-length, Death Is Nothing To Us, is due out on August 18 via Run For Cover Records, and as we’ve come to expect from the band, will seemingly be another vulnerable, powerful listen.
“I don’t want people to romanticise grief and depression, myself included,” explains vocalist Pat Flynn. “But I wanted to write about the way loss can perpetuate this feeling of sadness in your life. I didn’t intend to make some kind of thematic trilogy but there is this connection to the first two records, and this album sort of rounds out some of the stages of grief that weren’t addressed previously – especially this feeling of stickiness that a depressive attitude can have.” 
To mark the announcement Fiddlehead have revealed lead single Sullenboy – check that out below:See the full album tracklist:

EndEx.
Fours years on from 2019’s Metawar, the band will
be releasing EndEx on September 22 via Century Media, and they’re giving fans
more of a taste of what to expect with new tune Scorpion…
Says vocalist Alexis Mincolla: “The scorpion
symbolises the challenge to confront and integrate those parts of ourselves
that we repress, ignore, or fear. It invites a descent into the depths of the
personal and collective unconscious. Its venom is the entropic catalyst for the
dissolution of old, rigid structures of the psyche, making room for rebirth. To
acknowledge and embrace the scorpion is to accept the necessity of change.”

Kerrang!;Avenged Sevenfold’s new album is “90 per cent” done as they finally record orchestral parts — Kerrang!;The final pieces of the puzzle are being put into place for the new Avenged Sevenfold album, with drummer Brooks Wackerman revealing that “it’s unlike anything we’ve ever released”…;"Alllllll the way back in December 2020, M. Shadows told Kerrang! that Avenged Sevenfold had been ""trying to get string sections together"" to record material for their new album, but had been struggling to make it all happen due to the pandemic. But now, over a year later, they've finally been able to get it done.
Taking to Twitter on February 10, the singer shared some snaps from the studio: of the huge 78-piece orchestra doing their thing, and of him and guitarist Syn Gates clearly giving their approval to what they're hearing. ""Twas worth the wait,"" M. tweeted.
Drummer Brooks Wackerman also excitedly gave an update on the record – the follow-up to 2016's The Stage – writing on Instagram: ""Well… this happened on Tuesday. We – Avenged Sevenfold – started writing this record 4 years ago and I can’t believe we are 90% done… One of the perks – in the creative process – is that we are able to track a 78-piece orchestra on our records. The fact that we are able to bring incredible musicians together to enhance our art still gives me chills…
""I can’t wait for the the world to hear this… all I can say it’s unlike anything we’ve ever released.. ALRIGHT and good night!""
Cannot. Wait.Teasing what's to come, M. Shadows told Metal Hammer in January that, “We’re very influenced by Kanye West. The thing about Kanye is that he is pulling from such great soul music. I didn’t grow up with that stuff – my dad listened to Boston and Alice Cooper, I didn’t get that taste of black music and old soul. So, diving deep into jazz musicians… we’re not trying to do a jazz record, but the chord changes and progressions are so eye-opening to us.”
He also told Louder Than Life last July that A7X plan to release the record ""before summer"" 2022.
“The reason we don’t say much about the music is because we find that every single word we say about it just gets spun off, and there’s no way to describe music; it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s heavy, it’s fast…’ What are we gonna say about it?” he said. “It’s a work of art that we’ve worked on for a long time, we had a bunch of personal things that we’ll explain later… but we’re booking shows for next summer, and the record will be out before then.”

Kerrang!;Greta Van Fleet announce new album Starcatcher, release lead single;Watch the video for Greta Van Fleet’s brand-new single Meeting The Master, taken from their upcoming third album Starcatcher.;"Following some teasing this week, Greta Van Fleet
have just announced details of their highly-anticipated third album
Starcatcher.
The follow-up to 2021’s The Battle At Garden’s
Gate will arrive on July 21 via Lava / Republic Records, with lead single
Meeting The Master out now (watch the video below).
Say GVF of their new song: “Meeting The Master peers
into an esoteric world heeded by the word of a wise teacher. Sung in the voice
of a devout believer, and eventual group exclamation, the song details the love
these fervent followers have for their teacher and their firm belief in his
vision. It’s an exotic spiritual journey. A dark comedy that inevitably ends in
chaos.”
Watch the video for Meeting The Master below:Of Starcatcher as a whole, guitarist Jake Kizska enthuses of the creative process: “We didn’t really have to force or be intense about writing, because everything that happened was very instinctual. If anything, the record is our perspective, and sums up where we are as a group and individually as musicians.”
On a grander scale, bassist/keyboardist Sam teases
that, “When I imagine the world of Starcatcher, I think of the cosmos. It makes
me ask a lot of questions, like, ‘Where did we come from?’ or, ‘What are we
doing here?’ But it’s also questions like, ‘What is this consciousness that we
have, and where did it come from?’”

Kerrang!;Botch release first new song in 20 years;Listen to One Twenty Two, the first new music from Washington metalcore heroes Botch in two decades.;"No, your eyes aren't deceiving you, Botch have actually released new music in the form of One Twenty Two.
It's the first new music we've heard from the seminal metalcore crew, having disbanded in 2002, following beloved and hugely influential second album We Are The Romans – which is being reissued on CD and vinyl on November 4 via Sargent House.
And it's on this reissue we find new track One Twenty Two, which came together accidentally yet serendipitously according to guitarist David Knudson.
“During COVID, I was writing my debut solo LP, and mentally, I was sick of everything in quarantine,"" he says. ""Lots of frustration had set in at home, and I figured the best way to deal with it was to write something heavy. I had no intention of writing anything for Botch, but when I was thinking of a singer to collaborate with, I thought, 'Hey, I know the best hardcore singer ever to do it,' so I hit up Dave [Verellen, Botch vocalist]. He was super-excited and so it just kind of snowballed from there. There was never any intent or conversation about getting back together or writing. It just happened so naturally and was a great release for all of us to make it happen without any of the traditional pressure an 'active' band faces.”
Will we get more new Botch music? It sounds unlikely, but let's all revel in the fact that we have at least one more song from one of the most underrated bands in 21st century heavy music. Check out the video below.We Are The Romans reissue tracklist:

Alongside the announcement, the band have released new single Potential. Speaking about the track, vocalist and guitarist Erik Garlington says, ""My entire life I've been told I have so much wasted potential... I excelled at school, when I wanted to be there, but didn't walk at graduation. I don't even have a yearbook photo. Then I skipped out on college, even though I had some good schools interested in me for culinary arts. And then, and then, and then... This track is me mulling over the central theme of the record. We simply have too much potential to stagnate and accept being just an 'opener band'.""Part-Timer tracklist

Kerrang!;Halsey approaching new album with “no strict genre parameters”;After working with Nine Inch Nails on 2021’s If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power, Halsey says album number five has no genre right now, and it’s just about “making what feels good and what hits home”.;"Over a year ago, Halsey revealed that she would be “making a pop album” following 2021’s Nine Inch Nails-produced If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power. But now the musician has stated that their current approach is about having “no strict genre parameters”.
When asked by a fan on social media about how the new album is coming along, Halsey reveals that her songwriting is “definitely some of my best”, and it’s most akin to that of 2020 third album Manic in the sense of it being about “just making what feels good and what hits home”.
“As of right now I’m approaching it kinda how I approached Manic,” Halsey writes. “No strict genre parameters or anything. Just making what feels good and what hits home :) definitely some of my best songwriting. a lot of life has happened to me since I wrote IICHLIWP.”
A couple of months back, PEOPLE reported that Halsey had parted ways with longtime label Capitol Records, so it remains to be seen how album number five will be released. “After 8 great years the decision to leave Capitol is bittersweet, but we are excited about exploring a new partnership and sharing new music with fans,” said Halsey’s managers, Jason Aron and Anthony Li.

Rather than embarking down the well-trodden path of visiting Manchester, Glasgow and London and calling it a tour, the Welsh rockers are admirably hitting up some of the UK's less-toured areas this January and February.
Alongside their friends in Void Of Vision, the Live & In Monochrome tour will visit 16 towns and cities across the UK including Hull, Colchester, Lincoln and Carlisle. And you better believe Holding Absence are treating their fans to a knockout setlist – from In Circles to Like A Shadow to the frankly epic Afterlife.

Kerrang!;Green Day share Wake Me Up When September Ends x Mariah Carey mash-up;Green Day’s Wake Me Up When September Ends gets mashed-up with Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You. Why does this work so well?!;"It’s September, which means it’s time for Green Day fans to start listening even more to the band’s American Idiot mega single Wake Me Up When September Ends (in fact, a few years ago it was reported that they make extra money during this time as streams and views surge). 
However, this year it seems as though Billie Joe Armstrong and co. are looking even further ahead than September and indeed October: in fact, they’ve got a view on Christmas already. Taking to TikTok, the punk rock legends have shared a hilarious (and surprisingly great) new mash-up of Wake Me Up… and Mariah Carey’s festive classic All I Want For Christmas Is You.
“Heyahaha look it’s a Green Day wake me up when September ends and Mariah Carey all I want for Christmas mash-up,” reads the TikTok caption, with the original posted by self-described ‘mash-up messiah’ @djcummerbund.
The song combines Billie Joe’s vocals with Mariah’s instrumentals, and, honestly, for such a sad and emotional single, it somehow still works so well over the uplifting music.

Kerrang!;Architects’ Sam Carter: “We need to address the way we speak to each…;An important reminder from Architects vocalist Sam Carter: people in bands are human beings, and even if you don’t like their music, “You just don’t need to insult me or bring up my best mate…”;"To mark the release of their 4/5-rated new album the classic symptoms of a broken spirit, Architects hit the cover of Kerrang! this week to talk about the creative freedom they’ve experienced making it, mental health, eyeliner and much more.
And in the huge new interview, frontman Sam Carter reflects on some of the negative feedback the band have had from their fans on this album cycle – which he doesn’t mind, but is completely against how insensitively these comments have sometimes been made. “It’s like people don’t think of you as a person, you’re just in a band and your life’s easy,” Sam reflects, going on to discuss the hurtful things people have said about Architects ‘not being the same’ without late guitarist Tom Searle.
“I think about Tom every second of every day,” the vocalist continues. “I can’t hear the word Architects without thinking about him. And I’ve seen so many people say, ‘Tom would be ashamed of this, Tom would hate this record, Tom would do this.’ It’s like, ‘You don’t even get to fucking say his name.’ Tom was the main songwriter, and we’ve all learned how to be songwriters in Architects now. We’ve worked so hard to create this. It would have been so much easier to just go, ‘I can’t do this. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t try and imitate this, man.’ We’re trying to not rip off our friend’s songs – I can’t just ask Josh [Middleton, guitar] to write some riffs that sound like Tom’s. How insulting would that be?”
Detailing the hypocrisy of people on social media, Sam adds: “It’s mad that people [say things like this], and then go, ‘It’s okay not to be okay.’ We need to address the way we speak to each other because it’s fucking horrible. I’m not asking you to love it. Music’s completely subjective. I’m pretty sure a lot of our fans don’t want to hear about why Side B on Revolver by The Beatles is the best. We’re not going to agree. If you don’t like it you don’t like it – you just don’t need to insult me or bring up my best mate.”

Kerrang!;The Osbournes to return to reality TV for new BBC series, Home To…;BBC are bringing the Osbourne family back to our TV screens for a “funny, moving and honest” new show documenting their move home to the UK.;"BBC have announced a new 10-part series documenting the Osbourne family’s move back to the UK from Los Angeles, entitled Home To Roost.
Yes indeed, Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack will be returning to our screens for a brand-new reality TV special, which will see the iconic family heading home to Buckinghamshire over 20 years on from their move across the pond (which was of course documented in legendary and beloved series The Osbournes).
As well as their journey back, Home To Roost is set to capture the family ‘as they celebrate one of their most important years yet – with everything from Sharon’s 70th birthday to Kelly’s soon-to-be-born baby, Ozzy’s tour, and of course the big move itself.’
“I’m delighted that the Osbournes will be sharing this next chapter in their lives with BBC viewers in what promises to be a funny, moving and honest insight into their new life in the UK,” enthuses Clare Sillery, Head of Commissioning, Documentaries.
Ben Wicks and Colin Barr – Creative Directors of Expectation – continue: “Rejoining the Osbournes as they return to the UK is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Twenty years ago, they shaped television for all of us – now they’re coming home at a different stage in their lives but with the promise of the same laughter, love and tears. We can’t wait to work with them and to share it with BBC One viewers in 2023.”

Kerrang!;Sid Wilson’s old mask turned into animatronic puppet that sings along…;Watch Sid Wilson’s old mask sing along to Slipknot live onstage – yes, it is as unsettling as it sounds.;"Last week, in a Kerrang! world-exclusive, Slipknot unveiled their new masks for the new era, and it's safe to say that DJ Sid Wilson has truly outdone himself this time. In the past we've seen him in a wide array of gas masks and skulls, but for upcoming album The End, So Far, he has gone full cyborg – complete with robotic hands and sci-fi-esque gilded facegear.
But rather than throwing his previous fleshy veil in the bin, Sid has transformed his We Are Not Your Kind era mask into an animatronic puppet of sorts that appears to 'sing' along onstage. Yes, you read that right, and it's the stuff of nightmares.
Check out the footage of it creepily mouthing along to The Chapeltown Rag below.Speaking to Kerrang! about Sid's new robotic outfit, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor said, “His whole thing… I’m just like, ‘What the fuck is happening?’ It’s incredible. He didn’t show us until [we made] the videos. 
“I don’t want to give too much away, but you’ve gotta ask him about the journey it took to get that fucking mask together, because he’ll talk to you about it for a good 20 minutes... It’s a fucking horror story! Anybody who’s been waiting on new shit to show up on a deadline will understand the panic that Sid Wilson was going through. I listen to it and cackle, because it’s one of those moments where you know what adrenaline tastes like (laughs).”
Slipknot will release their seventh album The End, So Far on September 30 via Roadrunner.

Loudwire;Amorphis Unveil North American Tour Dates With Sylvaine + Hoaxed;It will be Sylvaine's first-ever North American tour.;"Amorphis will release Halo, their 14th album, in February and two months after that, the Finnish band has set their sights on a headlining North American tour with Sylvaine and Hoaxed.The 23-date run through the U.S. and Canada features a diverse billing as all three bands offer a unique sense of duality in their music. Amorphis have long stood as a malleable act, true to their name (but not to the spelling of 'amorphous') just as capable of discharging death-addled grooves and roars as they are at spellbinding listeners with resplendent melodies and sing-song passages.For the Norwegian post-black metal act Sylvaine, this will be her first-ever North American tour as she supports her fourth album, Nova, which drops on March 4. Openers Hoaxed, a ghastly rock duo from Oregon, will be out touting last year's self-titled EP.""We are more than excited to announce that we are touring North America in the Spring 2022 to support our upcoming album Halo,"" began Amorphis in a press statement. ""We’ve been missing you, live gigs, and touring like never before!

Loudwire;Trivium to 'Take a True Break' After Current Album-Tour Cycle;'There's no plans' for a new album right now, says Heafy.;"Trivium have been one of the more prolific metal bands of the 21st Century, and while singer Matt Heafy always seems active with music through his social media, the singer revealed in a new interview that the band will actually be taking a break after their current album-tour cycle ends.Speaking with EMP (as heard below) at the Summer Breeze Festival, singer Matt Heafy confirmed, ""Normally we are always, we're so open with everything — we show everything we do, we talk about everything — but the one thing we are always secretive about is the records. But this time I can say that we're just going on a proper break this time. Because we've done 10 albums of 'album-tour, album-tour.'""He adds, ""This time, when this tour cycle ends, we're gonna take a true break, and instead of working on music, we're actually gonna work on building our Hangar studio, so that way when it comes time to make records, we can do that again. But there are currently no plans for a new record. And I'm not being deceitful there. There's no plans right now.""The hangar that Heafy is referring to is the band's current home base in Orlando, Florida. The group purchased an old airplay hangar back in 2020 with the intent of turning it into a performance space, rehearsal area and home studio.The vocalist also addressed multiple times the band's longevity and continuous hard work that has going into their career. At one point he noted, ""We've been on this two-year long world tour and we will hit 208 shows on this one record in three weeks, which is a lot,"" while later adding, ""By the end of this year, I will have been in Trivium for 25 or 26 years and we'll be a 2020-plus career shows and it's been great. I love it.""While it remains to be seen how long ""a true break"" is for the band, it's definitely well earned. As noted within the chat, the band is coming off the shortest turnaround between albums during their tenure, with their previous record, What the Dead Men Say, arriving just shy of a year-and-a-half prior in 2020. At present, they've released 10 albums over an 18-year period, starting with their 2023 album Ember to Inferno.READ MORE: The Best Cover Songs From 50 of Metal's Biggest BandsTrivium are currently on the road in support of their 2021 album, In the Court of the Dragon, with the tour leg taking place in Europe winding down on Sept. 7 in Southampton, England in the U.K. Remaining dates can be found here.Trivium's Matt Heafy Speaks With EMP at the 2023 Summer Breeze Festival29 Most Prolific Rock + Metal Artists of the 21st Century (10 or More Albums)Who needs a break?";2023-08-17;https://loudwire.com/trivium-take-true-break-after-current-tour/;2023-08-20;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETRIVIUMTO'TAKEATRUEBREAK'AFTERCURRENTALBUM-TOURCYCLE

The UK heavy metal giants are known for famously using their own plane to get to shows (often steered by singer/pilot Bruce Dickinson himself), but now they're extending some luxury accommodations to fans.In Sweden on Friday night, 300 lucky people got to ride the exclusive ""Train 666"" to Iron Maiden's gig in Gothenburg, Sweden. From front to caboose, the whole locomotive was specially outfitted in trademark Iron Maiden artwork and décor. And passengers were greeted with a one-of-a-kind goodie bag filled with a mask of mascot Eddie, a poster and an exclusive red vinyl record with ""Stratego"" on one side and ""The Number Of The Beast"" on the other side, designed - per the band's orders - to look like a bootleg.""Sweden has always been important to Maiden so we thought they deserved us to go an extra 110%, and we wanted to put on an experience and event for their fans,"" said Darren Edwards (international products manager at Warner Music) in a video tour posted by Sveriges Television in Sweden.He added, ""The whole band flew in early, Steve's playing futbol the day before the show, as he often does when he's in Sweden, Nicko is probably playing golf ...so there's just this special connection, they love Sweden, and they know the fans are really special over here.""A Video Tour Of Iron Maiden's ""Train 666""Iron Maiden also shared a look inside ""Train 666"" on Twitter where they posted, ""All aboard Train 666 bound for Gothenburg!

Loudwire;GoFundMe Launched to Help Venom Legend Abaddon With Cancer Treatment + Other Expenses;See the drummer's post.;"UPDATE (Oct. 17, 2022): A GoFundMe has been launched to help Abaddon with medical expenses and to assist in covering his loss of income while undergoing treatment. To donate, head here.Anthony ""Abaddon"" Bray, an early drummer in English metal pioneers Venom, shared this month that he's been diagnosed with lymphoma, a cancer that affects the blood and lymphatic system.In an online post from Bray that was reported by Brave Words and Metal Injection, the 62-year-old musician outlined how he discovered he had the disease and detailed his treatment to combat it. ""None of this will break me,"" Bray said. ""Fuck cancer.""The Venom alum received the cancer diagnosis from doctors after he noticed a mass in his neck earlier this year. A biopsy showed he had lymphoma. Further tests revealed the indication of cancer elsewhere in his body. He is already undergoing chemotherapy and will also receive radiotherapy.Bray, part of Venom's classic lineup, played in the band from 1978 to 1992, returning in 1995 until 1999. He was later part of Venom Inc with fellow Venom members Jeff ""Mantas"" Dunn and Tony ""Demolition Man"" Dolan, but he no longer performs with them. (Four years ago, Dunn was recovering from a heart attack.)Read Bray's post below. Loudwire sends best wishes to him and his family.Anthony ""Abaddon"" Bray Statement - September 2022I noticed a mass growing on the side of my neck in July 2022, I thought it was maybe an insect bite as I live near the sea and it was a hot month here.The mass grew bigger and, urged by my wife Rachel, I went to see my GP who reassured me that it was most likely not cancer because cancerous lumps don't come up over night usually, rather they take a longer time to grow. However she referred me to the freeman hospital in Newcastle to a specialist who reiterated her thoughts on the speed of my growth.He did some tests then sent me straight away for a biopsy, I had three samples taken and then went back to see my specialist who said that sadly it was lymphoma a cancer of the blood.He sent me immediately for a CT scan and an MRI scan which showed that I also had cancer in my bowel and lower intestinal tract.He decided therefore to not operate on my neck but to refer me to haematology at wandsbeck hospital in Ashington.They decided on 6 cycles of chemotherapy which I started yesterday.I will also be referred back to freeman hospital for radiotherapy after a few bouts of chemotherapy.Non of this will break me.Fuck cancer.Abaddon.100 Inspirational Quotes From Rock StarsA reassuring remark can be a real pick-me-up.

Loudwire;Rob Zombie Appears to Confirm That a Classic Member Has Rejoined the Band;It's another chapter in Rob Zombie's career.;"After returning to the stage with Rob Zombie for the first time in nearly 20 years late last year, it appears classic guitarist Mike Riggs is here to stay in the wake of John 5 joining Motley Crue.Three weeks before it was confirmed that John 5 (who joined in 2005) had indeed landed the role as Mick Mars' replacement in the veteran hair metal group, Riggs performed with Zombie at the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento, California on Oct. 6.Fans have since wondered what this means for the future of Zombie's band and if Riggs was just filling the vacancy in an emergency-type situation or if this was going to be a more permanent solution. Now, in a recent social media post, the figurehead shared a live photo of himself, bassist Piggy D and Riggs, stating, ""They're back from the dead and ready to party.""The post was accompanied by hashtags for each member of the band, as well as #returnofthelivingdead. Presumably, that last hashtag, with the mention of the word ""return,"" indicates that Riggs will continue to sling riffs with Rob Zombie and co. moving forward.Riggs' first stint in Rob Zombie lasted from 1997 through 2003, where he contributed to Zombie's only platinum records in the U.S. — 1998's Hellbilly Deluxe debut and 2001's The Sinister Urge.During John 5's tenure, another five albums were released, the latest being 2021's The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy, which reached No. 9 on the Billboard 200.11 Bands That Never Reunited With Their Classic SingerPour one out for these former vocalists.17 Non-Singer Lineup Changes That Impacted Rock + MetalSwitching singers is one thing, but what about the rock and metal lineup changes that didn't involve a lead vocalist?

Loudwire;The Best Metal Album Of All Time?;Is Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast' the greatest heavy metal album of all time?;"What's the best heavy metal album of all time? Well, we could definitely make an argument for Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast.Number of the Beast was the album that took Iron Maiden from New Wave of British Heavy Metal purveyors to one of the greatest metal bands of all time. That alone put's it in the running for the title of Best Metal Album Of All Time.In this mini Maiden documentary we dive into the risks Iron Maiden took on Number of the Beast that led them to greatness.READ MORE: Ranking the Closing Song on Every Iron Maiden AlbumNumber of the Beast was released in March of 1982 and would become the bands first to top the U.K. Albums chart. It has since sold more than 20 million records across the world, and is regarded as one of the most important metal albums of all time.Throughout the album, there are definitely morbid subject matters, some are gory just for the sake of being gory, but there’s no denying that with Number of the Beast as an album, Iron Maiden solidified themselves as being great storytellers, too.Speed and soaring guitars were already elements of the band from before, but Number of the Beast was the first instance in which they adopted a pure metal sound; something they would go on to make famous.At the time, Number of the Beast represented a high-water mark for the heavy metal genre. It struck a balance between accessible melodicism and challenging intensity. Even 40-plus years later, the operatic nature of the songs, the tight performances, never mind Bruce’s incredible voice, has held up remarkably.It was a big gamble replacing their proven frontman with a kid in his early 20s and in pivoting their sound away from that punky edge. But it was that gamble that helped turn Iron Maiden from a cog in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal genre into one of the most important metal bands of all time.Learn more about the risks that led to Iron Maiden took, making Number of the Beast one of the best metal albums of all time in the documentary below.The Best Metal Album Of All Time?Iron Maiden's Eddie - A Look at Over 40 Years of Metal's Best MascotIron Maiden's undead mascot Eddie, as seen on single and album art throughout the band's 40-plus year history.";2023-03-10;https://loudwire.com/best-metal-album-ever-iron-maiden-number-of-the-beast/;2023-03-11;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETHEBESTMETALALBUMOFALLTIME?
Loudwire;NOFX’s Fat Mike Is Opening the World’s First Punk Museum;Its doors are set to open this winter.;"How there isn't already a punk rock museum is beyond us, but thanks to NOFX's Fat Mike, one will soon exist. The frontman is planning on opening the very first punk museum in the world, and it'll be located in Las Vegas, Nev. and literally called The Punk Rock Museum.As reported by Spin, the 12,000-square-foot museum is set to open on Jan. 13, 2023 and will contain a wide array of punk-related relics from artists such as Debbie Harry, Devo, Rise Against, Sum 41 and more. There will also be exhibits that fans can engage with, including playing instruments.“If you’re a punk band, you’re fucking in,” Fat Mike explained of the criteria to be accepted in the museum. “It’s that simple.”The musician organized a panel of 10 people called the ""punk rock collective"" to help bring his idea for the museum to life, which he referred to as a ""Church of punk rock."" In addition to showcasing artifacts from punk rock musicians, the educational side of the museum aims to teach how influential the punk rock genre has been on music throughout the years. Foo Fighters' Pat Smear, Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman and Tony Hawk are among the investors who've helped make it a reality, too.One of the collective members is Vinnie Fiorello, who also played in Less Than Jake and founded record labels Fueled by Ramen and Paper + Plastick.“This is a love letter to punk rock,” he said of the museum.  “We want to show this common passion amongst so many different people for this form of music.”“We want people to come from Indonesia and see the flier of their band on the wall,” Fat Mike further added. “You know how proud they would feel? I want anyone in a punk band around the world to have that opportunity.”Pre-sale tickets for the museum are available on its website now. There are a variety of packages available for those who simply want to explore the museum, and also for artists who want to become part of it.

They were the first two shows of their ""No Repeat Weekend"" run, which will run into late 2024.The point of the tour, aside from the band getting to play the new 72 Seasons tracks live, is so Metallica can play two shows in the same city without repeating any songs in the setlist. Fans obviously have the option to attend one show instead of two, but those who are in it for both will get to hear the most material played live.Get Metallica Tickets HereThe trek kicked off April 27 in Amsterdam, with ""Orion"" as the set opener. It was the first time they played the track live since 2011 [via Setlist.fm], and they also debuted the new songs ""Screaming Suicide"" and ""Sleepwalk My Life Away."" During the second show, which took place April 29, they tackled ""Until It Sleeps"" for the first time since '08, and also debuted ""72 Seasons,"" ""If Darkness Had a Son"" and ""You Must Burn!"" [via Setlist.fm].""I don't know the idea that if people go to a show on one day, if they understand that there may not be certain toe-tapping favorites, as they may be called, that they will not hear,"" Lars Ulrich told Japan's Rock City. ""I don't know if they fully understand that concept, and I don't know if it matters. At the end of the day, it's a fun experiment, and when you've been playing for as long as we have and playing as many shows as we have, I think it's important to keep coming up with new ideas, to keep it fresh for the fans and fresh for yourselves."" READ MORE: Lars Ulrich on the NEXT Metallica Album - 'There Are Some Ideas We Could Start With'Looking at both setlists, it's certainly surprising to not see ""Enter Sandman"" on some of the nights, but it's clear that they plan on bringing out a lot of deep cuts throughout this tour.Scroll through the gallery of photos below to see shots of the band from both nights in Amsterdam, and get your Metallica tickets here.See Photos From the First Two Nights of Metallica's '72 Seasons' TourPhotos from the first two nights of Metallica's 72 Seasons tour.Rock + Metal Bands That Played 150 Shows in a YearThese bands had intense touring schedules.

But it was on Seasons in the Abyss, which came out October 9, 1990, that Slayer found a confident middle ground between sheer velocity and malicious mid-paced chugging.The band started working on the new songs almost immediately after getting off tour. Continuing from the war and real-life atrocity themes they successfully explored on South of Heaven, Slayer crafted songs about the horrors of the battlefield, nuclear war, street gangs and, of course, serial killers.“I just think we just wanted to keep being Slayer,” guitarist Kerry King told me in 1994. “There were a lot of bands that had built careers by copying what we had done and we wanted to show everyone we could still do it better.”Slayer, ""War Ensemble""Guitarist Jeff Hanneman worked on the music for seven of the 10 songs on the album (two with King), but only contributed lyrics to two songs, “War Ensemble” and “Hallowed Point,” which he wrote with bassist and vocalist Tom Araya. The singer wrote lyrics for four other songs on his own, while King wrote music on his own for three songs and lyrics for four.“Back then we collaborated a little more on stuff,” Araya said. “I worked with Kerry on ‘Expendable Youth.’ Jeff, Kerry and I all wrote ‘War Ensemble’ together. We knew we had great songs and we wanted the lyrics to be as powerful as they could be as well.”In March, 1990 Slayer entered Hit City West studio in Los Angeles with producer Rick Rubin. Over the next four months the band also worked at Hollywood Sound and Record Plant. “I don’t remember anything really special about the recording session,” King says. “We were all just excited to get these songs out there. It felt like the session went pretty smoothly.”One of the highlights of the album, and a longtime staple of the band’s live show, was “Dead Skin Mask,” a song based on the nefarious deeds of Plainfield, Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, who, in the 50s, made trophies out of his victim’s bones, skin and organs. “Jeff wrote the music and I took off with the lyrics,” Araya said. “I just pictured what it must be like to be in this guy’s head. You’ve got to be really f---ed up to cut up people’s faces and make masks out of them.”Slayer, ""Dead Skin Mask""Seasons in the Abyss reached number 40 on the Billboard album chart, which, at that point, was Slayer’s highest position in their career. The album went gold in April, 1993. Slayer supported Seasons in the Abyss with a lengthy tour that included the legendary Clash of the Titans tour, which included Megadeth, Anthrax and Alice in Chains (a European version preceded the U.S. dates, but replaced Anthrax and Alice in Chains with Testament and Suicidal Tendencies)“There might have even been talk of a ‘Big Four’ tour back then, but we probably couldn’t get Metallica onboard,” said King. “But it was a big to do, man, and people came out for it. At the time, that was the biggest tour we had been on and the timing couldn’t have been more perfect.”Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Read Loudwire’s original report about it below.Tool's Maynard James Keenan appeared to be challenging Florida's new ""anti-drag"" bills when he performed in drag, donning prosthetic breasts, exaggerated lipstick and a blonde wig for Tool's Welcome to Rockville set Sunday (May 21) in Daytona Beach, Florida, according to Consequence.See photos from the Tool performance below.Earlier this month, Florida Gov.

Loudwire;There’s a ‘Reptilian Christian Christ Violence’ Band That Bathes Fans in Blood at Shows ;Not to mention the wrestling and flamethrowers.;"Thought you knew every subgenre of heavy music? Well, how well versed are you on Reptilian Christian Christ Violence? If you're not, then perhaps the hardcore punk-leaning Cancer Christ can be your entry way, with the band starting to pick up some attention for their theatrically bizarre performances.As tipped by The Mirror, the band recently played Los Angeles' Barroom Blitz where they attempted to ""cleans the damned"" with bloodbath baptisms. But the fun doesn't stop there with no-ring wrestling matches taking place as well and as displayed in a series of Instagram photos, the fun carried out into the streets with a flamethrower being used as the audience members gathered around.The band said of the show, ""Thursday was nuts and beautiful and insanely historic,"" before later adding, ""Thanks also to our newest Church member @not_alex_kent_ for these biblical moments in time that prove, without a doubt, that God is not dead! God bless you all!""A closer look at their Instagram reveals footage and photos from past shows as well, including a wedding ceremony that took place at a Cancer Christ show.So who are Cancer Christ and what are they all about? The band's website reads, ""Cancer Christ has seen the ailing not too distant future of this godless world. Our bleak existence needs a new, stronger word of God. Cancer Christ is the imperfect vessel to wage a holy war against those who wish to profit from a dying prophet’s words. Cancer Christ understands evil must be fought with true words and even truer actions; fire must be met with fire, darkness must be met with searing and powerful holy light.""They also share an inclusive message stating, ""The mission of Cancer Christ is to find lost souls to take up arms in this new and uncertain heavenly body. We accept all: black, white, gay, straight, trans and all others that wish to fight evil wherever it spews its putrid and vile wickedness.""The band's leader, Anthony Melhaff, told No Echo in a 2021 interview, that after living a life of sin and darkness, he decided to serve punk rock in the name of faith. ""I stand for all the would-be scum that never considered Jesus an option,"" says the musician, adding, ""For the millions of demon worshippers that think Satan is tough or sick or down. I stand to let all those bitches know that God bitch slapped Lucifer out of heaven and only then did that punk-bitch become Satan. God fucks the hardest and he’s ready to fuck the world, whether you believe or not.""The band has already issued several videos for songs with titles such as ""The Blood of Jesus"" and ""Do You Wanna Go to Heaven.""

Loudwire;6 Sweet Things HIM Fans Will Love About Ville Valo's New Album 'Neon Noir';Welcome back, Ville! We've missed you.;"Welcome back, Ville Valo! It's been 10 years since Finland's ""love metal"" heartthrob has put out a new album, the last being HIM's swansong, Tears on Tape and here are six sweet things HIM fans will love about Neon Noir.Our beloved deep crooner crept back into the musical spotlight back in 2020 with the release of Gothica Fennica Vol. 1, a three-track EP featuring ""Salute the Sanguine,"" ""Run Away From the Sun"" and ""Saturnine Saturnalia,"" all of which also appear on Valo's brand new LP. More than formidable, it demonstrated that even without the members of HIM behind him, his signature style was still as recognizable as it ever was before.""The reason for the EP was to test the waters, to see if people are still interested in the kind of racket I make, and also to check and see if there’s labels who might be interested in putting this stuff out,” Valo told Loudwire in an exclusive interview near the end of last year.“[The lockdowns were] quite depressing, quite dark … Everything was uncertain, regarding everything here. There were areas in Finland that were closed off, you weren’t able to drive outside of the city, it was like being in a dystopian sci-fi film. I thought it was so depressing that the only thing I could do was to continue to keep on making music,"" he reasoned.If you're the type to find a silver lining in any situation, then Valo's decision to concentrate on new music early on in the pandemic is a sterling one.For HIM fans, there's plenty of ways to connect the dots to Ville's former band as well as fresh new dynamics that were never present within HIM's sound. Nevertheless, here's six sweet things HIM fans will love about Neon Noir:1. It's like a reunion with an old friendReady to feel old? HIM’s final album was released 10 years ago. With Ville Valo going a full decade without making a “love metal” style LP, listening to Neon Noir feels like a warm reunion with an old friend. And like catching up with a high school bestie, Valo picked up right where he left off.The man’s voice still sounds as fantastic as ever, his vampyric lyrics on love and loss sit in the same vein as his work with HIM, and although Neon Noir takes a softer instrumental approach than Ville’s old band, the music evokes the same emotions as when Bam Margera reality shows ruled MTV. Damn Ville, it feels good to catch up. —Graham Hartmann2. “Baby, let’s take the scenic route through Hell”If you’re gonna be trekking through Hell, you might as well stop and smell the sulfur, right?While this is a really nice lyric from Valo that finishes off the second verse of opener “Echolocate Your Love,” it’s about so much more than that. It’s that we’ve missed this dangerous and dark sense of romance in heavy music ever since HIM split up.Love is the most intense emotion and, unless you’re a real asshole, the most important one. So many facets of love are lost in music as much of it tends to focus either on puppy dog type feelings or breakup heartache. Valo challenges you to revel in the darker shades of love, helping you realize that even when things go sideways, it’s always going to be the thing you pursue the hardest. —Joe DiVita3. Those familiar, warm tonesIt’s not everywhere on Neon Noir (“Baby Lachrimarium” would be robbed of its heavenly quality with rumbling, buzzsaw low end), but on the more driving tracks (“Salute the Sanguine,” “Neon Noir” — the two most HIM-like songs), that familiar bass sound that helped define HIM’s sound is back in action, all lying underneath those weighty guitars.It’s like a soothing hug — those low frequencies massaging your feet as the subwoofer pulses through your floor, potentially disturbing a downstairs neighbor in the process. —JD4. ‘80s vibes in the best wayOkay, okay, the nostalgic ‘80s aesthetic has pretty much run its course in popular culture, but when you’re an artist so deeply in love with the ‘80s as Ville Valo, the decade’s influence can not be separated from one’s DNA. Even if you’re sick of hearing “Blinding Lights” or seeing Tron-style animation on every YouTube channel, the ‘80s influence of Neon Noir will still please your palate.The synth riffs in “Echolocate Your Love,” “Salute the Sanguine” and “Neon Noir'' are just too good to cast aside, and I don’t care who you are, anything that gives you Lost Boys vibes can’t be bad. The point is, Ville Valo isn’t using ‘80s aesthetics to chase trends. HIM’s music always paid tribute to those synth-driven, melancholic and romantic ‘80s classics, and the band’s balance of those dynamics was always inspired. Neon Noir is no different. —GH5. “Loveletting”Holy fuck do I love “Loveletting.” One of the softest and most beautiful ballads Valo has ever released, “Loveletting” is the musician’s best standout single since “Heartkiller.” The track really shows off Valo’s producing prowess, and its gentle instrumentation blends perfectly with an anthemic chorus. Ville also explores his full vocal range throughout the song… well… his “I’m no longer smoking cigarettes” vocal range.The “Loveletting” music video is also a triumph, representing Ville’s embrace of the “black sheep” within himself. Ville has stated in numerous interviews that he’s always felt like an outsider or an outcast — something plenty of his fans can certainly relate with — and in this decade of increased isolation, the message of, “I don’t fit in, but that’s okay,” is an important one. Though it’s one of Ville’s sadder songs, “Loveletting” feels like the umbrella for one’s black sheep. —GH6. There’s good news if you love “The Path” and “Sleepwalking Past Hope”HIM’s longest songs were quite doomy in their approach, if not totally mirroring what one usually thinks of as doom when it comes to heavy music.These slow, plodding tracks that offered plenty of room to get lost in a dream haze are awfully hard to come by with Valo. Here, the nearly 8-minute closer “Vertigo Eyes” sends the record off in a similar manner to “The Path” on HIM’s 2003 album Love Metal.Neon Noir takes us through some bright and upbeat spots with some big new wave overtones, but it ends just the way anything with Valo should — not on a chipper note. —JDGet your copy of 'Neon Noir' here and follow Ville Valo on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Spotify.100 Best Rock and Metal Albums of the 21st CenturyLoudwire's picks for the best rock and metal albums from 2000 to present.";2023-01-13;https://loudwire.com/things-we-love-ville-valo-neon-noir-album/;2023-01-14;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE6SWEETTHINGSHIMFANSWILLLOVEABOUTVILLEVALO'SNEWALBUM'NEONNOIR'
Loudwire;How Alter Bridge's Myles Kennedy Learned 'There's More to Life Than a Living';The singer discusses taking his first break in years and how some self-analysis has fueled his songwriting.;"Alter Bridge are back and making the touring rounds again in support of their late 2022 album Pawns & Kings, but during a recent chat with Loudwire Nights, frontman Myles Kennedy revealed that he actually took a bit of a break from the grind over this past year, doing some self-inventory and learning more about who he is minus the rock star life that has consumed his world over the last few decades.Kennedy also reveals how some of the self-reflection and a continued inspection of his own songwriting affected the band's latest effort, Pawns & Kings, which is out now. Plus, he also shares his thoughts on the recent death of guitar great Jeff Beck, discusses the decision to pay it forward to the next generation of rockers with his Future Song foundation and more. Check out the chat below.You and Mark Tremonti wrote up a Loudwire piece about your favorite albums as a teenager, and one of the albums you chose was Van Halen’s self-titled album. We’re now days away from you going on tour with Wolfgang Van Halen and Mammoth WVH. Another album you chose was Appetite for Destruction by Guns N’ Roses, and of course, you’re part of Slash’s band. So when you piece these things together is there a part of you that feels this was written in the stars? I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be right now.Honestly, it really has me scratching my head, especially when you put it like that. I didn’t really think about it that way. How the hell did this happen? (Laughs). It’s kind of crazy because of the influence that those records had on me. So fast forward decades later and here we are and you just said that. Look, I’ve had a really strange life, a good life, but it does sometimes make me wonder if I’m living in The Matrix. Seriously, but I’m grateful, and I pinch myself every day.I think the answer to that is a combination of being a good human, which everyone agrees that you are, and talent. So that’s all you.Well, the thing is I know a lot of really talented wonderful humans that came up the ranks, so it’s hard not to go, ‘Why me?’ Seriously, there are folks that many years ago we started playing when we were kids and we crossed paths, so it’s interesting how life turns out, right?Get Alter Bridge Concert Tickets HereWe’re here to talk about Pawns & Kings. There’s definitely a story there with the lyrics. We start with ""This Is War"" and there’s a conflict, and our main character is kind of as low as low can be, surrounded by people who are manipulating him or her and presenting as something that they are not. Everything shifts in Track 5, that I want to talk about later, and then again at the end of the record. Even though you’re a pawn, you can truly be a king if you believe. I wonder if you went in with that story in mind and I also wonder what you were drawing from on those songs because it’s genius that you know exactly what the story is. You can follow it perfectly, but you can also apply it to any aspect of your life because it’s vague.It’s interesting, cause that’s the goal. And I think through years of songwriting I’ve learned not to leave it somewhat ambiguous and vague so that it can have multiple meanings otherwise you paint yourself into a corner and once the things that might have inspired you convey that lyric or whatever, suddenly it doesn’t age well. That doesn’t apply anymore. So I’ve really tried to be more cognizant and use that approach, and it’s hard sometimes. Sometimes you want to be a little more direct. Yeah, I’ve learned my lessons.But it is direct. Were you drawing from a particular area of your life or was it more a combination of experiences?Definitely a combination, because I’ve been a part of writing records over the years. There was the solo record I did back in 2017, 2018, Year of the Tiger, that was very much a concept record and there was a storyline throughout it. Ides of March, that was a solo record that was very much informed by what was going on with the state of the world. So I really want to be careful about every record.Interestingly enough, a bus driver, there was this really great bus driver and we were talking one day on a day off and he said to me, ‘You know, you really ought to be careful Myles, because you’re writing too many concept records.’ I was like, ‘Great, thank you bus driver. You are absolutely right.’ So with this record I wanted it to hit certain storylines, but more …. “This Is War” is a good example, that’s a personal thing. I struggle with anxiety and those voices that are always messing with you, telling you that you’re not worthy of going out on the road with these great artists. It’s that sort of thing that I constantly fight. It’s a good thing because I think you never get too comfortable that way.Then you fast forward to a song like “Pawns and Kings,” which could be more universal and the idea is that as people we shall all be aware that we can be empowered. You know, it’s the anthem for the underdog. So yeah, there are definite dynamics on this record that are definitely touched on in that way.Alter Bridge, ""Holiday""“Holiday” is the current single. I feel like that’s the kind of song that if you want to quit your job, listen to that song, play it a couple times and you’ll have big balls heading into your bosses office and be like, “I’m out of this bitch.” You remember during Covid, when everyone was like, “Work life balance, is this what I want to do? Is this fulfilling?” That’s what that song gave me, but what do you want to share about the meaning and how it came together?I think that what we saw with the great resignation during Covid did kind of nudge me to think about that. I don’t feel that you ever jump into a lyric just like, “I want to write about this today.” It’s just kind of floating in the ether and you’re just trying to pull it in. When that was said and done, yeah it could be that which you alluded to, but it could also be because of that fact that I’d just been going nonstop for a long time.There’s a key line in that song where it’s “there’s more to life than a living.” And I really took that to heart, this year in particular, in 2022. Because after the Alter Bridge record was finished, normally I would just start writing another record. That’s just the way I’ve done things for years. But I was like, “You know what? We’re going to officially power down. We’re officially taking a break, and now I’m gonna work on me.” Because I had a lot of things that needed to be addressed. So it was just self-improvement all year. It was just studying and working out and just trying to be a more well-rounded human being as opposed to being just a songwriter and a recording artist.What did that pause teach you about yourself, the main thing you really took out of it?I need to learn to get out of my own way. I think I needed to learn to just be. I always have to do. So much of my identity had become wrapped in records and tours and this thing that you think you are, and what I realize is I’m a being. I wanted to learn to be more present. I wanted to learn to be just here.I know that sounds kind of weird. But there’s something there that’s really been incredibly beneficial to me. I feel really good right now.You wanted to. Did you accomplish it?I feel much more at ease, yeah. I feel good, fucking good.Alter Bridge, ""Stay""Speaking of feeling good, a feel good song, “Stay,"" that’s where everything shifts. Suddenly there’s optimism, there’s hope, your eyes are wide open, I want to be the best person I can be. It feels different, but it sounds different cause Mark Tremonti handles lyrics on that song. I wonder if that was a conscious decision, because there’s such a shift in the record, that that was a great place to bring in Mark Tremonti or if there was another reason for him to be on vocals?It just happened. He brought that tune in, and it’s interesting because that song is such a breath of fresh air and so much of the record is so intense and then you have ""Stay"" and it’s like “Oh (exhales).” It’s a nice palette cleanser.It’s quintessential what Mark is really great at, which is a certain anthemic thing that he does really well. I feel like his voice has just gotten so good over the years and it was good to be showcased on that tune. I’m really happy.I was just rehearsing that tune yesterday because we’re getting ready for this upcoming tour and we were texting each other about what songs to try on this upcoming tour, and I was like, “Hey, what do you think about trying ‘Stay’?” So we’ll see if that happens, but I was practicing none the less, cause I do the harmonies. I was totally cursing myself, “Why did you have to do that (sings high note)? Come on and take off the tight underpants and sing in a lower register.” (Laughs). So hopefully we’ll do that track. I love that song.It’s a great tune. Now that you mention that, are songs from the previous album going to make the cut live, just because it didn’t get the promotion it deserved due to COVID? Does that affect whether or not you place those songs in the live set?We try to be aware of that. We just did a run in Europe of about six weeks and we’re like, look, we didn’t play a lot of these songs for these folks cause that tour got short-changed from Walk the Sky, so yeah, we’re definitely going to do a few songs from that previous record.We were talking about Mark Tremonti and his voice coming on strong. He came on for his charitable album, the Sinatra covers album, that blew my mind. And I’m happy now to have you on to talk about the charity of your choice that you’re involved with, Future Song, so what can you tell us about the charity and what they do and your involvement with it?The Future Song Foundation, we started that about six or seven years ago. We started in my community here in Spokane because we really just saw a need for picking up the slack because music programs have been cut drastically. There are so many young people that aren’t having the opportunities that my generation had with discovering music and the power it can have in your life, right?! So we just built it up over the years and it’s been wonderful to see.We actually did a thing right before the holidays kicked in. We got off the road and my wife Selena and I and the board members went and handed out some microphones, these signature mics that SC did for me a few years ago, and we wanted to go visit the kids at the schools and hear them sing and realize the foundation — they have guitar class after school now because the foundation helped facilitate that. These programs are starting to slowly blossom in the school districts here and we’re involved with the Spokane Symphony and doing things with them. We want to help so kids can discover that music.I’m at a point in life now where, and I think Mark is there as well, where look, we’ve had this incredible good luck and good fortune and you reach a point where now it’s time to help the next generation out. Do your thing, play your part, move it forward, however you want to articulate that. It’s beyond rewarding. It feels good. Let’s just say that.Do you go in there and say, “You kids, you have real instruments. When I was 14, I was in a church basement playing air instruments (laughs).”Exactly! I was pissing off the entire congregation playing Motley Crue songs with no instruments. I wish I had it. Someone in the church cut out wood instruments from plywood and that was my instrument back then. But it is nice to have real instruments.I laugh so much every time I think about that story. So news recently broke about the passing of legendary guitarist Jeff Beck and you shared on Instagram, “Anytime Jeff Beck’s name came up amongst my guitar playing peers, the word untouchable is used to describe his talent. His approach was nearly impossible to imitate and he was one of the most innovative guitarists to ever play the instrument. Rest in peace, Jeff Beck.” So I’m wondering if you remember the first time you heard Jeff Beck or if there was a particular point in your life where you were into him and you wanted to speak about his influence or legacy.He was the artist that when you would talk with other guitar players, no matter how much they’d achieved, you’d hear them say, “Yeah, that’s the guy.” Because he had such an unorthodox approach that was, I don’t know. He was like a character guitar player. You just knew within a handful of notes, “Yeah, that’s Jeff Beck.” The way he would approach things, his phrasing, was just so unorthodox and beautiful.I discovered Jeff Beck initially back in the mid-‘80s, I was watching MTV with my buddy in his basement, and there was a video he did with Rod Stewart. They reunited and did a version of “People Get Ready,” and I remember just thinking, “Wow, what is that?” Because I was at that point wanting to be a little shredder. I was about how fast, and how many notes, which is cool, but here this guy came on and he was saying more with three notes than most guys could with 300. That was a real important moment for me. I realized that less is more.So I went back and discovered Blow by Blow and the kind of the fusion era, which I really gravitated toward in later years, because I’m kind of a fusion jazz nerd. I kind of hate to admit it. So in the ‘70s he did some really great stuff, Blow by Blow, in particular really highlights that side of him, which I thought was really groovy.Thanks to Alter Bridge's Myles Kennedy for the interview.

Loudwire;Architects Frontman Hits Out at Fans Using Tom Searle's Death to Critique Their Music;'I just can’t believe how low people can be,' says the singer.;"Everyone's a critic! But there are some critiques that go a little too far, and Architects frontman Sam Carter is calling out one particular mode of criticism he feels has crossed a line into being something more hurtful and personal.Speaking to NME, Carter has hit out at those who have used guitarist Tom Searle's death as a way to denigrate what they are doing musically. “You put a song out and people will say, ‘Tom’s rolling in his grave. Tom would be fucking sick if he heard this. Tom would fucking hate what you’re doing. You’re pissing on Tom’s legacy,’” says Carter, commenting on some of the messages he's received. “Because you don’t like a song you think it’s OK to bring up the most traumatizing moment of my entire life; a thing that I’m still in therapy for, a thing that I think about every single day. I’ve cried a lot over it and hurt a lot over it, because I just can’t believe how low people can be.”The singer notes the change in tone of the comments toward the band, noting the supportive environment initially after Searle's death. “Everybody wanted to be proud of us for carrying on. People forget very quickly. They forgot that we are just humans.”As for the decision to pursue something a little lighter in tone musically after Searle's death cast a more serious shadow on their previous release, the vocalist says, “I think it was important for it not to become a genre, almost like grief-core or something. It’s really hard to be on tour and talking about that every night, and [it] coming from a place of complete honesty. [But] Tom wouldn’t want us to be sat in pain constantly and bringing up traumatic experiences every night.”During a recent chat with Loudwire Nights, Carter further elaborated on the decision to make the tonal change. ""It was around ""Animals"" coming out and playing shows around For Those That Wish to Exist. I think the thing with it was [we were] discussing Tom constantly. It's not an easy thing to do 24/7 and to open your trauma up to everybody for that amount of time. It became quite tiring and really just sad,"" he told host Toni Gonzalez.""I think every time we would go onstage, I would tell a story about Tom, but I couldn't just tell the same story. I wouldn't want to do that, because I didn't want it to sound like I was reading a script. So, every night we were talking about Tom I'd be going into the to these traumatic memories and sometimes they're really fond memories and sometimes they were really hard memories,"" he continued. ""But I would be telling the truth. It became a point where I spoke with Dan [Searle, drummer], and Dan had obviously seen that how much it was getting to me discussing this stuff onstage and he was like, 'You don't have to open up as much as you are if you don't want to,' and was like 'If you need to just not say as much and to get through the show and to have a good time and to be grateful that you're here, then you should do that.'""Carter concluded, ""So, yeah, when it came into the studio and to live, as a sailor off the back of For Those That Wish to Exist, it was more like, let's just really enjoy this moment that we have. Let's do what Tom would want us to do, which was to not be sat around being sad and miserable. He would want us to go and live our lives to the fullest and to enjoy every moment, and I think that's what we want.""The band's new album, The Classic Symptoms of a Broken Spirit, is out now.The 45 Best Rock + Metal Albums of 2021These are the 2021 albums we couldn't stop listening to.";2022-10-26;https://loudwire.com/architects-frontman-fans-using-tom-searle-death-critique-music/;2022-10-27;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREARCHITECTSFRONTMANHITSOUTATFANSUSINGTOMSEARLE'SDEATHTOCRITIQUETHEIRMUSIC
Loudwire;30 Years Ago: Pantera Release 'Vulgar Display of Power';Re-spect!;"During the cycle for their well-received major label debut, Cowboys From Hell, Pantera toured with Judas Priest, Exodus, Sepultura, Suicidal Tendencies and Prong. By the time they got back home to Texas in 1991 they were energized by the excitement of playing for appreciative crowds, getting wasted with other bands and rocking different venues every night.After a mere two-week break to decompress, they headed right into Pantego Sound Studio, the facility owned by Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul’s dad, Jerry Abbott, and started jamming. At the time, the band members were on overdrive, realizing they had the opportunity to raise the bar and take their music to – as they called it – another level. The result of their efforts was Vulgar Display of Power, an unrelenting slab of precision riffs and cathartic energy that came out on February 25, 1992.“Vulgar Display of Power was definitely the defining moment of Pantera,” vocalist Philip Anselmo said. “The sound was the absolute stripping away of all the bullshit and letting everything come out emotionally and going for the money right off the bat. Vulgar Display of Power absolutely encapsulated Pantera.”Drummer Vinnie Paul added, “We always knew we were more than a club band and we always knew we were talented musicians and we had the skills to kick it up a notch. We wanted to prove to everybody that we had a little bit more in the gas tank. We were so fired up our mentality was, ‘Just give us the ball and we'll get a touchdown.’”Everyone in the band was gunning to make a heavier, more brutal album than Cowboys From Hell, which contained moments of Judas Priest worship and near-commercial showmanship. But the band had a different idea of how to reach the next plateau of heaviness.Anselmo started listening to more hardcore and emulating the honest, confessional and confrontational quality of the bands in the scene, while bassist Rex Brown heard Metallica’s 'Black Album' and decided he wanted to be the opposite of that.And Vinnie Paul just wanted to hammer the double bass and play the fuck out of his drums. But it was guitarist Dimebag Darrell who streamlined the band’s vision, writing most of the riffs and song structures, which ranged from the slow, simple sludge of “Walk” to the sledgehammer ferocity of “Fucking Hostile.”Pantera, ""Walk"" Music Video“Pantera were totally driven, as driven as anybody could ever be,” recalled Jerry Abbott.“Darrell had his four-track that he slept with. And when they came into the studio, they weren’t fooling around. They’d worked together enough until the four of them were one. They were all prepared and in particular Darrell because he was the main person who put together the basics of their music. And between him and Vinnie, they wrote those tunes as far as the band structure and the music that was played. Phil had the freedom to do whatever he wanted to. It was kind of like the Van Halen thing where Eddie and Alex would go in and lay down the stuff and whatever David Lee [Roth] wanted to do, they didn’t give a crap because they had done their part and they knew he’d do his.”Unlike Cowboys From Hell, which Pantera demoed before recording, most of the songs for Vulgar Display of Power were composed in the studio with producer Terry Date. The exceptions were “A New Level,” “Regular People (Conceit)” and “No Good (Attack the Radical,”“We demoed those before Terry came in because we wanted to get a head start,” Vinnie Paul said. “We had started working on getting the tones and they were pretty good, but when Terry showed up we really just honed it in and got it going. I think one of the most important things for us was creating this special sound that people would know as Pantera. We got real close to it on Cowboys, but we really focused on honing the guitar sound to what it ended up being. And we really focused on the drums being really percussive with a nice attack.”Once Date and the band were content with the tones they had dialed in, they started simultaneously writing and tracking. While Dimebag had already composed some of the riffs, he, the rest of the band and Date acted on impulse, spontaneously combining passages, establishing grooves and relying on intuition to know when something sounded right.It was with that mindset that Pantera created some of their most popular songs, including “Mouth For War,” “A New Level,” and “This Love.” And from that point on, Pantera never demoed another song before they started recording.“We never were a big band on doing preproduction or demos or anything,” Vinnie Paul said. “We always wanted to capture the initial vibe of the song and the only way to ever do that was to do it as we were writing it. A lot of bands would record demos back in the day for everything, but we never wanted to get caught up in the vibe of doing demos and overthinking it and doing it again. We just caught the natural aggression that was there.”Pantera, ""Mouth for War"" Music VideoIn addition to writing from the gut, Pantera fine-tuned everything until it was tighter than a clenched fist. If the tempo on a take wasn’t perfect or if the bass and guitars weren’t exactly in synch they’d keep working on a song until they nailed it.“Dime would always put the guitars down first and then I would put the bass down,” Brown said. “We would sit there for hours and microscope each individual note. Now, this was before you had any ProTools or anything like that. We’d just take all the drums out on the whole thing and listen to every single tone and muted guitar part to make sure the guitars and bass were sitting right on top of one another. That’s why sometimes you don’t hear the bass; it’s just so meshed in with the guitar that it sounds like one giant tone.”As focused as Pantera were when they worked, Dimebag Darrell got bored easily and he dug mischief almost as much as he loved playing the guitar. So inevitably, once Pantera had been working for several hours, shenanigans would ensue.“Man, Dime always had a prank prepared or a joke to pull,” Brown said. “He was nonstop, either to fuck with the other guy or just to get a laugh. There was always something nonsensical about the guy. He’d just finish his parts and then let loose. And he was so funny and entertaining that we couldn’t get mad at him.”“There was all kinds of stuff going on,” Date said. “I remember we had some darts in the studio and one of their buddies was in there barefoot. So we had him stand there and played darts around him. And somehow his foot became a target for the darts. He got hit at least once in the foot with a dart. It was completely hysterical, even to him.“And I remember many of my rental cars getting trashed. Once, Vinnie took his car and drove through a field and a bunch of ditches and it came back completely covered in hay. When I did those records with the guys it was just me. There was no assistants or extra personnel. So it was a lot of work. And the majority of the work from me was trying to keep these guys from straying and having too much fun. So I as constantly going, ‘Okay c’mon, let’s get to work.’ And of course, whenever you do that they take it one step further and do whatever they can to keep the fun going.”In addition to having fun with his bandmates, Anselmo spent many hours laboring over his lyrics. Not only did he want to escape the frivolity that existed in metal at the time, he wanted to scream like his favorite hardcore howlers and write like Henry Rollins. Not that Anselmo imitated Rollins, but his ability to write about the trauma and turmoil in his life without sounding preachy was similarly poetic.“I wanted to sing the truth, as ugly as it was a lot of the time,” he said. “In songs like ‘Hollow’ and ‘This Love’ I wrote about losing people. And I’ve had healthy, healthy doses of it from early in my life — in New Orleans, especially. There was a punk rock band there called Shellshocked that set the bar for the local scene. And in 1987, their guitar player, Mike Hatch — one of my good friends, committed suicide — I had pretty much just moved to Texas. I couldn’t attend his funeral because Pantera was playing. I also had a former high school friend named Roman Petrozza, who had taken his life. I had a friend named Henry Glover, who had taken his life so tragically. He was such a good kid, man. They were all so young. So something like 'This Love' is not a specific song about any one of them. It’s a collective. I think even then, when I was writing it in 1992, I knew that people were going to take the lyrics and make them their own. I tried to make it a heart-throttling gut-wrencher for everyone to relate to.”Pantera, ""This Love"" Music VideoTwo months into the recording process, in September 1991, Pantera were invited to play a show in Russia opening for AC/DC and Metallica. The Monsters of Moscow concert was the first time most Russian artists had been exposed to heavy metal bands from outside their country. The gig couldn’t have come at a better time. Pantera needed a break from the studio and they benefited from the exposure to life outside of Western culture.“The crowd treated us like Led Zeppelin even though most of them had never heard of us,” Vinnie Paul said. “They had only heard Metallica and AC/DC because their music was available on the black market. I remember walking around Red Square and I bought a whole Russian army outfit from some dude for $10. Rubles were worth nothing. It was just ridiculous how poor and corrupt and wrecked the whole country was at that time. They gave us a tent to stay in and a half a bottle of tequila and that’s all we got that day and that was fine with us. We were just so happy just to be there. They made a rock documentary about it called For Those About to Rock, and every time I see it, I just get goosebumps. It was a really a great performance. We were as good as anybody else that played that day.”Pantera flew from Russia to Texas with an ever more acute sense of focus and determination. They were inspired by the reception they had received at Monsters of Moscow and stoked about the music they had already written. They couldn’t wait to bang out more tunes and as soon as they plugged in their musical chemistry was as strong as it had ever been.“The music just bled out of us,” Anselmo said. “At the time, I was on the most positive kicks I’ve ever been on. When I wrote [lyrics] like ‘new level of confidence,’ it was fuckin’ true. I was alive, man.”“Back then, there was never really any arguing,” Brown said. “Our way of arguing was if one guy was down, the other three picked on him to, like, try to boost his morale.”When Pantera finished recording the album, they flew to New York to master the record at Master Disc. The band sequenced the songs and the studio placed them in order on a master tape. Then they sat down and listened to what they had created.“Dime was sitting there on the couch and he was crying all the way through it,” recalled Vinnie Paul. “And I went, ‘Dude, are you all right?’ And he said, ‘It’s perfect. It’s perfect. It’s exactly what I always wanted and always dreamed of. It’s fuckin’ perfect.' It meant so much to him that he became emotional.”Vulgar Display of Power debuted on the Billboard album chart at No. 44. While that’s the highest the album charted, it remained on the charts for 79 weeks. While Pantera’s next album, Far Beyond Driven, would enter at No. 1, the band was thrilled that their second major label release – one which they had worked so hard on and were so proud of – hit Billboard.“I had sat for years in the studio reading Billboard magazine and now to actually see the album chart really blew me away,” Brown said. “Even at 44 – that was unbelievable. It’s just hard to describe how fast and quick it all happened. It really was a dream come true. There was a lot of hard work and all that paid off. All the sacrifices we had to make in our life were all worth it.”While Far Beyond Driven charted higher, Vulgar Display of Power had legs and became Pantera’s biggest album. The record was certified Gold by the RIAA on February 9, 1993 and was a slow, but steady seller. On November 7, 1997 Vulgar Display of Power went Platinum and on July 7, 2004 it went double Platinum.On May 15, 2012, Elektra issued a two-disc deluxe edition to celebrate the album’s 20th anniversary. The first disc was a remastered version of the original along with a previously unreleased cut called “Piss.” The second disc was a DVD that featured five songs from the Pantera’s 1992 Monsters of Rock performance in Reggio Emilia, Italy and videos for “Mouth of War,” “This Love” and “Walk.”“It’s funny because even though everyone looks back at that album as one of our best records, if not our best, it was an album that came out of a really sincere place. We were just so hungry. We were making $150 a week per diem. We weren’t making a paycheck. We were just doing it because we loved music and we had fun jamming together. We were a team. We were brothers. And that’s worth more than anything, man.”Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;Foo Fighters Reveal Star-Studded Guest List for Taylor Hawkins Tribute Shows;See who will join the band in saluting the late drummer.;"UPDATE: The lineup for the Los Angeles edition of the Foo Fighters and Hawkins Family Present Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert has now been revealed as well. Additional details toward the bottom of this post.It's on! Foo Fighters have revealed a pretty impressive guest list for the first of their Taylor Hawkins tribute shows taking place at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 3.The lineup includes (in alphabetical order) Chris Chaney, Stewart Copeland, Liam Gallagher, Omar Hakim, Joshua Homme, Chrissie Hynde, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Brian May, Mark Ronson, Supergrass, Roger Taylor, Rufus Taylor and Wolfgang Van Halen, along with members of Hawkins other band Chevy Metal and a special appearance by comedian Dave Chappelle. And there's a promise of ""many more to be announced.""Tickets for the show will go on sale this Friday (June 17) at 9AM local time, and the benefit charities in the U.K. will be chosen by the Hawkins family and revealed shortly.Upon the announcement of the show, Liam Gallagher, a longtime friend of Hawkins, stated via Twitter, ""It’s an absolute honour to be invited to kick out the jams for Taylor Hawkins won’t let you down brother."" Both Gallagher and tribute show participant Wolfgang Van Halen were among the initial acts paying musical tribute to Hawkins onstage in their respective tours. Gallagher had dedicated the Oasis classic ""Live Forever"" to Hawkins during a show in London, while Van Halen covered Foo Fighters ""My Hero"" with his band Mammoth WVH during a concert in Boston. ""He was a hero to me, a hero to us [pointing to his band], and a hero to countless people, so we feel this is necessary,"" said Van Halen prior to performing the song.Two acts that Hawkins absolutely loved are making their presence felt at the tribute show as Queen's Brian May and Roger Taylor and Rush's Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson will be part of the event. Upon Hawkins' passing, Brian May had shared his frustration over Taylor's death, wishing he could negotiate with death to bring the musician back. Hawkins famously performed the Queen song ""Somebody to Love"" at his final show. Meanwhile, Queen bandmate Roger Taylor dedicated his Officer of the Order of the British Empire honor to Hawkins, stating what a close family friend he was and commenting on the impact that Hawkins had on his son, The Darkness drummer Rufus Taylor, who is also part of the upcoming tribute show.Hawkins also famously inducted Rush into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with fellow presenter Dave Grohl. In an interview with House of Strombo, Lee spoke of how heartbreaking it was to learn of Hawkins death, adding, ""That really broke my heart."" Lee and Lifeson will be part of the tribute show as well.Another big get for this show is Stewart Copeland, The Police drummer who served as one of Hawkins' earliest influences. “My brother handed me a copy of ‘Zenyatta Mondatta,'” Hawkins said in 2019 BBC Interview. “This was 1982. He goes, ‘If you want to be good, you have to play it like this guy.’ My two first major inspirations — probably the two guys that shaped a lot of what I do when I play drums in a rock band — are Roger Taylor and Stewart Copeland.”Copeland told Rolling Stone of Hawkins, “Taylor was a great hang, and there’s a big hole where a lot of laughs used to live,” Copeland said. “When we weren’t goofing off with each other, we were on the phone talking crackpot theories, get-rich-quick schemes, and just general hang bulls***. He was just indefatigably cheerful. He was emotional as well, but that just gave spice to his cheerfulness.”Upon announcing the Hawkins tribute shows, the drummer's wife Alison issued her first public statement since his death thanking fans for their ""outpouring of love"" for the musician, while also adding of the group, “We consider every band member and the extended Foo Fighters team our family.”She went on to add, ""In celebration of his life, it is now up to all of us who loved him most to honor Taylor's legacy and the music he gave us.""In addition to the London show, a second U.S. tribute show date is scheduled for Sept. 27 at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles. There has also been talk of additional dates, but nothing announced as of yet.UPDATE: As stated, the Los Angeles tribute show lineup has now been announced. Foo Fighters will be joined onstage at the Kia Forum on Sept. 27 by Chris Chaney, Stewart Copeland, Miley Cyrus, Omar Hakim, Joshua Homme, Joan Jett, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Brian May, Mark Ronson, Alanis Morissette, Gene Simmons, Nikki Sixx, Chad Smith, Luke Spiller, Roger Taylor, Rufus Taylor, Jon Theodore, Wolfgang Van Halen, Brad Wilk and Pat Wilson along with a special appearance by Chevy Metal, with ""more to be announced.""In this bill, the addition of Morissette is notable as Hawkins was part of her band prior to joining Foo Fighters. Tickets will go on sale this Friday (June 17) at 9AM local time.

Loudwire;20 Years Ago: Immortal Release 'Sons of Northern Darkness';A black metal triumph.;"By late 2001, Immortal had released six scorching albums and undergone several sonic and compositional transformations. As they gathered their tools and weapons to start preparing their seventh album, they were agitated and battle-scarred, but fully prepared or one massive final onslaught before taking a lengthy and overdue break. That strategic barrage came with Sons of Northern Darkness, which Immortal released on Feb. 4, 2002.Suffering from severe tendonitis, original guitarist Demonaz handed all guitar duties for the third album in a row to Abbath, who toiled away to write songs that captured the essence of the band’s black metal sound without repeating what it had previously accomplished. In addition to showcasing blast beats, tremolo guitar and sepulchral vocals, the band integrated a variety of catchy thrash riffs, counter-melodies and even elongated chord patterns that defied the traditional tenets of black metal. While much of “One By One” and “Demonium” whizzed by at the speed of machine gun fire, “Tyrants” was slow and sluggish, emphasizing atmosphere over velocity and “Within the Dark Mind” triumphantly marched and stomped like an army after a successful invasion.“I think that Sons of Northern Darkness has a lot of links to what we have done previously, but also we have gone more back to the eighties, the more basic, thrash stuff,” Abbath told Metalkings.com. “But that's important for us, that's what had inspired us and made us who we are today.”Immortal — Live (2002)Sons of Northern Darkness was Immortal’s third album in a row produced by Hypocrisy and Pain frontman Peter Tägtgren, who had learned how to best capture their sound; the album is, by far, the band’s crispest, most well-defined release. Sons of Northern Darkness also marked Immortal’s first album in a new deal with Nuclear Blast, which granted them greater distribution that Osmose could provide as well as complete creative freedom.“It was time for us to move on and for Osmose to let go,” Abbath said. “Osmose still hasn't got distribution in the United States, for example that explains a lot, doesn't it? Nuclear Blast have been an honest and strong ally.”While Abbath and drummer Horgh wrote many of the songs for Sons of Northern Darkness from scratch, some of the more experimental and thrashy passages had been written for past releases, but didn’t fit the vibe of the music.“Some of the riffs on 'Beyond the North Waves' have been along for quite a while, also some of the riffs on 'In My Kingdom Cold' have been around for a couple of years,” Abbath said. “We haven't got the right ideas or feelings for making those songs until now. And still while working on Sons of Northern Darkness album, I would come up with riffs which I just have to put in the freezer and wait and see if I can fit them into the next album, because you see, I got killer riffs and sometimes they don't fit in.”Abbath on Reality Check TV (2002)It would be a while before Abbath was able to try out the “freezer riffs” with Immortal, if he ever accessed them at all. As much as fans and critics praised the brutality and cohesiveness of Sons of Northern Darkness, a division had grown within the band that couldn’t be mended for years. Bassist Iscariah quit after recording only one track, leaving Abbath to tackle bass in the studio as well as all the vocals and guitar. And while Demonaz provided all of the colorful, imaginative lyrics, his inability to play in the band or tour caused a rift with Abbath.“The band’s spirit was not there,” Abbath told Revolver. Me and Horgh, we were out, we did the studio, we did the music, the touring, everything, and Demonaz only did all the lyrics. He wasn’t that much involved, just the lyrics, and we didn’t have a permanent bass player… We were fed up, especially me. We could have continued and made more money, but that’s not the first issue in this band. Immortal is about the brotherhood; Immortal is a sacred thing, you know, it’s not only for the money?”In mid-2005, Abbath, Demonaz and original Immortal drummer Armagedda got together with Gorgoroth bassist King Ov Hell and Enslaved guitarist Arve Isdal to work on an album for a band they called I. They released the album Between Two Worlds in November 2006 and by the summer of 2007 Immortal were playing reunion shows, which paved the way for their 2009 album All Shall Fall.Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Shadows shared the tale of how a musical present gifted to he and his wife upon the birth of their first child has now turned into the Synyster Gates piano-centric instrumental that closes out their latest album.Get Avenged Sevenfold Tickets HereFirst off, you read that right. The guitarist turns pianist for the album closer, going through years of practicing multiple hours a day in order to accomplish his performance. And given that he had learned on his one specific piano where he felt most comfortable, producer Joe Barresi was then tasked with building a studio around the piano in Gates' home to record the song, per Kerrang!.But about that special present, “Brian wrote it on MIDI – on a programme – for my first son’s birth, so it was 10 years ago, almost 11 years ago,” M. Shadows explains. “And he sent it to me and Val [Matt’s wife], and I fucking loved it. I would listen to it – the MIDI version – every night on headphones.""The singer continued, ""With this record being so weighty and emotional, for the end of it I was imagining The Shining, where Jack Nicholson’s at the bar and he’s talking to the people that had been there before him and they’re all dead. I was thinking of that scene and this one simple piano: just raw, bare piano. And I convinced him that it needed to be on the end of the record.”When asked about the request to turn the song into an actual Avenged Sevenfold composition, Gates says, “I was both deeply honored and deeply concerned!”“I don’t suffer from much embarrassment these days (laughs), but I had a touch of embarrassment because it’s like a ‘look at me’ moment. It kind of fucked me up,"" admits the guitarist. ""I’m so thankful that I had the support to put a fucking meandering piano piece that I wrote and played on an Avenged Sevenfold record. I mean, who could ask for better friends and better bandmates? I can’t express how grateful I am to have that type of support.”READ MORE: We Answer the Most Searched Questions About Avenged SevenfoldYou'll be able to hear the ""Life Is But a Dream"" title track when the new album arrives on June 2.

Loudwire;Sinead O'Connor Dead at 56;Sinead O'Connor has died at the age of 56 in July 2023.;"Sinead O’Connor, the Irish singer best known for her chart-topping hit “Nothing Compares 2 U” has died at the age of 56.According to The Telegraph, it is not known how she died. She had struggled with mental health issues throughout her career, most recently last year after the death of her son.Born Dec. 8, 1966, O’Connor was the third of five children. Raised in a broken home where she allegedly suffered abuse from both parents, the future musician was routinely in trouble as a kid. At 15 years old, she was placed in a church-run asylum. “I will never experience such panic and terror and agony over anything like I did at that place,” the singer would later recall of the traumatic experience. “If you were bad, they sent you upstairs to sleep in the old folks' home. You’re in there in the pitch black, you can smell the shit and the puke and everything, and these old women are moaning in their sleep.”It was during this time that O’Connor began to sing, partly as a way to deal with the intensity of her situation. Her first gig as a teen was singing at a wedding. She enjoyed the experience so much that she became determined to pursue a life of music.The aspiring singer would join a band in Dublin, eventually dropping out of school altogether to chase her dream. Local gigs would catch the attention of music executives who signed O’Connor to her first contract.In 1986, the singer co-wrote the song “Heroine” with the Edge of U2. O’Connor also provided vocals for the track, which featured on the soundtrack to the film Captive.A year later, O’Connor released her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra. The LP garnered worldwide attention and earned the singer her first Grammy nomination. Songs “Mandinka” and ""I Want Your (Hands on Me)"" garnered significant radio airplay, with the latter track earning extra attention after appearing in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. Still, it was O’Connor’s next LP that truly shot her to stardom.In 1990, the singer released I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, the album featuring her massive hit “Nothing Compares 2 U.” The song was originally written by Prince and first put out by the Family in 1985, but received little recognition at that time. In O’Connor’s hands, the angsty power ballad became a worldwide phenomenon. The song hit No. 1 in more than 20 different countries, including four weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.“The song reminded me of my mother, who had died three years previously,” O’Connor later explained of “Nothing Compares 2 U,” a realization she didn’t make until filming the song’s music video. “I made an emotional connection, which I was not expecting — it didn’t hit me when I was recording the song. It only kicked in when I was being filmed. So I was sitting there, thinking about me mother, and trying hard not to bawl my eyes out.""“Nothing Compares 2 U” turned O’Connor into a worldwide superstar, a status that seemingly conflicted with her rebellious nature. In 1992, the singer appeared on Saturday Night Live and made headlines by tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II while performing an a cappella version of Bob Marley’s “War.” “Fight the real enemy,” O’Connor defiantly declared on camera, making a statement against child abuse in the Catholic Church. The act would lead to a firestorm of media coverage, with pundits all over the world weighing in on the controversy.“‘Sinead O’Connor’ was never meant to be a pop star,” she later explained to Today. “I was really a protest singer.” Even though the SNL appearance would haunt O’Connor throughout the rest of her public life, the singer never regretted her actions. ""I'm not sorry I did it. It was brilliant.""Even after the Pope-ripping controversy, O’Connor continued to remain an in-demand songstress. In 1993 she recorded the song ""You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart"" -- written by Bono -- for the soundtrack to the film In the Name of the Father. In 1994, she was one of many special guests to appear on the musical event (and later live album) A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and the Who. Further collaborations over the years would include work with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, Peter Gabriel, Wyclef Jean, Ian Brown and Mary J. Blige.In total, O’Connor released 10 albums between 1987 and 2014, earning one Grammy Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three MTV Video Awards and a Golden Globe nomination in the process. In 2021, the singer announced her retirement from music. “I've gotten older and I'm tired. So it's time for me to hang up my nipple tassels, having truly given my all,” she proclaimed while announcing her final album, No Veteran Dies Alone, would arrive in 2022. She’d later walk back those comments, saying that she still intended to tour.O’Connor dealt with various health issues over her life, including bipolar disorder, addiction and fibromyalgia. The singer had four children and was married four times. On Jan. 8, 2022, her 17-year-old son, Shane, was found dead. Just days afterward, O’Connor checked herself into a hospital, following a series of disturbing tweets. ""I've decided to follow my son. There is no point living without him. Everything I touch, I ruin. I only stayed for him. And now he's gone,"" she wrote.In Memoriam: 2023 DeathsA look at those we've lost.";2023-07-26;https://loudwire.com/sinead-oconnor-dead-at-56/;2023-07-30;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRESINEADO'CONNORDEADAT56
Loudwire;Nooooo! Weird Al Might Never Release Another Parody Song Again;There will probably never be an About Ham Time.;"War still rages in Ukraine. Inflation has made avocados 7 bucks. Elon Musk is chief of Twitter. And if it couldn't get any worse, now we learn this: Weird Al Yankovic says he probably will not release another parody song, ever.We learn this on a day of Weird Al hope and hype, as his biopic Weird: The Al Yankovic Story drops today (Nov. 4) on the Roku channel. Weird Al tells Rolling Stone , ""I’m not so focused on (parody songs...) If a brilliant idea pops in my head, I guess I’d do it. But I’m leaving that to other people for the time being. I’m not retiring. I’m not saying I’m never gonna do another one. But it’s just not my focus right now.”The undisputed king of parody songs, (Weird Al has done more than 150!,) with bangers like as ""My Bologna,"" ""Smells Like Nirvana"" and ""White and Nerdy,"" Weird Al has actually been silent on the new parody front since 2014. On that year's Mandatory Fun album, he took on Lorde's ""Royals"" and turned it into ""Foil"" (like aluminum), turned Pharrell's ""Happy"" into ""Tacky"" and Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" became ""Word Crimes."" Since then he's been the bandleader on Comedy Bang! Bang!, went on four tours, and co-wrote the Weird movie. But no new parody songs. What?!!! The world never got a ""Jello"" from Adele's worldwide smash ""Hello""? Agghhhhhhh!!!!!!!And we'll probably never get one. “I spent decades of my life obsessed with the Billboard charts, and living and breathing musical trends,” says Weird Al. “I’m just taking a little break from that and trying to do other things that I’m interested in. And again, if a great idea strikes me, then certainly I’ll do that. But I don’t want to try to force it just for the sake of feeding the pipeline.”Weird: The Al Yankovic Story movie, starring Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame, does have a new original song in it called ""Now You Know."" Yahoo says it plays over the end credits, putting a bow on the biopic by explaining: ""Now you know all my dirty secrets 'cause we spilled all the tea / There's nothing left to hide baby / How you like the real me?"" The Weird soundtrack also includes ""I Love Rocky Road,"" ""Another One Rides the Bus"" and ""Like a Surgeon,"" all newly recorded for the movie.And Weird Al says although unannounced, there are more live shows in store for 2023, and he has a few things on his plate that he can't talk about yet. But no ""About Ham Time"" (""About Damn Time"" Lizzo) or ""Bad Rabbits"" (""Bad Habits"" Ed Sheeran?)

WILLOWFollow the Best of the Month playlist on Spotify here.STAFF FAVORITESThe stuff Loudwire's team has been obsessed with.Lauryn SchaffnerBAND: The Luka StateSONG: “Bring Us Down”RELEASED: May 18Have you ever heard of fuzz-punk? Or punk-fuzz? I’m not sure if either are officially a thing, but The Luka State’s “Bring Us Down” made it one. The garage-y nature of the track and its angsty lyrics make for a type of distorted anarchy you don’t hear often in rock songs anymore.BAND: Marcus KingSONG: “Rescue Me”RELEASED: May 20I chose Marcus King’s “Hard Working Man” as one of my staff picks last month, and as a result, I started following him more closely. I actually like his latest single “Rescue Me” even more, because it’s swampy but mellow and groovy at the same time. The funky melody of the guitar in the verses actually reminds me a bit of Iron Butterfly’s “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” which is such a classic in its own realm, so kudos to King for capturing such an iconic sound while still making it his own.Toni GonzalezBAND: Classless Act featuring Vince NeilSONG: “Classless Act”RELEASED: May 20Classless Act are about to have the opportunity of a lifetime performing on ""The Stadium Tour"" with huge bands Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett. They just got an extra seal of approval courtesy of Vince Neil who appears on their new song ""Classless Act.” It's not too often a group names a song after their band, so there's that. What really got me curious if I'm being honest is, how does Vince Neil sound? Happy to report that he sounds great on this! As far as the band goes, they are straight up fun rock ‘n’ roll, high energy, a little dirty and very reminiscent of when rock reigned supreme. They are going to be right at home on this tour.BAND: Coheed and CambriaSONG: “Comatose”RELEASED: May 18Coheed and Cambria's new album Vaxis II: A Window of the Waking Mind arrives on June 24, and they've just released another new song from it titled “Comatose.” Claudio Sanchez actually came on Loudwire Nights and spoke to us at length (since I asked) about Coheed’s Amory Wars comic series, but you don't need to have a firm grasp on the ongoing storyline to just appreciate this kickass song. Again, I'll write that he has one of the most unique and identifiable voices in rock and they are having so much fun with these new songs — it's contagious!Philip TrappBAND: Cave InSONG: ""Reckoning""RELEASED: May 10The Cave In of 2022 is a welcome return for the band's longtime fans. The 2018 death of bassist Caleb Scofield — and the seeming swan song that followed, Cave In's Final Transmission — signaled the end of an era for the Massachusetts post-metal act. But from shortly after their 1995 inception, Cave In has made a name for themselves in indie metal by branching out in different, musically progressive directions. That sonic journey is epitomized uniquely on ""Reckoning,"" this month's slow-burning single from Heavy Pendulum, Cave In's seventh album — their first with Converge bassist Nate Newton in Scofield's place.BAND: HundredthSONG: ""Fantasize""RELEASED: May 19Hundredth was once a hardcore band if you can believe it. Then, the punk upstarts from South Carolina began expanding their horizons with shoegaze and indie pop. That pivot, itself now several years ago, placed the cornerstone for Hundedth's latest musical exploits. Still substantial but no longer heavy, the group's newest single, ""Fantasize,"" mines synthpop territory similar to Chvrches or M83. Hundredth singer Chadwick Johnson's vocals remain upfront — his throaty yowl now a shiny coo, smooth and sensual — but they're urgent in a new, unhurried way. ""Fantasize'' is a soothing tune to get lost in, even if you can't mosh to it.Mike SternBAND: StarcrawlerSONG: “Road Kill”RELEASED: May 11New label, new song, new possibilities, that’s the short career update for Los Angeles based Starcrawler. The band recently signed to Big Machine, known for shepherding the careers of artists such as Sheryl Crow and Tim McGraw. They are going on tour in Europe as support for My Chemical Romance, which promises to give big exposure to new audiences. And now they have dropped a new song “Road Kill,” which, according to lead singer Arrow De Wilde, is about anyone who tries to dig in their heels and stand in your way. “Sometimes you just have to run through them,” says De Wilde.BAND: Matt MaesonSONG: ""Blood Runs Red”RELEASED: May 19Like many young artists before him, Matt Maeson has now learned about the impact of three years of constant touring and increasing levels of success. He addresses the topic in his new song “Blood Runs Red,” which he says is about finding yourself at home after the tour. “You’re left with yourself and who you’ve become while everyone else has stayed the same,” says Maeson.Rabab Al-SharifBAND: Joyce ManorSONG: “Don’t Try”RELEASED: May 3You can still count on California melodic punks Joyce Manor to release short and sweet sing-along bangers, and their latest “Don’t Try” is just that. The track is another preview of their impending 40 oz. to Fresno out June 10 on Epitaph. Not a lot of bells and whistles, just a way to lose yourself in your feels, even if it’s only 100 seconds.Chad ChildersBAND: The Afghan WhigsSONG: “The Getaway”RELEASED: May 3Though a band breakup thwarted the momentum of their ‘90s heyday, the Afghan Whigs are becoming the rare band whose second act could possibly be as good as or eclipse their first. Now onto their third studio album since reuniting, singer Greg Dulli and his cohorts continue to create interesting work, already earning a mention in this column for “I’ll Make You See God” earlier this year, and now getting some love for “The Getaway.” Serving up a cautionary warning with hypnotic unease, the Afghan Whigs build to a chilling string-filled climax. You can find both songs on their How Do You Burn? album.BAND: CentershiftSONG: “And So …”RELEASED: May 20Onesidezero seemed to be on the verge of big things in the early 2000s, and now singer Jasan Radford could be primed for the spotlight again with his new band Centershift. The group, also featuring members of Shuvel and Bemus, issued the outstanding track “My Own World” earlier this year, and this time they’ve gone a little darker in focus, delving into the issue of domestic violence. “How could we know?” is a repeated refrain in the song, expressing the angst over an often hidden issue. With bass and drums hurtling the song forward, “And So…” is a solid follow-up single for their newly released A Different Shade EP.BAND: Larkin PoeSONG: “Bad Spell”RELEASED: May 19If you look up swagger in the dictionary this past month, they might have replaced the definition with a simple YouTube video for this song. Written as a female response to the classic Screamin’ Jay Hawkins song “I Put a Spell on You,” Larkin Poe’s Megan Lovell dishes out a guitar sound so nasty it’s bound to elicit more than a few stankface responses. Meanwhile, Rebecca Lovell’s vocal oozes ill intent as she belts, “Boy you cast a bad spell / A bad spell over me / You better beware / You better take care / I’m gonna get you it’s a guarantee.” This standout will be featured on their Blood Harmony album, due Nov. 11.BAND: New MonarchSONG: “The Day You Left”RELEASED: May 12New year, new name, new song. New Monarch (formerly Monarch) appear ready to press ahead with their debut album after introducing themselves last year with a pair of songs. Featuring former members of Red Sun Rising and Wilson, the band finds their sweet spot on “The Day You Left,” perfectly capturing the aggression and resignation of a relationship torn asunder. Alternating between attention-grabbing drum hits and muscular riffs to mournful melodic verses, New Monarch deliver one of their strongest songs to date.BAND: SunsleeperSONG: “Currents”RELEASED: May 11Ever feel like life is a series of ebbs and flows? Utah rockers Sunsleeper know that feeling all too well, using it as inspiration for their song “Currents” that hones in on the agitated feeling of being stuck in a cycle of push and pull, yearning to break free. That said, “Currents” is a song we’re happy to be stuck on, sinking into the lush hypnotic fuzzed out melancholy and giving us a ‘90s-esque jones that we’re so happy to indulge.Joe DiVitaBAND: PsycropticSONG: “Rend Asunder”RELEASED: May 17Aussies Psycroptic have been kickin’ for over 20 years, mainstays of 21st century tech-death and back with Divine Council, their first album in four years and eighth overall. Up first is “Rend Asunder,” which discharges tight, choppy grooves cut with a simple but dizzying guitar lead that gives this track a huge sense of push and pull. David Haley’s drumming is rigid and artfully busy, offering the perfect foundation for the rest to slide around in a way that feels so much less robotic than many of their peers.BAND: BaestSONG: “Creature”RELEASED: May 6Earlier this year, Baest issued “Gargoyles,” which features the now late Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder fame. This next single arrives in a bittersweet fashion and the pangs of loss come flooding back as we’re reminded of the beloved death metal icon who continuously supported new artists in any way he could and was just overall a kind and sweet human being.Seeing Strnad’s support for Baest is what first turned me on to them, so in that spirit, “Creature” gets my vote this May. As brutal as this song is, there’s plenty of classic metal flashes, which seems to be a trend of late, and a trend I wholeheartedly encourage to continue.BAND: Temple of VoidSONG: “Hex, Curse & Conjuration”RELEASED: May 5For fans of Incantation and Hooded Menace, Temple of Void’s death metal and doom cocktail is not best shaken nor stirred, but churned. That’s right, “Hex, Curse & Conjuration” is all about that groove with simplicity serving as high art, countered by downbeat death metal barrages that set up ideal time signature changes to go right back into those side-to-side headbang inducing passages.Todd FooksBAND: Billy HowerdelSONG: “Free and Weightless”RELEASED: May 12A Perfect Circle’s co-founder says his new record to come June 10 is a “patchwork… nothing stands alone.” And that, “Thematically, everything on this record is pointed at personal relationships. The songs are a combination of a few conversations happening in a split-screen point-of-view.” “Free and Weightless,” sounding a bit like mid-stream Depeche Mode, seems to be about a desire to be unencumbered by guilt, responsibility and perhaps dominated. It’s pretty rad, can’t wait for the rest of the quilt.BAND: PolyphiaSONG: “Playing God”RELEASED: May 10Whether it’s the electric slide, 6-string shred, or grinned-n-picked, you can have your face melted. Put on Polyphia’s latest single, “Playing God,” and get your mug molten five ways before it’s time for the main course.Where 20 Rock + Metal Band Names Come FromSolving the mysteries behind the monikers.";2022-06-01;https://loudwire.com/best-rock-metal-songs-may-2022/;2022-06-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREBESTROCK+METALSONGSOFMAY-STAFFPICKS+ESSENTIALS

Eventually, at least one member might just feel the need to end things and move on.As the following 10 picks prove, not even the greatest acts are immune from such consequences.

Loudwire;10 Killer Death Metal Covers of Slayer Songs;Slayer, only even more brutal!;"Here are 10 totally killer death metal covers of Slayer songs.Where would metal be without Slayer? More specifically, what about extreme metal?Easily the most extreme of thrash's 'Big 4,' Slayer not only helped pioneer musical brutality, but lyrical brutality as well. Vivid expressions of humanity at its worst came to be their calling card after graduating from the Satanic/occult/horror aspects of their earlier works, the ideal complement to Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's pounding rhythms and erratic, unhinged solos.READ MORE: The Best Death Metal Album of Each Year Since 1985Slayer's 1986 masterpiece Reign in Blood, in many ways, served as a prototype for what would later become death metal, as countless boundary challengers latched on to the chunkier rhythmic style and the controlled chaos of Dave Lombardo's drumming. Of course, peers such as Possessed and the infancy states of other death metal lynchpins Death, Morbid Angel, etc. were also permeating the underground metal scene at this time.Below, 10 death metal acts pay their respects to Slayer with some blistering covers.Monstrosity, “Angel of Death”Monstrosity's first record without George ""Corpsegrinder"" Fisher remarkably saw the band no worse for the wear without his services as he jumped ship to front Cannibal Corpse.Capping off the band's 1999 record In Dark Purity, a genuinely overlooked death metal affair, is a daring cover of Slayer's infamous ""Angel of Death.""It's a faithful recreation with Araya's visceral scream replaced by deep gutturals, kind of like how Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel needed an amp that goes to 11 to achieve that extra edge.Vader, “Raining Blood”Another elite cover here as Polish brutes Vader tackle the other most iconic song in the Slayer catalog — ""Raining Blood.""The band has actually covered a couple other Slayer tracks — ""Hell Awaits,"" ""Silent Scream"" — but there's no question that the fact that they added a new level of brutality to a track that largely helped shape the death metal genre is worthy of the nod in this list.Vader have always sounded equally calculated and mechanized as they are groovy, giving this cover an ideal amount of push and pull.Decapitated, “Mandatory Suicide”If you think the material on South of Heaven is a bit too slow, then Decapitated's cover of ""Mandatory Suicide"" should suit you nicely.This take on the Slayer classic appears on the tech-death group's 2000 debut, Winds of Creation, which was released when the principle members were teenagers. Despite their young age, their musical proficiency was more than up to (pardon the pun) speed.Frozen Soul, ""Mandatory Suicide""Another cover of ""Mandatory Suicide?"" Yup! Is it excessive? Nope!Texas' enemy of the heat, Frozen Soul, are one of the most exciting new bands to crop up in recent years, playing self-described Cold School Death Metal. Their style is more akin to Bolt Thrower and they bring their glacial approach to riffing to the already doomy opening of ""Mandatory Suicide"" and keep it low and slow with a runtime that exceeds the original by 17 seconds.Mandatory listening.Children of Bodom, “Silent Scream”Bodom's intensely melodic brand of metal is a harsh contrast to Slayer's commitment to evil and aggression, which is what makes their brilliant take on ""Silent Scream"" such a winner.As much as Children of Bodom's style is predicated on flashy, '80s-inspired guitar playing, dueling guitar and keyboard solos as well as harmonized leads, let's not lose sight of the extremity that is an equal part of the sound.Hearing a clinical take on Slayer's typically chaotic solos is worth the listen alone!Revocation, ""Altar of Sacrifice""On Great Is Our Sin, Revocation discarded a lot of the thrashier elements that had pervaded their earlier sound, but they did not forget where they, in part, come from.A cover of the Reign in Blood highlight ""Altar of Sacrifice"" closes out this platter of brutality with Dave Davidson discharging his totally mean mid-range grunt.At the Gates, “Captor of Sin”How did we ever get so lucky? Not only did At the Gates unleash the game-changing Slaughter of the Soul in 1995, it's from the same recording sessions that their cover of ""Captor of Sin"" was tracked.The song originally appeared on Slayer's cult favorite Haunting the Chapel EP, opening with wailing, screeching guitar leads, and it sounds even more raw when At the Gates do it, despite the rest of the record being a rather polished effort.And who could ever pass up hearing Tomas Lindberg's soul-searing, feral vocal wretch on this Slayer standout?Hypocrisy, “Black Magic”There's a seriously special quality to Slayer's 1983 debut, Show No Mercy. Not bashful about their NWOBHM influences, the record takes us back to that halcyon era where you could literally hear the sound of thrash taking shape.Many will contend that ""Black Magic"" is the high point of this record and Sweden's Hypocrisy are not impervious to the track's spellbinding charm.So it's pretty cool hearing a death metal take on a song that's, in part, classic metal. After all, that's the DNA of Sweden's influential melodic death metal scene!Cephalic Carnage, “Jesus Saves”Death-grinder Cephalic Carnage contributed their version of ""Jesus Saves"" to the Gateway to Hell 2 Slayer tribute album, and it's the most unique rendition of anything else here.The band has a penchant for off-kilter songwriting quirks and they apply that to this Reign in Blood favorite. There's so many deviations from the original, and every 10-15 seconds feels like a surprise.Yattering, “Dittohead”The third and final Polish death metal band to appear in this list, here's Yattering's take on the Divine Intervention cut ""Dittohead.""It's one of the most intense songs Slayer ever crafted, making it a prime selection for Yattering, who raise the stakes with a short burst of blast beats.Slayer Songs Ranked";2023-04-07;https://loudwire.com/best-death-metal-covers-slayer-songs/;2023-04-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE10KILLERDEATHMETALCOVERSOFSLAYERSONGS
Loudwire;See Footage From Bad Wolves' First Concert With New Singer D.L.;They kicked off their run with Papa Roach and Hollywood Undead.;"Bad Wolves first announced that Daniel ""DL"" Laskiewicz was their new vocalist last June. They've since released an album called Dear Monsters, and last night (March 1), they played their first concert with him on vocals, which you can see footage of below.The show was the kickoff for Papa Roach's Kill the Noise tour, which in addition to Bad Wolves, features support from Hollywood Undead. It took place at the House of Blues in Anaheim, Calif., and also served as Bad Wolves' first performance since February of 2020.According to Setlist.fm, they played an 8-song set, half of which were from Dear Monsters, and the other half from the Tommy Vext era of the band. See a fan-filmed video of the band performing their notable cover of The Cranberries' ""Zombie"" below.Vext and Bad Wolves parted ways in early 2021, and a few months later, the vocalist sued Better Noise Music head Allen Kovac for allegedly plotting a conspiracy to oust him from the band.""Tommy quit Bad Wolves in January 2021 after being abusive to his band members, and he has since waged an all-out assault against the band and its members on social media,"" Kovac said of the matter. ""Behind the scenes, he and his team of lawyers have been trying to extort the band and the record company for a big payout.""A few weeks prior to the release of Dear Monsters, D.L. told Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez that he hoped the band's fans would be open-minded toward his new role in the band.""There's gonna be fans that really enjoy the former singer's stuff a lot more, there may be some people that really enjoy me more and then there's gonna be the people that just fall in between, just walk that tight-rope,"" he explained. ""I think as a band, all we can hope is that the Bad Wolves fans — past, present and future — can just be open-minded to my addition... We've definitely stayed true to the spirit of the band and their sound.

Loudwire;Five Finger Death Punch Drop New Song 'Welcome to the Circus,' Set New Mainstream Rock Chart-Topper Mark;We're about two months from the release of 'Afterlife.';"UPDATE: Five Finger Death Punch have also set a new mark for most consecutive Mainstream Rock airplay chart-toppers with the single ""Afterlife,"" per Billboard. This would be their eighth consecutive No. 1.As the release date of their upcoming album Afterlife approaches, Five Finger Death Punch have dropped another new song from it called ""Welcome to the Circus"" and an accompanying visualizer video. It's the third song they've unveiled from the record, following the title track and ""I.O.U.""""Welcome to the Circus"" serves as the opening track on the album, which will be out Aug. 19 via Better Noise Music. It's the first and only Afterlife song that the rockers have played live, as they debuted it last month at the Welcome to Rockville festival in Daytona, according to Setlist.fm.Check out the song and its lyrics below.Guitarist Zoltan Bathory recently explained why the band decided to name the album Afterlife in an interview with Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez.""The reason we called it Afterlife, Ivan [Moody] and I share a couple of experiences that, generally are private things people don't really talk about, but we both had near-death experiences being on the other side,"" the guitarist said.""Ivan generally writes very personal lyrics anyway, if you read his lyrics from [The Way of the Fist], he's an open book, it's his life and his experiences. So everything is very personal, nothing is fictional. We're not talking about mythology or historical events really, it's all real and actual events and actual feelings that he has.""Afterlife serves as the band's first record since their 2019 release F8. The self-titled track, which the group unveiled back in April, became their 13th No. 1 single this week. A variety of editions of the album are available for purchase — pre-order your copy here now.Five Finger Death Punch will hit the road in the U.S. in support of Afterlife this summer with Megadeth, The Hu and Fire From the Gods.

Loudwire;Florida Man Shreds National Anthem at NFL Game + We Think That’s Why the Jaguars Got to the Playoffs;Watch this killer version of the National Anthem.;"A local Florida guitarist shredded the National Anthem before the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans kicked off their last regular season game on Jan. 7. The performance was so riveting that we even suspect it offered enough of a jolt to the home team Jaguars as they went on to win the game and gain entry into the playoffs.The game between the AFC South division rivals was an especially important one as the winner of the week 18 tilt would be guaranteed a spot in the postseason with a chance to potentially compete for a Super Bowl title.Paul Wane, a Jacksonville resident, set the tone for the night, appearing on the field in a Jaguars jersey, blue jeans and sunglasses, playing the ""Star Spangled Banner"" on a guitar emblazoned with the American flag on the body.The guitarist, who plays in the southern rock/blues band Duval County Line and is behind the Guitars 4 Kids charity that gifts children with musical instruments, noodled his way through melodic leads, utilizing hammer-ons as accents while also liberally making use of the wah pedal at his feet to really play up the dramatic moments. The stadium roared with support and the game was soon underway.Watch Wane's shred-tasting rendition of the National Anthem further down the page and learn more about him at his website.At halftime, the Titans led by a score of 10-7 and the game remained tightly contested until the fourth quarter when a strip sack of Tennessee quarterback Josh Dobbs by Jaguars safety Rayshawn Jenkins led to a fumble recovery for a touchdown by Jaguars linebacker Josh Allen. The go-ahead score put the Jaguars up 20-16, which was good enough for the victory, sending second-year quarterback Trevor Lawrence and head coach Doug Pederson (in his first season with the Jags) to the playoffs where they will now face off against the Los Angeles Chargers on Jan. 14.Again, although we have absolutely no way to tell for sure, we'd like to think that Wane's powerful opening guitar salvo gave the Jaguars all the inspiration and motivation they needed to get to the postseason.Florida Guitarist Paul Wane Plays National Anthem Before Jaguars vs. Titans Game30 Most Underrated Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists16 Most Expensive Guitars of All Time";2023-01-11;https://loudwire.com/paul-wane-national-anthem-guitar-nfl-jaguars-titans/;2023-01-11;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREFLORIDAMANSHREDSNATIONALANTHEMATNFLGAME+WETHINKTHAT’SWHYTHEJAGUARSGOTTOTHEPLAYOFFS
Loudwire;Sabaton to Fire 25-Pounder Gun After Helping Save WWI Museum;The band was invited after raising significant donations for the museum.;"Sabaton has been invited to fire the Ordnance Quick Firing 25-pounder, a gun from WWII after helping save a museum from closing. The Swedish metal band, who have long worn their fascination with the conflicts of the world on their sleeves, is making the trip to the Heugh Battery Museum in England in early March.When the band found out the Heugh Battery Museum was in danger of permanently closing due to a lack of funding, they helped raise funds by selling a specially designed T-shirt to make sure it didn't.The Swedish band is now going to visit the British Museum on March 3 and has been invited to do something extremely special during their visit - shoot the Ordnance Quick Firing 25-pounder. The historic gun is an original British field gun from WWII and is only used on special occasions.Guitarist Chris Rörland, who's a Swedish army veteran who served in the A9 Artillery Regiment, will be firing the gun. The Sabaton band member will be the first-ever non-British army veteran to fire the historic gun.The Heugh Battery Museum stands on the site of the only First World War Battlefield in the U.K..The museum's manager, Diane Stephens, said (as reported by Blabbermouth), ""Sabaton have been a huge support to us in our fundraising efforts and for that we hope to show our gratitude. We really believe that their music brings history to a wide audience who then become visitors to the museums of the world - so they support many museums, not just us.""She went on to say that ""being invited to fire our gun is a gesture of our appreciation of the band and their attitude to keeping history in the mind of those who may not otherwise engage with these momentous historic events and figures.""The museum opened in 2008 and relies on funding from donations, like the one it received from Sabaton, admissions and profits from its cafe.

Loudwire;Dave Grohl Recorded Drums for New Foo Fighters Album;Back behind the kit!;"While we now know that Josh Freese is the touring drummer for Foo Fighters, one other bit of info to come from the Foo Fighters Preparing Music for Concerts livestream was that Dave Grohl is to credit for the drum work on the band's new album, But Here We Are.Though two songs had been released prior to the livestream, official credits for who played what on the tracks had not been revealed. While there had been some speculation that Grohl, who famously played drums for Nirvana and recorded all the music for Foo Fighters' debut album before putting together a full-fledged band, had taken up the drums again, nothing had been confirmed.Get Foo Fighters TicketsBut during the performance from 606 Studios, there was a moment where Grohl and the well-received Freese conversed about the drums on a newly debuted song called ""Nothing at All."" Freese said to Grohl, “When you explained the beat on the record and you’re like, ‘I think I played it with one hand,’ and I’m kinda doing the same thing. It feels good and sounds cool, you know?”“It was unintentional,” Grohl responded. “I did it when I demoed it at my house, and I’d just woken up and I was tired. But on the shitty drum set at my house, it just kinda sounded better. You’re not hitting the hi-hat and the snare at the same time, so it sort of has more space.”Foo Fighters Debut New Song, ""Nothing at All""Grohl had pretty much ceded the drum throne to Taylor Hawkins upon the drummer's arrival in the band, last taking a drum credit on the Hawkins'-led song ""Cold Day in the Sun"" from the 2005 In Your Honor album. Grohl was credited with drums on the band's self-titled debut as well as the 1997 follow-up The Colour and the Shape.

Loudwire;The New Nu-Metal Band Elton John Thinks Are ‘Phenomenal’;Sir Elton John is still paying attention to new music.;"Elton John has tons of love for rock and metal, especially in recent years where he's heaped praise unto the likes of Metallica and Greta Van Fleet, as well as guesting on an Ozzy Osbourne album. But nu-metal? Yes, he's got his ears to the ground there too, professing how ""phenomenal"" he thinks relative nu-metal newcomers Nova Twins are in a new interview about the U.K. iconic Glastonbury festival.The musical legend will make his debut at the fest on June 25, which also marks his last-ever performance in Britain. In advance of the appearance, he spoke with BBC's Clara Amfo about one act in particular he's incredibly excited to see take the stage.""I've watched Glastonbury on the TV and the thing that I love about Glastonbury is not the headliners, per se, it's the people on the smaller stages that they give the chance to shine,"" he says, still enamored with buzzworthy new music at the age of 76.Why Elton John Loves Nova Twins“These girls rock my world,"" John says in the interview clip seen below (shared by Nova Twins), holding up a copy of last year's Supernova album.“I’ve had them on the show, I’ve played their music. So wonderful, what they’re doing. I’m so looking forward to seeing them live because you can feel what it’s going to be like. These girls could light up Sheffield. They are just phenomenal, the way their videos look. They remind me of Rick James a bit, Larry Graham of Central Station, Sly and the Family Stone, Bootsy Collins…,"" John explains, hyping up the nu-metal/alternative duo who have been on an upward trajectory since releasing their debut record Who Are the Girls? in 2020.""Nova Twins, I love you to death and they’re going to storm Glastonbury,"" John enthuses, putting other acts on notice when he adds, ""If they come on stage and it’s a sunny day, they could steal the whole thing.”Thrilled to receive such high praise from a legend such as Sir Elton John, Nova Twins write on Instagram, ""When you switch on the TV and THE @eltonjohn is holding up our album Supernova!! 😳😳💫 Huge love to Elton for picking us as one of his top 4 @glastofest ones to watch and of course @claraamfo for her endless love.""READ MORE: Nova Twins Play Their Favorite RiffsMore About Nova TwinsNova Twins formed in London in 2014 by Amy Love (lead vocals, guitar) and Georgia South (bass, keyboards, backing vocals) and issued three EPs (Nova Twins, Thelma and Louise, Mood Swings) before their first full length arrived in 2020.Although the nu-metal tag certainly applies to their sound, this isn't the nu-metal of old. A lot of different types of rap and hip-hop now permeate the new wave of nu-metal (nu-wave?), which has helped breathe new life (nu-life? Sorry, we'll stop now) into the subgenre.Nova Twins are highly skilled in genre-mashing, offering less of a cut/paste style and, instead, effectively meld beat-based music, alternative and punk to create a genuinely unique hybrid.Take a listen to ""Antagonist"" off Supernova below.Nova Twins, ""Antagonist"" Music Video50 Best Rock + Metal Songs of 2022Out of thousands of new rock and metal songs, these are 50 best.";2023-06-21;https://loudwire.com/elton-john-calls-nova-twins-phenomenal-glastonbury/;2023-06-21;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETHENEWNU-METALBANDELTONJOHNTHINKSARE‘PHENOMENAL’
Loudwire;What the Duck - How to Get Your Phone to Stop Autocorrecting 'F--k';Fend the duck off once and for all.;"We've all been there — you're in the middle of a heated conversation and you're trying to write a certain bad word, when your phone changes it to ""ducking,"" a word much less-commonly used than the one we intended to write. So, here's how to get your phone to stop autocorrecting the word ""fuck.""There's more than one method to fending off the ""duck"" once and for all. The first one is to simply go in through your phone's settings and manually change the keyword so that it isn't autocorrected — this method has pretty much always existed, but because of a certain tweet we recently saw, we know that there are people who are unaware of it. The tweet in question is also how we discovered the second strategy.You may be wondering why the duck we're writing an article about this. To be blunt, the rock and metal community swear a lot, so we know the majority of you have probably come across this problem at one point or another. While a 2015 MusixMatch study revealed that hip hop contains more curse words than any other genre, metal was a close second. A word cloud that a  fan created back in 2019 showed that ""fuck,"" ""shit"" and ""hell"" were among the most-commonly used words in Slipknot's lyrics, so we specifically have our eyes on you, Maggots.Keep reading to learn the details about the different autocorrect-fighting strategies. We should note that these methods are meant for the iPhone.Method 1 - Turn Autocorrect OffThis is pretty straightforward. Go into your phone's settings, then tap ""General"" and then ""Keyboard."" If the button next to Autocorrect is green, then it's on. Tap it to turn it off, and you'll be able to type ""fuck"" all you want. Although, it's important to note that this shuts off the feature completely, so any other spelling errors will be left for you to fix on your own whenever you type.Method 2 - Adjust It in Text ReplacementMethod No. 2 has been around as long as autocorrect has. You'll once again go into your settings and then tap ""General"" and then ""Keyboard."" One of the options at the top is called ""Text Replacement,"" so you'll tap that and then be brought to another page. Here, you can edit and add different phrases that you want autocorrect to implement — so for example, ""omw"" is a standard Apple acronym for ""On my way!"" Whenever you type those three letters, your phone will change it to the phrase, unless you press the little ""x"" when the suggestion pops up.In order to change ""duck"" to fuck,"" add the word duck to ""Phrase"" and then ""fuck"" to shortcut. This works for both words' ""ing"" counterparts as well, but with this strategy, it may be frustrating when you're actually trying to talk about a duck.Method 3 - Add the Word As a ContactAlas — we've come to the latest technique. Here, you'd simply add the word ""fuck"" as a contact in your phone, and then it will stop attempting to autocorrect the word to duck. It probably works for all the other cuss words as well, so go ahead and fill your contacts with number-less entries to your heart's desire. We've tried it, and it works.15 Rock + Metal Bands Banned by Disney";2022-10-04;https://loudwire.com/how-get-iphone-stop-autocorrecting-fuck-duck/;2022-10-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWHATTHEDUCK-HOWTOGETYOURPHONETOSTOPAUTOCORRECTING'F--K'
Loudwire;Why Metallica's Kirk Hammett Loves Using a Wah Pedal - 'I Don't Care What Anyone F--king Says';Kirk defends another signature aspect of his playing style.;"Perhaps no guitarist in metal is more renowned for their use of a wah pedal than Metallica's Kirk Hammett and in a recent interview with Guitar World, the veteran six-stringer opened up on why he loves using this particular effects pedal so much, getting a bit defensive along the way.Despite being Metallica's lead guitarist for four decades, Hammett's playing comes under constant scrutiny, as does just about every aspect of the band and its individual members. The group is under the microscope like no other, something that just comes with the territory when you're one of the biggest bands to ever step on a stage in music history.Get Metallica TicketsAlready this year, the 60-year-old musician has had to defend his solo on the lead 72 Seasons single ""Lux Aeterna,"" poking holes in his detractors' arguments, which garnered an additional response from a YouTuber who wrote his own ""improved"" solo for that track.Now, he reveals what he loves most about the wah pedal, a tool that has become as synonymous with his playing as his use of pentatonic scales.""The wah enables me to mirror the inner voice in my head and in my heart,"" he explains to Guitar World, ""That’s what I’m hearing — all these manipulated notes and tones, because that’s what the human voice is like. We cycle through all these different tones and frequencies when we speak. When I step on that wah pedal and hear that click... well, I’m hearing that clicking in my brain and in my heart at the same time.""In his previous defense of his ""Lux Aeterna"" solo in an interview with Total Guitar, Hammett mentioned a specific aim he has when crafting his guitar solos. ""What’s more appropriate is coming up with melodies that are more like vocal melodies. And guess what? The best scale for mimicking vocal melodies is the pentatonic,"" he said.This notion feeds right into his use of the wah pedal, using it to help mirror voice and melody.Aware of how much he's known to favor the wah, Hammett also tells Guitar World that he ""can’t think of anybody who uses the wah pedal as much as I do.""And if you don't like it, well, too bad! That doesn't bother Hammett.""I don’t care what anyone fuckin’ says. If I feel like stepping on the wah pedal, I step on the fuckin’ wah pedal, because it brings me closer to what I’m hearing internally. And that’s the whole point of gear – to help bring the thing you hear internally out into the external world,"" the guitarist argues.READ MORE: Metallica Lawyer Explains Why Band Was Right to Sue Napster Over Illegal DownloadingBack in 2018, Hammett recollected with Metal Hammer the song that inspired him to use the wah pedal in the first place.""[Jimi] Hendrix wasn’t actually the first person I heard use a wah-wah pedal – that was Brian Robertson from Thin Lizzy! The first time I became aware of it was the song 'Warriors' on Jailbreak,"" he revealed, ""He comes in with this totally wah-ed out two-three notes, and I said to my friend, ‘What is that?!’ He said, ‘That’s a wah-wah pedal.’ ‘Wow, fantastic!’ I made a mental note of that…""You can catch Kirk Hammett and his beloved wah pedal in action this year and next on Metallica's worldwide M72 tour, which kicks off today (April 27) in Amsterdam.

Loudwire;How Did Five Finger Death Punch Get Their Band Name?;How'd they come up with it? Where'd it come from?;"How did Five Finger Death Punch come up with their band name? Where did it come from?Because the heavy metal outfit that formed in Las Vegas in 2005 has a band name that undoubtedly draws a reaction, even if it's a negative one.But don't worry, hating on the Five Finger Death Punch band name doesn't bother the group that includes guitarist Zoltan Bathory and lead vocalist Ivan Moody. In fact, they baked those reactions into the band name when they came up with it, as Bathory has explained in the past.But first, a little background.READ MORE: The Rock Bands With No Original Members Left, or Ones That Never Changed AllHow Did Five Finger Death Punch Get Their Band Name?The band name Five Finger Death Punch, while perhaps sounding outlandish on the face of it to some, draws its inspiration from an entirely earnest source — martial arts cinema.A fascination with the action subgenre threads through the band's albums and artwork, as American Songwriter pointed out. Of course, the deep love of action films is no surprise when you consider Bathory has a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.The Touch of DeathThe ""Touch of Death"" — the legendary martial arts skill purported to kill with seemingly less-than-lethal force — is portrayed in numerous martial arts films. In Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004), Clan of the White Lotus (1980) and Executioners of Shaolin (1977), it's the ""Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique"" — containing five points, or fingers, of death.And quite literally, the Hong Kong film King Boxer (1972) was released in the U.S. as Five Fingers of Death, giving you more than an idea of how Five Finger Death Punch concocted their name.But perhaps more than anything, the band named themselves Five Finger Death Punch because of the impact it carries. It has an effect, and whether a good or bad result, it leaves an impression.Bathory Explains the Name's Impact""The name of the band has to have some kind of an effect,"" Bathory mused in a 2019 studio video. ""It doesn't have to be positive — it doesn't have to be like, 'That's the greatest name in the world!' It can be, 'Oh my God, that's the dumbest fucking shit I ever heard!' Equally good, because it got a reaction.""Zoltan Bathory Comments on Five Finger Death Punch's Band NameHe continued, with Moody concurring, ""I don't think you can beat Five Finger Death Punch, that's probably the worst fucking name. … We almost changed it, and Ivan came in and said, 'That's the best name ever! … They're gonna hate it. Keep it!'""Not a bad idea, after all, because the name has served the band more than well. As Bathory suggested, if you're a rock and metal listener, you probably already have a steadfast opinion one way or the other concerning Five Finger Death Punch — their band, their band name, and their music.Has it left an impact on you?Five Fingers of Death TrailerRock Music Myths + Urban Legends That Were DebunkedWhat's your favorite rock music myth or urban legend that you picked up by word of mouth?

Loudwire;41 Rock Albums That Totally Remind Me of Summer - A Writer's Reflection;Let those memories flow back on a summer breeze.;Summer’s here, and that means great times for some great tunes! Perhaps it’s just the combination of wonderful weather, more free time and the seemingly always available friends around that put you in an environment to make more memories through music. So with that in mind, it’s time to reflect on many of the summers’ past, taking a glance at the albums that will always take us back to sunny days, starry nights and warm breezes.Were you that kid blasting Guns N' Roses out of your boombox during baseball practice? Did Smashing Pumpkins make you think that today really was the greatest? Were you that person singing along at the top of your lungs to Linkin Park without a care in the world? Or was Jimmy Eat World soundtracking your road trip our to the lake?But before we get into this reflection, let’s set some parameters. The pool of possibilities for this list is narrowed by rock albums that were released during summer (June 21-Sept. 22). And while some of these albums may not have been released until the tail end of summer, their singles likely kept us rocking for months in advance of the album’s release.Also, this should not be viewed as a “best of” list. The goal here is to simply spark your own trip back down memory lane through my own reflections and hopefully get you in the summer mood. So whether you were rocking a boombox, turntable, car stereo player or streaming your music, kick back and let the sun shine in as we look at 41 years of summer rock album memories.

In the ensuing two decades, Black Stone Cherry have released seven studio albums, their most recent being 2020's The Human Condition. The band has hit Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart 17 times, reaching No. 10 with their 2011 single ""In My Blood.""

However, being recognized by your peers, community, and home state is BEYOND rewarding. It means so much to us. Our exhibit will be open until Feb. 2023!

You can check out the full conversation below.When asked by Tone-Talk if there are any guitarists he would like to work with, Brown responded (as transcribed by Blabbermouth), ""I did a record —it's not out yet— I did it with Richie Faulkner. Richie and I have become really good friends. And it's really progressively heavy and cool. Richie is a very melodic player, and then it's got my drummer that played on my first solo record. They tracked him playing on one of those electronic kits, and they sampled the sounds into a real kit— which I'm not too crazy about; that's not the way I would do it. But it's Richie's record. And he's got a new singer now. I don't know when that's coming out. Those guys [Judas Priest] are still touring. That was a real thrill.""Brown previously hinted at the collaboration with Faulkner with Antihero. He called the tracks ""badass."" At the time, he didn't say who the collaborator was, hinting, ""He moved to Nashville and became a very, very good friend of mine. And we just cut six blazing fucking tracks.

Loudwire;Wes Scantlin Arrested for Trespassing at Former Home - Report;The occupant of the house even filmed a video.;"Puddle of Mudd's Wes Scantlin was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department on Monday (Feb. 20) after reportedly trespassing at one of his former homes, now owned by another individual who captured the moment on video and shared it on TikTok.The news was first reported by RadarOnline.com, who cited the alleged criminal trespassing and records on the Inmate Information Center for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shows that Scantlin was indeed taken into custody at 12:33PM for a misdemeanor violation on Monday.On TikTok, Ann McFerran, founder and CEO of the Glamnetic beauty brand, shared a video showing a black Hummer vehicle parked diagonally in front of a garage at her home with an obscured occupant inside.Text laid over the video reads, ""When you walk down your driveway to catch an Uber and find a stranger camped outside and then realize it's a famous rock singer who had his house foreclosed on (and has been arrested several times before) and was coming back to claim the house so you have to call the police [because] he begins to threaten the maid you hired and then he gets arrested [because it] turns out he has an active order against him.""Scantlin, of course, has an extensive arrest record, including a 2016 incident where he was arrested for vandalism after doing damage to the property and on-site surveillance equipment at a former home of his that had been foreclosed on.""Okay, there's some random ass dude on my driveway right now [chortles]. Sir, why are you parked on my driveway? That's really weird,"" says McFerran while filming.The vehicle appears to be the same make and model as the one Scantlin possessed when involved in a hit-and-run incident in 2013, as seen here and reported by TMZ. Two notable differences between the 2013 image of the Hummer and the one in the TikTok video above are the small grill in the front and the addition of a front license plate in the current day.The Inmate Information Center also indicates that Scantlin was first held on $1,000 bond and then released on his own recognizance with expectations to appear in court on March 13 at 8:30AM.60 Infamous Rock Star Mugshots";2023-02-23;https://loudwire.com/puddle-of-mudd-wes-scantlin-arrested-trespassing-2023-report/;2023-02-26;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWESSCANTLINARRESTEDFORTRESPASSINGATFORMERHOME-REPORT
Loudwire;Gene Simmons Explains Why He Once Gave Geddy Lee a Bass Lesson;The KISS bassist taught Lee an impromptu lesson early in their career.;"Rush's Geddy Lee is considered one of the greats in music, but as Gene Simmons revealed during a recent chat with Ultimate-Guitar.com, not everyone approaches music in the same manner. If fact, Simmons says he once offered an impromptu lesson to Lee upon learning they were not on the same page during a jam session after a show.In speaking as part of a larger discussion about how to teach people to play as someone who himself admits he can't read or write music, Simmons started discussing some of the legends who weren't able to either, such as John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Rich. That's when his attention turned to sharing the Geddy Lee anecdote.""I'll tell you a telling story. KISS took out Rush on their first tour,"" recalled Simmons. ""They came out to support us, you know, because we liked what they did. And this was in the, in their 'Working Man' period, when they sounded kind of like a Canadian Zeppelin, which I still prefer, sound-wise, but obviously, they've done very well, and we used to hang out with the guys and joke around everything.""""One night back at the hotel or backstage someplace, Geddy [Lee] and I were sitting down, trading licks, and I said, 'Do you want to do a blues scale? You go first, and then I'll continue the chord pattern,' and he said, 'I don't know what you mean.' At least from what I recall, Geddy didn't understand what a blues scale was or what '1,4,5' meant. That also bears noting that when you go '1,4,5' to a musician, that means something, it's a relationship of notes or chords,"" explained Simmons.""So I go, 'Well, okay then, you hit a G, either octave or low,' and he said, 'Which one is that?' Geddy played purely by ear. Now of course later on, he learned what the notes were and stuff like that,"" revealed the KISS bassist.He also singled out another famous guitarist, revealing, ""It's the same thing with The Edge. The reason you heard 'jingle jangle jingle jangle,' kind of thing — that became the style of U2's guitar sound is when The Edge started playing guitar in a band, he couldn't play chords. He just strummed various notes so, it's all open to ... Music is an interesting thing. You don't have to get complex about it, just start.""Elsewhere in the chat, Simmons revealed of himself, ""I can write songs and I can play various instruments, guitar, bass keyboards, and something like that, and even though I understand the basics of it, I understand that this handheld chord on a guitar is an, A minor, or A major, I understand that. But I can't read or write music. Nor could Jimi Hendrix or Lennon and McCartney or anybody who's in popular music almost without exception. And likewise, I can speak various languages, although it's not important to be able to read or write.""READ MORE: Gene Simmons Promises KISS Are Really Quitting This TimeWhile he may not be able to read or write music, that hasn't stopped Simmons from a legendary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career.

With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow. Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.""Her family also issued a statement that read, “Tina Turner, the ‘Queen of Rock’n Roll’ has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, Switzerland. With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.”Tina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on Nov. 26, 1939. She garnered acclaim in the '50s and '60s with her husband Ike Turner, first as part of the Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, then as part of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. ""A Fool in Love"" was the first charting single in 1960, while the next decade would deliver such classics as ""Proud Mary,"" ""I Want to Take You Higher,"" ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" ""Nutbush City Limits"" and ""It's Gonna Work Out Fine."" Turner earned raves as one of music's most dynamic performers.In 1976, with Turner falling victim to domestic abuse from her husband, she fled a Dallas hotel room after a physical altercation and filed for divorce from Ike Turner later that same month. She started a solo career, making appearances on TV shows later that same year and resumed touring to pay off her debts, but initially struggled on her own to gain any traction as a solo artist.By 1983, things finally started to turn her way with the album Private Dancer, putting her back into the spotlight. It yielded the hugely successful comeback single ""What's Love Got to Do With It,"" along with ""Better Be Good to Me,"" a cover of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and the title track.Turner's story about her struggle and eventual split from Ike Turner would be told in the 1993 film What's Love Got to Do With It, Angela Bassett won the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her portrayal of Turner in the film and also received an Oscar nomination for the role.From there, Turner's star shined throughout the '80s and early '90s with such standout songs as ""We Don't Need Another Hero,"" ""Typical Male,"" ""What You Get Is What You See,"" ""The Best"" and ""I Don't Wanna Fight.""READ MORE: 28 Women Who Pioneered Hard Rock + Heavy MetalTurner won 12 Grammy Awards over the course of her music career and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 2021, following her previous induction for her work with Ike Turner which happened in 1991.

Turner was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo performer in 2021."" Their In Memoriam post notes, ""Two-time Inductee Tina Turner worked hard to reimagine the role of a Black woman in rock & roll — one that was firmly placed front and center. During her time in the duo Ike and Tina Turner (inducted in 1991), her electric onstage presence forever raised the bar for live performance. Their hits 'River Deep–Mountain High' and 'Proud Mary' endure to this day. But this Queen of Rock & Roll went on to make music history again with her solo career (for which she was inducted again in 2021) and with her bravery in sharing her life story as a book, film, and Broadway musical.

Loudwire;George Lynch Explains Decision to Reclaim 'Problematic' Lynch Mob Band Name ;See what he said.;"As recently reported, George Lynch is once again touring under the Lynch Mob band name. The move comes two years after the musician had made the decision to move on from the longtime band name, calling it ""problematic,"" and stating at the time that he felt it was ""inexcusable"" to continue using it. In a new interview, the guitarist reveals why he's now deciding to revert to his former band name after adopting Electric Freedom as his new band moniker in recent years.The subject came up while Lynch was doing an interview with Full In Bloom (as heard below). When asked about the decision to switch back, the guitarist explained, ""[Lynch Mob is] just a brand I'd established for decades, obviously — over three decades. Nothing's perfect, and I've gotta just live with the fact that it has some negative connotations that I probably have to continue explaining for the rest of my life, and I don't mind doing that. But it is a brand that I built, and I'm just gonna stick with it. As far as a marketing thing and a brand thing and a business thing and a working thing, and it keeps my band guys working and it keeps the fans happy, it makes sense.""The guitarist continued, ""I really felt, when I adopted Electric Freedom, that I was really going against the grain more than keeping the old name. I really felt a lot more resistance than I'd ever felt having Lynch Mob; that was actually the reality of it. Nobody really liked it. And I didn't like living with that; it was just kind of uncomfortable. It's, like, 'Okay, well, we've just gotta put up with George's decision here to do this, but nobody agrees with it. We're not comfortable with it.' It has a sort of disingenuous ring to it. As much as my motives were pure — I felt honest — it just never caught on, on all kinds of levels.""In 2020, Lynch explained his decision to move on from the name, stating, ""The name itself, of course, has always been problematic, and now it's inexcusable to keep the name. So, things have just sort of all conspired. A lot of different events triangulated to this point where it just makes sense on every single level to just let it go and wrap it up with and nice neat bow with this record and move on.""When asked if he had received pushback on the name in the past, Lynch stated, ""I may have had a few in the 35 years it's been around, but I'd say probably the most negative criticism I've had of it came from me. So I was my own worst critic with the name, especially in later years. I got a lot more criticism with Electric Freedom.""The guitarist then later spoke of the relationships built with the brand name, commenting, ""It's a brand. I mean, nobody wants Coke to change their recipe. Just stay the same, and that's what you built over the years. Why would you…? 'Why would you change it' is a rhetorical question. Why I'm probably not more successful in some ways in my career is because I followed my aspirations musically rather than sometimes be smart about just sticking to the plan.

Loudwire;Babymetal Mark Their Return With New Song 'Divine Attack - Shingeki -';They're back like you've never heard 'em before.;"It's been quite an interesting year for Babymetal, who disappeared last October after their 10-year anniversary celebrations wrapped up. Last week, which marked a year from the start of the hiatus, they announced a new album called The Other One, and they've now officially made their return with a new track titled ""Divine Attack - Shingeki -.""The Other One is Babymetal's first-ever concept album, and serves as a ""restoration project"" that focuses on their existence within the virtual world dubbed ""Metalverse."" A teaser clip in promotion of the record declared that it tells the ""other"" story of Babymetal. According to a press release, each of the 10 songs on the album will be based on each of the 10 parallel worlds the kawaii metalheads encountered within the Metalverse.""Divine Attack - Shingeki -"" is our first taste of The Other One, and it based on the parallel world Cavalry. It's a bit of a sonic shift away from the heavily-electronic dance metal that they've put out throughout their career so far, supporting the notion that this is a ""new chapter"" for Babymetal. This is also the band's very first set of lyrics that was written by Su-Metal.As displayed on their website, another song will be released in November, January, February and March before the album is finally unveiled on March 24.

Loudwire;Korn's Munky Comments on Taylor Hawkins + His Own Sober Journey;'It's hard to say no still,' the guitarist shared.;"Korn's James ""Munky"" Shaffer answered TMZ's questions at Los Angeles International Airport this week, commenting on his journey with sobriety and the death of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins.The Korn guitarist has been sober for over a decade. Walking into LAX on Wednesday (May 18), he was asked about Monday's Rolling Stone story that suggested Hawkins wanted to lessen his touring with Foo Fighters in his final days. The story was subsequently denounced by two of the musicians and Hawkins associates interviewed for it, Pearl Jam's Matt Cameron and Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith.Hawkins' death in March shocked the music world, as evidenced by the outpouring of support that followed. But there has been no official word that substance abuse contributed, despite a preliminary toxicology report that detected drugs in his system.""It's so sad,"" Shaffer tells TMZ of Hawkins' death. ""I feel so bad for his family and his friends and Dave [Grohl]. I want to send my love to Dave. … They're such great guys. And musicians are so sensitive, really. You have all this persona onstage, but…""Asked if the pressures of touring can ""get to you,"" Shaffer responds, ""It can. I've struggled with my own addictions and mental health. It's fucking hard, and you get out there and you get a lot [of] enablers.""He adds, ""Especially if you deal with addiction, you have that tendency to want to go and do that. But like me, I've been sober 12 years — it's hard to say no still. Even like, 'Aw, let's go — we're gonna go to the hotel lobby and party.' Man, I'm going to go to bed.""The cause of Hawkins' death at 50 is still unknown. He was found dead in Colombia on March 25 before Foos were to play Bogota's Festival Estereo Picnic. The Dave Grohl-led band then canceled all their concerts.Korn's Requiem emerged in February, backed by singles such as ""Start the Healing"" and ""Lost in the Grandeur.""

Loudwire;Till Lindemann Lawyers Obtain Ban Against Newspaper Over Misconduct Allegation Reporting;See the latest in this ongoing case.;"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story listed the U.K. outlet The Mirror as the paper receiving the ban, when it was actually German outlet Der Spiegel. Der Spiegel translates into English as The Mirror.Rammstein and in particular singer Till Lindemann have been in the news of late as sexual misconduct allegations levied against the singer have led to investigations, public backlash and the loss of of a book deal. But, as the singer continues to fight the allegations against him, his legal team has scored a bit of a victory in receiving a temporary ruling that will ban an article by German outlet Der Spiegel over their reporting of the allegations. It's claimed in the ruling that the minimum evidence needed in the report was lacking. In addition, Lindemann's legal team revealed their intent to pursue legal action against other media as well.The concern over the singer's actions first came to light with a fan sharing her account of attending a pre-show party during a concert in Lithuania and explaining that she felt she had been drugged. After the story started to circulate, Rammstein issued a statement that read, ""With regard to the allegations circulating on the internet about Vilnius, we can rule out the possibility that what is being claimed took place in our environment. We are not aware of any official investigations into this matter.""The following week, with more allegations coming to the surface, the German publishing house KiWi posted a statement announcing that they were severing their proposed book collaboration with Lindemann. By mid-June, it was announced that German prosecutors in Berlin had begun an investigation into the singer over alleged sexual assault and drug-related accusations.Once again, Rammstein issued a statement that read as follows:The publications of the last few days have caused irritation and questions among the public and especially among our fans. The allegations hit us all very hard and we take them extremely seriously.We say to our fans: It is important to us that you feel comfortable and safe at our shows — in front of and behind the stage.We condemn any kind of transgressions and ask you: do not engage in public prejudice of any kind against those who have made allegations. You have a right to your point of view.But we, the band, also have a right — namely not to be prejudiced either.On June 15, the band's label, Universal Music, announced that they would halt marketing and promotion of the group while the investigation was ongoing. ""The accusations against Till Lindemann have shocked us and we have the greatest respect for the women who have spoken out so courageously in public in this case,"" said the label in a statement that also included their suspension of promotion.READ MORE: Rammstein Drummer Issues Statement on Till Lindemann AllegationsAs for the latest news in this case, Lindemann's lawyer's issued a press release (seen below) revealing that they had a far-reaching ban against Der Spiegel over their reporting on the Lindemann allegations.""With a temporary ruling by the Hamburg Regional Court on July 14, 2023, Der Spiegel was now prohibited from raising the suspicion that Till Lindemann had drugged or had women drugged at concerts by the Rammstein group with the help of knockout trophies/drugs/alcohol in order to enable him to to be able to take action on the women,"" the statement explained (translated via Google Translate).In the reason for the decision, according to the statement, the Hamburg Regional Court states that the minimum amount of evidence required to honor this serious suspicion is lacking. They add that none of the testimony given by witnesses or those who have provided statements gives rise to the suspicion that Lindemann had used knockout drops, alcohol or drugs to enable him to perform sexual acts on women.They state that Der Spiegel had based their reporting on alleged conversations with a dozen women and claimed that the reporting on the topic of ""Me Too"" had gotten completely out of hand. They called out the paper for ignoring guidelines in reporting allegations, with one-sided statements being offered though the criminal investigation had not been initiated or was in the early stages. That, in turn, led to providing a prejudiced account, which they allege was a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights' (ECHR) presumption of innocence.As stated previously, while the temporary ruling was filed against Der Spiegel over their article, Lindemann's lawyers stated their intent to pursue legal action against other media outlets as well over raised suspicions against their client.The statement comes as two more women have come forward with allegations against Lindemann and Rammstein keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz. Per Süddeutsche Zeitung and NDR (as reported by DW.com) both are sharing accounts of sexual misconduct. You can read those accounts here. The band's recent show in Berlin drew protesters as well as a petition for the show to be canceled amid the ongoing investigation and allegations.";2023-07-18;https://loudwire.com/till-lindemann-lawyers-obtain-ban-the-mirror-misconduct-allegation-reporting/;2023-07-19;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETILLLINDEMANNLAWYERSOBTAINBANAGAINSTNEWSPAPEROVERMISCONDUCTALLEGATIONREPORTING
Loudwire;23 Years Ago: Foo Fighters Release 'There Is Nothing Left to Lose';This is where the Foos 'Learn to Fly.';"There are plenty of ups and downs in history of any long-running band and while Foo Fighters had been through a lot in their relatively short career, in 1999 the band members that were in place were finding a comfort level with each other and it showed in the music.Prior to recording There Is Nothing Left to Lose, Foo Fighters dismissed guitarist Franz Stahl, who had joined the band after the exit of Pat Smear. Stahl was a longtime friend of Dave Grohl pre-dating Grohl's time in Nirvana, but his Foo Fighters stint just did not work out and the band parted ways with the guitarist very early in rehearsals for the new disc. ""I was in tears,"" Grohl told The Guardian about Stahl's exit from the band. But that just unified the trio of Grohl, bassist Nate Mendel and drummer Taylor Hawkins. With Stahl gone, Grohl took on the task of playing guitar on their new disc.Another unifying factor was the fact that the band was in between record labels. After recording their first two discs for Capitol, the band was free of label intervention and decided to leave Hollywood, a place Grohl was becoming more and more disenchanted with, and set up shop in a basement studio he constructed at his home in Alexandria, Va. He called upon Adam Kasper to produce and the trio got away from the L.A. trappings as they set about recording their third release.""Throw all that rock-star bulls--t out the window and you'll find something to believe in,"" said Grohl at the time. ""We were left completely to our own devices. The record was purely our creation. It was complete and not open to outside tampering."" That included the decision to go back to tape. ""The way we recorded was so real and natural,"" said the singer. ""We didn't use any computers, anything digital or any of that auto-tuning shit. All you need are songs that deserve to be heard, a couple of friends and a genuine direction.""As for that direction, Grohl told Kerrang, ""It was all about just settling into the next phase of your life, that place where you can sit back and relax because there had been so much crazy s--t in the past three years. At that point it was me, Taylor and Nate and we were best friends. It was one of the most relaxing times of my whole life. All we did was eat chili, drink beer and whiskey and record whenever we felt like it. When I listen to that record it totally brings me back to that basement. I remember how it smelled and how it was in the spring so the windows were open and we'd do vocals until you could hear the birds through the microphone. And more than any other record I've ever done, that album does that to me.""Once recording was complete, the band chose There Is Nothing Left to Lose as the album title as it conveyed the feeling that Grohl had at the time. ""It's about when you experience these emotions after you've been through a long, difficult period and you finally give into this feeling that, quite simply, there is nothing left to lose. It can seem... positive, desperate and reckless,"" said Grohl. The frontman also told Billboard that it represented the band's mood during production. ""We just wrote off and played like all bets were off. No one was forcing us to be there, so it had to be fun -- and the songs had to be the best we could possibly come up with at the time,"" recalled the singer.With the album complete, Grohl knew a replacement for Stahl was going to be needed for touring purposes. The band held auditions and Chris Shiflett ended up being the choice. ""He fit in with the rest of us so well,"" said Grohl, who also preferred Shiflett's background working with punk bands.Foo Fighters, ""Learn to Fly""On Nov. 2, 1999, Foo Fighters released their third album There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The album may have only reached No. 10 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart, but it turned out to be one of their biggest releases in terms of singles. Leading the way was ""Learn to Fly,"" which arrived in mid-September 1999, a month and a half before the album's release. The song, a melodic rocker, showed a change of pace from the band's heavier output on their previous disc, The Colour and the Shape. It also became a huge MTV favorite thanks to its humorous video with Grohl, Hawkins and Mendel playing multiple passengers and members of a flight crew being sabotaged by Tenacious D's Jack Black and Kyle Gass.The song hit No. 1 on Alternative, No. 2 on Mainstream Rock and cracked the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 19. Plus the Jesse Peretz-directed video received a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. But even with all the success, Grohl told The Guardian that ""Learn to Fly"" was ""one of my least favorite songs on the record."" Still, there was no denying the love for the song and it's become one of the band's biggest hits.Foo Fighters, ""Stacked Actors""The vitriolic ""Stacked Actors,"" based on Grohl's disdain for the Hollywood lifestyle, was the next single. ""[The song is] a blast of feedback and then a tuned-down Sabbath-on-speed type riff before blowing into this weird calypso-type thing with vocals that sound like Steve Miller,"" said Grohl to the Guardian about the song. The band performed the song during an appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman and the track did crack the Top 10 at Mainstream Rock radio, but has fallen in and out of set lists over the years.Foo Fighters, ""Breakout""The other major single off the album was ""Breakout,"" a high-energy rocker that got an extra push due to its inclusion in the Jim Carrey film Me, Myself and Irene. Delivering a rather soft opening, the track opens up into a full-throttle rocker with Grohl reaching full scream. Grohl also appeared in the video for the song, which included Me, Myself & Irene actors Anthony Anderson, Tony Cox and Traylor Howard, as well as the singer's mother.Other songs receiving attention off the disc included ""Generator,"" which employed a talk box in parts of the song. The track was only released in Australia and Europe and never really received much attention stateside. They also received some attention for the melodic rocker ""Next Year,"" which served as a theme for the NBC TV series Ed.Foo Fighters, ""Next Year""By the time the album cycle was over, Foo Fighters had earned their first Best Rock Album Grammy. It would be the first of three in a row for the band. Despite barely cracking the Top 10, the album would go on to be certified platinum. Reflecting on the disc in a 2006 interview, Grohl told Kerrang that the album was ""totally based on melody"" and ""might be the favorite album that we've ever done.""Top 66 Hard Rock + Metal Frontmen";2022-10-30;https://loudwire.com/foo-fighters-there-is-nothing-left-to-lose-album-anniversary/;2022-11-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE23YEARSAGO:FOOFIGHTERSRELEASE'THEREISNOTHINGLEFTTOLOSE'
Loudwire;When Nirvana Intentionally Ruined 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' on TV - Watch;Kurt's impression of British rock royalty is hilarious.;"Due to the very essence of Top of the Pops, it seemed fated that Nirvana would try and destroy it. TOTP was a British version of American Bandstand and America's Top 40 rolled into one. The TV show had performances of some of the week's best-selling pop records and ran down that week's singles chart. In 1991, they invited America's grunge band du jour to perform on the show.Aside from it's inherent packaged-for-the-TV-masses mentality that a band like Nirvana would most likely find annoying anyway, Top of the Pops had another quirk that grated on performers desire for authenticity: TOTP's rule that bands HAD to use a backing track to sing over. There was no playing ""live."" (This rule used to be even more restrictive. Pre-1991, vocalists had to lip-sync to their songs. Everything was recorded.)Many artists found this to be ridiculous. In 1990, Faith No More's Mike Patton seemed to be playing along, lip-synching along to the first single from The Real Thing, ""From Out of Nowhere."" Then Patton started sticking his tongue in and out and flippity-flopping his fingers near his mouth, making it obvious he wasn't actually singing. He fell back in line for a minute, then went totally juvenile: poking his tongue into his cheek for that classic teenager faux fellatio mime.Faith No More's Mike Patton Mocks Top of the PopsPatton's mockery was nothing compared to what Nirvana did a year later.  Asked to come on and perform Smells Like Teen Spirit, after the single was selling like crazy in the UK and climbed to number 9 on the charts there, Nirvana methodically butchered their show.The performance starts as the backing track begins and Kurt is strumming his guitar like Munch from the Chuck E. Cheese band.  Bassist Krist Novoselic is swinging his axe over his head.  Dave Grohl is putting the most reasonable act forward by at least sitting at his kit and pretending to play the drums.When it comes time for Cobain to sing, he changes the opening lines then proceeds to do the rest of the song in a Morrisey (from The Smiths) impression. They are, as the Brits say, taking the piss outta the show. It mercifully ends as some audience members get up on stage and dance lamely while Kurt takes off his guitar altogether.

While there are typically music performances associated with those earning induction by the Rock Hall's voting body, it's not as clear where those receiving the special honors are concerned, but thanks to drummer Scott Travis, we now know that Priest are planning a performance.Travis was a guest on the Rocker Morning Show with Mark Frankhouse for 107.7 RKR in Kalamazoo, Michigan (heard below), where he discussed the upcoming induction ceremony.""Naturally, it's a super honor. I always felt that Priest would get in eventually, only because you can't have something called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and not have Judas Priest in it. So there were a couple of events prior to this year where we were nominated — I think that's the right word; I'm not sure — but we were in the running. And we didn't quite get in, but I was always confident,"" says Travis. ""Priest will get in eventually, and same thing with some of the bands that aren't in yet — they will get in. But yeah, it's a super honor. And there's nothing else you can say about it, really. It's pretty cool.""As for whether or not we'll see a musical representation, Travis divulged, ""Yeah, we are. They give you a limited amount of time 'cause there's obviously lots of artists that are gonna be performing. So they gave us a set amount of time to perform. And we decided we're gonna try and work in a medley and do some of the Priest classics and put 'em all into a medley, which we've never done before. So it should be interesting.""Priest will go into the Rock Hall on Nov. 5, joining their fellow inductees at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.Judas Priest's Scott Travis Speaks With 107.7 RKRJudas Priest Albums Ranked";2022-10-03;https://loudwire.com/judas-priest-performing-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2022/;2022-10-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREJUDASPRIESTWILLACTUALLYBEPERFORMINGATROCKANDROLLHALLOFFAMEAFTERALL
Loudwire;Anthrax's Scott Ian Recalls First Time Hearing Alice in Chains - They Were Black Sabbath Heavy;He initially thought they were a hair band.;"When you really like a certain band, you often have a vivid memory of the first time you listened to them. Anthrax's Scott Ian recalled the first time he heard Alice in Chains in a new interview, admitting that he initially thought they were a hair band, but was blown away.Ian told Metal Hammer that his first exposure to the Seattle rockers was when Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer were choosing who they wanted to support them on the American leg of their massive Clash of the Titans tour. Dave Mustaine gave Ian a CD copy of Alice's debut album Facelift to listen to.""I hadn’t even heard of them, and I thought it was some hair band. And I put it on in the car on the way home and I was blown away. I could not believe how fucking good it was,"" he remembered. ""It was not thrash and it was not '80s hard rock. They had the riffs, the hooks, the vocals, but there was this pop thing to it – I mean, 'Man in the Box' is a straight-up pop song in terms of arrangement, but it’s so fucking heavy. Like, Black Sabbath heavy.""Alas, Alice were invited to join the Clash of the Titans tour, which ran from May through mid-July of 1991. Setlist.fm notes that their average setlist included 7 songs on that tour, opening with ""Would?"" — which would initially come out the following year on the soundtrack for the movie Singles — and closed with ""Man in the Box.""""I remember the first show they played on the Clash of the Titans tour, and I expected them to just be up there shoegazing, but they were jumping around, headbanging, Layne [Staley] was in the crowd’s faces. He’d jump in the crowd and fight people,"" Ian remarked of Alice's performances.“There’s this myth of darkness around them, but those guys were just fucking goofballs. We stayed in the same hotels every day, there were many, many nights spent drinking with them, we’d go fishing with them. But when came to facing down thousands of Slayer and Megadeth and Anthrax fans, they would not back down.

Loudwire;Pat Benatar Cuts 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' From Concerts Due to Mass Shootings;'You have to draw the line,' says the singer.;"It's a big year for Pat Benatar, who will go into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, but as she also brings some of her biggest songs to the stage on tour this year, one track is notably missing. ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot,"" the second single from her 1980 Crimes of Passion album, will not be played on this run out of deference to the families of recent mass shooting victims in the U.S.The veteran vocalist revealed the decision while speaking with USA Today about her song choices on the tour. ""We have what we call the 'holy 14,' songs that if we don’t play them, you’ll give us (a hard time),"" said Benatar before revealing, ""We’re not doing 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' and fans are having a heart attack.""She then explained, ""I’m like, I’m sorry, in deference to the victims of the families of these mass shootings, I’m not singing it. I tell them, if you want to hear the song, go home and listen to it. (The title) is tongue in cheek, but you have to draw the line. I can’t say those words out loud with a smile on my face, I just can’t. I’m not going to go onstage and soap box – I go to my legislators – but that’s my small contribution to protesting. I’m not going to sing it.

Wade by the Supreme Court and how it reflects on her work. She responded, ""Well, 'Invincible' is really important. I’m worried, like all of us, about fundamental autonomy rights.

Loudwire;Machine Gun Kelly + Megan Fox Dressed as Tommy Lee + Pam Anderson for Halloween, Fans React;Looking good, you two!;There are few former rock music couples more famous than Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson, so perhaps it's no great shock that Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox dressed as them for Halloween this year. Likewise, the fact that fans have reacted in a multitude of ways is no less surprising.As reported by Entertainment Weekly yesterday (Oct. 29), the romantic pair attended tequila brand Casamigos’ Halloween party in Beverly Hills this past Friday (Oct. 28). While there, they captured how Lee and Anderson looked at the 1995 grand opening of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.Specifically, Kelly emulated Lee’s famous white tank top and leather pants while Fox seemingly adorned Anderson’s eye-catching red and pink latex dress and blonde hair. Of course, Kelly played Lee in the 2019 film The Dirt, so the decision to dress like him this year makes sense.In addition to posting two photos for a side-by-side comparison between the two couples, Kelly uploaded to Instagram a short video of himself snorting, well, something off of Fox’s chest before kissing her.The clip’s caption reads, “happy Halloween virgins 👼🏼,” and you can see it below:As expected, their costumes garnered a lot of reactions on social media. For instance, one Instagram follower replied to Kelly’s post: “Hahha this is next level.” In contrast, someone commented on Entertainment Weekly’s Facebook page: “That’s a whole lotta train wreck there.”Predictably, Twitter users were equally mixed, as you can see by scrolling down:What do YOU think of their decision to dress as Lee and Anderson?

Loudwire;Linkin Park Launch Cryptic, Old School Countdown on Website - But What For?;What are Linkin Park teasing here?;"Linkin Park have launched a cryptic countdown on their website that has a five-day timer earlier today (Jan. 27) at 3PM ET.Not much has been heard from the band or its members in recent months, so any activity from Linkin Park on this scale feels pretty significant. And even though the countdown pages don't contain a whole lot of information, there's some huge clues that could perhaps lead fans to solving the mystery before the clock expires on Wednesday, Feb. 1.What's on the website?Not a whole lot. But enough to poke around and start asking questions about what this could be.The welcome screen greets you with a photo collage and a pop-up window prompting you to click the OKAY button.""DOWNLOAD A FREE COPY OF LiNkiNgPaRk-nUmB.exe,"" it says on the screen.There's a couple things to note:First, the file says ""Linking"" instead of Linkin and, most obviously, it appears to be about the hit song ""Numb,"" off Meteora, which will celebrate its 20th anniversary on March 25 later this year.Linkin Park Countdown Sitelinkinpark.comloading...Once you hit okay, the website tricks you into thinking a file is about to appear in your download folder, but things go awry and you're instead met with a blue screen.On this screen is the active countdown timer (screenshotted below with four days, 23 hours, 27 minutes and 50 seconds left) as well as a message about that ""Numb"" file.""""DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION_LiNkiNgPaRk-nUmB.exe,"" the file title now reads with a series of ""recovered links"" directing you elsewhere on the site, one of them regarding Linkin Park's debut album ""Hybrid Theory.""Linkin Park Countdown Sitelinkinpark.comloading...What is an .exe file?We understand — there's a chance you may not even know what type of file you were so recently so eager to download.An .exe file stands for ""executable file"" and, at its most basic, is described by Tech Target, as a file that ""contains an encoded sequence of instructions that the system can execute directly when the user clicks the file icon.""Have Linkin Park posted anything about this?Yup.

However, don't get me wrong — when a certain song needs to sound big, then it sounds very big.""Guitarist Esa Holopainen added, ""It really is a great feeling that we can still produce very decent music as a band.

Loudwire;Danish Museum Now in Possession of That Viral Lars Ulrich Toilet;For whom the bowl tolls.;"Just when you thought you may have heard the last about the fan-built Lars Ulrich toilet that went viral late last year, the story has taken an even more peculiar and unexpected turn. The Ripley's Believe It Or Not! museum located in Denmark, the Metallica drummer's home country, is now reportedly in possession of the one-of-a-kind commode.""Make no mistake, this is not me taking a jab at Lars. This is my way, albeit unconventional, to honor Lars Ulrich and Metallica,"" the Tampa Bay-based Prince Midnight, the master craftsman responsible for the toilet's construction, told Loudwire last year. ""I could have painted a picture or made a traditional sculpture, but no one would have even noticed, and really, that's not the kind of art and performance I do. The first band I ever loved was Metallica, the first record I became obsessed with, the first music I ever dove into, the concert I ever attended,"" he further explained.Now, according to the Tampa Bay Times, his work is going international and is set to be shipped from the Ripley Entertainment warehouse in Orlando, Florida all the way to the Ripley's ""odditorium"" in Copenhagen, the capital city of Denmark.“Don’t worry, this will be featured in a gallery, not the bathroom,"" Ripley Entertainment's Sabrina Sieck said to the news outlet.The toilet was constructed using ""a ton of natural clay from the art store to sculpt the body and legs"" and Prince Midnight further explained to Loudwire, ""I used alginate to mold and cast my own hands and feet in resin. I saved the facial sculpt for last, using photos of Lars from the '80s. Then, like the hands and feet, I made a mold and cast it in resin. I ran steel rebar through the whole thing with fiberglass batting. My backyard has essentially been an auto body shop for the last couple of months.""And if you're wondering... yes, the toilet is 100 percent flushable and functioning.

Loudwire;Rammstein Respond to Allegations That Fan Was Drugged During Band's Concert Pre-Party;The claims have been circulating online since last week.;"Rammstein have responded to allegations made against them online by a woman who has claimed that she was drugged during a party before their concert in Lithuania last week.The claims were first posted on the Rammstein Reddit page on May 23 by a user named Shelby69666, who'd attended the band's concert in Vilnius the day prior and was apparently invited to a pre-party by a member of their crew. In a since-deleted post titled ""Fuck Rammstein,"" she uploaded a photo of a large bruise with the caption, ""Spiked, no idea when this happened."" The post stirred a lot of discussion on the Reddit page, but many of the posts were quickly removed by one of its moderators because it was considered hearsay. Read the moderators' post regarding the removal of the threads here.On May 24, Shelby wrote about her alleged experience in several threads on Twitter.""I was invited to Row 0 by Aleena Makeeva. I messaged her last week on Instagram asking how on earth do you get into after party, and that I would love to be considered. She asked my age and where I’m from, once I confirmed she then sent me a link to a WhatsApp group,"" Shelby wrote.As noted by various fans on Reddit, Makeeva tours with Rammstein and typically connects with female fans to invite them to the front row during the band's shows, as well as parties before and after the concert.According to the rest of Shelby's tweets, she, a group of girls and one man were escorted to Row 0 by Joe Letz, who plays drums in Lindemann and also tours with Rammstein. She says he invited a couple of the girls from the group to attend an exclusive party before the show, where they had to leave their cellphones on a table in the room and were encouraged to make drinks with the alcohol provided for them.Shelby stated she only had two drinks during the party, and was then called over by Letz, who invited her to meet Till Lindemann privately underneath the stage during the concert. She asked Letz if the meeting was a ""sex thing,"" and says he responded that it wasn't, adding that the singer is a ""perfect gentleman"" and that they would meet during the DJ interlude. A few minutes later, Lindemann allegedly made an appearance at the party and took a shot of Tequila with a couple of the girls, then smashed some of the shot glasses.Shelby claimed that the show started shortly after 8PM, and that she felt very intoxicated by that point. She further asserted that when she was led to meet Lindemann under the stage, she told him she didn't want to engage in sex with him, and claims he had an outburst and stormed out of the room.READ MORE: The 'Big 4' Bands of 27 Rock + Metal SubgenresShe says she was eventually led back to Row 0 with the other girls, and then has vague memories of the next party that took place after the show. She stated she didn't drink anymore alcohol at the party, and then vomited in the bathroom and left to go back to her hotel. She apparently felt sick the whole next day, and took a pharmacy drug test, as suggested by the local police, but it came up clean.Shelby's entire Twitter page consists of tweets about the night. She's also shared screenshots of conversations with some of the other girls at the party, video footage of her at the concert and the after party and photos and videos of bruises on her body the next day.Rammstein have since responded to the allegations in their own tweet on May 28, writing, ""With regard to the allegations circulating on the internet about Vilnius, we can rule out the possibility that what is being claimed took place in our environment. We are not aware of any official investigations into this matter.""After several reports came out, Shelby has since clarified in her tweets that she never claimed she was sexually assaulted or abused by anyone in the Rammstein camp, only that she was drugged.We've included some of Shelby's tweets below, but please note that there are many more on her Twitter page, which you can read for yourself here. Rammstein's post is included in the tweets below as well. Top 25 Industrial Rock + Metal Bands of All Time";2023-05-30;https://loudwire.com/rammstein-respond-allegations-fan-drugged-pre-party/;2023-05-31;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRERAMMSTEINRESPONDTOALLEGATIONSTHATFANWASDRUGGEDDURINGBAND'SCONCERTPRE-PARTY

Loudwire;28 Years Ago: Pearl Jam Overcome Internal Strife on 'Vitalogy';On Dec. 6, 1994, Pearl Jam issued their chaotic third album 'Vitalogy.';"Things couldn't have been better on the surface. Pearl Jam debuted to great acclaim with the Ten album, followed by setting opening week sales records with their follow-up Vs. and were one of the hottest tickets on tour. But there was plenty of drama behind the scenes as they made the transition to writing and recording their third album, Vitalogy.""Vitalogy was a little strained,"" revealed producer Brendan O'Brien to Spin, adding, ""I'm being polite -- there was some imploding going on."" The disc was primarily penned while the band was on the road promoting their Vs. album and the dynamics in the group were changing. Stone Gossard, who was viewed as the band's creative force and leader early on was stepping back while Eddie Vedder asserted himself even more. The group also dealt with a growing alcohol and substance abuse issue with guitarist Mike McCready, made the decision to split with drummer Dave Abbruzzese and found themselves in the midst of a very public battle with ticketing giant Ticketmaster, forcing them to create their own alternatives in the ways of staging shows.""Communication was at an all-time low,"" bassist Jeff Ament told Spin of the creative process at the time. With the band often stretched for time demands and barriers starting to form, the one place they could connect was jam sessions and scheduled studio time. Gossard told Musician, ""It was probably the only record we could have made due to the problems we were going through in relating. We really weren't collaborating with each other at the time very much. So the only way we could make something happen was by going into the studio and deciding on it then and there, in the moment. Eighty percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded. Eddie had 'Better Man' from a long time ago, but most of the songs were a result of jamming in the studio and coming up with a quick arrangement. It felt like what we needed to do to really break the band open.""As for making the decision for him to step back, the guitarist added, ""If it had remained always my band, my natural tendency would have been to get more complex and arrange things more and more. That wouldn't necessarily be good for Eddie, or anyone else in the band. Of course, I enjoy being self-indulgent. [laughs] And I look forward to the time when I can become more indulgent with my songwriting. But this band is a family, and it's a process that we have to grow with together.""According to Gossard, Vedder becoming the band's leader was a gradual process. He explained, ""There's no getting around the fact that Eddie is the man. As far as emotional and spiritual energy goes, he IS the leader of this band. But Eddie does not make all the decisions. Eddie can listen to reason; Eddie can be swayed or talked in or out of certain things. Eddie allows other people to lead in this band and to have certain roles that are very fundamental to the decision-making process. Eddie is a natural leader. Jeff and I have been very much in control of previous bands we've worked in. But the way Eddie grew into being the leader of this band was the most gradual, slow and respectful process that I've ever been involved in. That's not to say Eddie's never done anything malicious. But he never grabbed power for power's sake.""Pearl Jam, ""Better Man""With touring taking up a majority of the time, the band broke up their recording sessions. A late 1993 session in New Orleans yielded ""Tremor Christ"" and ""Nothingman."" They would also spend time in their native Seattle as well as Atlanta working and recording new music, before eventually retreating to Bad Animals studio in Seattle after their tour completion to finish things up.Two key things happened during the recording to ensure the future of the band. First, guitarist Mike McCready decided to enter rehab. Gossard revealed, ""Mike's a pretty awful drunk. Not that he got malicious or mean openly to people, but he would get out of control consistently. It was a difficult situation where you could find yourself blaming Mike for a lot of your own frustrations with the band when he was f--ked up or couldn't come to practice. And we're used to loving Mike and knowing how much fun and how talented he is. I got upset that he might throw away a great opportunity to be in a cool band and work it out. He decided to go into treatment and everyone was thrilled. How could you not be? Here was Mike taking responsibility for himself and his own happiness, going to a new level."" After rehab, Gossard stated that McCready was ""as raw as he ever was,"" but that it was a better situation for everyone and that they were thrilled to have him in the band.Meanwhile, things came to a head with drummer Dave Abbruzzese. During recording, the drummer had to have his tonsils removed one day and the band managed to record the song ""Satan's Bed"" with his drum tech Jimmy Shoaf handling duties. Months later, personality conflicts with Abbruzzese took a toll and the band decided to part ways with the drummer. Gossard stated, ""It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled."" Eventually the band called upon Jack Irons, who had initially recommended Vedder to Pearl Jam, to help them complete the disc. Gossard recalled, ""If we didn't find a drummer that everyone felt good about, it would have been difficult to keep moving forward. Jack's just a very generous and wise drummer. He concentrates on the groove of a song, and that allows everybody's heart to have a place to sit, and yet be part of the whole. He's very conscious of what everybody's playing. He's working to balance out all the elements of the band.""As stated, Vedder took on a bigger role with Vitalogy, not only in terms of writing, but also playing guitar more within the creative process. With Pearl Jam's success reaching new heights and attention being heaped upon the band, Vedder was careful not to let it overwhelm the creative process. ""The only thing that worries me musically is that everything we put out is so under the microscope that it ends up seeping into the songs, and suddenly the music is bombastic just to be able to resist or survive the inspection,"" said Vedder to Spin. ""There are things on Vitalogy that are definitely not typical, so I'm trying to battle against that. There's two ways: You either give the people what they want, or you become cynical and that protects you.""By the time the end of 1994 rolled around, the band was finally ready to release their third album. Vitalogy first arrived as a vinyl release on Nov. 22 and sold 34,000 copies its first week. That stood as an opening week record for vinyl until Jack White's Lazaretto in 2014. The more traditional release date for the CD version came on Dec. 6, 1994. It sold 877,000 copies the first week, which made it the second fastest selling album in music history at the time, only trailing the band's previous album Vs. in the record books.Pearl Jam, ""Spin the Black Circle""Leading off the album was the release of the high energy rocker ""Spin the Black Circle,"" issued in early November in advance of the album release. ""I remember wanting everything to be faster,"" said Vedder to Rolling Stone. ""Stone gave me this riff. I had a speed control machine. I speeded it up, came back and said, 'Can we do it this way?'"" But the style didn't necessarily connect with all of Vedder's bandmates. Bassist Jeff Ament told NME, ""I was like, 'Ugh ... I can't play the entire Dead Kennedys back catalogue!' I didn't really want to make music like that at the time."" Meanwhile, McCready told Guitar School that the track proved to be one of the more challenging songs for him. ""I actually overdubbed those leads, but when I do it live, that riff is so hectic and frantic, I have to be warmed up or it sounds really sh--ty,"" said the guitarist. The song would be the lone Vitalogy track to crack the Billboard Top 40, reaching No. 18 on the charts. It would top out at No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock charts and No. 11 at Modern Rock. But ""Spin the Black Circle"" would give the band their first Grammy Award, winning at the 1996 ceremony for Best Hard Rock Performance. Not exactly wowed, Vedder stated upon acceptance, ""I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything.""""Spin the Black Circle"" had a b-side, ""Tremor Christ,"" which also did quite well for the band. The track reached No. 16 at both Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock despite its b-side nature. Vedder recalls, ""We recorded 'Tremor Christ' in a very short period, one night in New Orleans, and I remember what that night was like. I can see how the lights were turned down low. I can see the room. And so I like listening to that."" McCready added, ""I wrote part of that one. It's kind of an odd, marching Beatles tune. It's just a strange song. It was written in New Orleans. The groove reconciles itself after you get into it.""Pearl Jam, ""Not for You""The next proper single was ""Not For You,"" a defiant rocker primarily penned by Vedder about the nature of music. ""These attitudes out there...that it's the industry's music... And it's not. It's mine. And it's yours. Whoever's listening to it. It's mine and it's yours. And everybody in between, they're the distributors,"" expressed Vedder to Singapore's BIGO. ""I think that something like a music channel can be very powerful. Sometimes they think they're the ones who decide what's heard. I think that's a dangerous situation. And, I think, what's more dangerous is that they think it belongs to them. That's probably what 'Not for You' is about."" The song also holds a good memory for McCready, who revealed that he recorded the track using a 12-string Rickebacker gifted to him by Tom Petty. He recalled, ""[It] was the first time I used. It was like a Christmas present. One day it just showed up at my door. I called him up and thanked him."" ""Not for You"" would reach No. 12 at Mainstream Rock radio.The final ""single"" released by Pearl Jam off of Vitalogy was ""Immortality,"" a dark and somber track within the disc. Fans and media began to try to connect the dots between the lyrical content and the death of Kurt Cobain, who passed in the spring of 1994, but Vedder revealed that any association was not intended. ""That was written while we were on tour in Atlanta. It's not about Kurt,"" he told the Los Angeles Times, adding, ""Nothing on the album was written directly about Kurt, and I don't feel like talking about him, because it [might be seen] as exploitation. But I think there might be some things in the lyrics that you could read into and maybe will answer some questions or help you understand the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.""Pearl Jam, ""Immortality""Though not released as a commercial single, the biggest track off the album proved to be ""Better Man,"" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and topped out at No. 2 at Modern Rock. The song has also become a favorite at live shows, with the crowd often triumphantly singing the opening vocals back to Vedder. The singer actually penned the song on a four-track in his apartment prior to joining Pearl Jam, but it didn't become a song until the Vitalogy album. During a taping of VH1's Storytellers, Gossard ribbed Vedder, stating, ""Just think of how many songs he has hidden away."" O'Brien revealed to Spin that he felt the song was a hit, but that Vedder had wanted to give it away for a Greenpeace benefit record. He recalls, ""I remember saying to the engineer, Nick [DiDia], 'This is one of their best songs and they're going to give it away! Can't happen!' And we went to record it and I'm not going to say we didn't try very hard, but it didn't end up sounding very good. I may have even sabotaged that version but I won't admit to that. It took us to the next record, recording it two more times, before he became comfortable with it because it was such a blatantly great pop song."" Luckily the song stuck and has remained one of their most popular tracks.Vitalogy also yielded several other popular tracks within the band's history. ""Corduroy"" dealt with the corporatization and marketing of the band's sound, look and genre. ""That song was based on a remake of the brown corduroy jacket that I wore. I think I got mine for 12 bucks, and it was being sold for like $650. The ultimate one as far as being co-opted was that there was a guy on TV, predictably patterned, I guess, after the way I was looking those days, with long hair and an Army T-shirt. They put this new character on a soap opera, so there was a guy, more handsome than I, parading around on General Hospital. And the funny thing is, that guy was Ricky Martin,"" said Vedder to AV Club.Pearl Jam, ""Corduroy""Meanwhile, ""Nothingman"" was another favorite that came together quickly. ""[It was] written in an hour, and so I like listening to that 'cause it just happened and somehow captured a mood there, at least for me in the vocal. Any time I can nail down a song, a thought, in a half hour, that feels really good,"" said Vedder to Spin. He told the Los Angeles Times, ""The idea is about if you love someone and they love you, don't f--k up...'cause you are left with less than nothing.""As for the touring in support of Vitalogy, it presented its own set of challenges. Pearl Jam were embroiled in a battle with Ticketmaster over the company's exorbitant service charges.  Speaking about their stance, Vedder told Spin, ""We don't want to exclude anybody from the experience. The experience of a father taking his son to the concert even though he works at a gas station... or even being able to afford a t-shirt. What music can do to your life, what one night of live music, if all the elements are in place, how it can affect your life. It might make this kid pick up a guitar. Who knows what it will do.""They vowed to not play Ticketmaster venues but that led to some serious scheduling issues and plenty of stress. It also didn't help that other acts weren't rushing to their side in the battle. ""I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music,"" said Vedder. Ament added, ""We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.""Despite the drama offstage and with their touring, it didn't appear to hurt Vitalogy commercially or critically. The disc debuted at No. 1 and has gone on to be certified five times platinum. Meanwhile, Vitalogy earned Best Rock Album and Album of the Year nominations at the Grammy Awards, and while the band didn't win either category, they earned their first Grammy statue for ""Spin the Black Circle"" as Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996.Pearl Jam Albums Ranked";2022-12-06;https://loudwire.com/pearl-jam-vitalogy-album-anniversary/;2022-12-07;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE28YEARSAGO:PEARLJAMOVERCOMEINTERNALSTRIFEON'VITALOGY'

Loudwire;Black Keys Reconnect to Blue Collar Roots in 'Wild Child' Video, Announce New Album;Watch The Black Keys get schooled, then school others!;"Did the Black Keys just give up a lucrative music career just to take jobs as high school janitor and cook? Nah, but that's the premise of their new video for ""Wild Child,"" as the duo of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney attempt to ""reconnect to their blue collar roots"" by doing some hard time amongst the youth of today. ""Wild Child"" also marks the first taste of music we're getting from their next studio album, Dropout Boogie.The Bryan Schlam-directed video finds the musicians initially turning up in the teachers lounge at a school, getting roasted by the burned out educators. But this ruse is all just part of a larger plan for the musical duo. ""We're gonna reconnect with our blue collar roots then we're out,"" says Carney, before Auerbach assures, ""For ... the ... album.""It doesn't take that long for the day to turn nightmarish for the pair, who eventually turn in their resignation, doff their work clothes for tuxes and leave the kiddies behind (with middle fingers extended) as they ride off in their luxury vehicles.The humorous video is soundtracked by the swagger-filled new song ""Wild Child,"" and there is actually some connection to the exaggerated video storyline for the band and the pair have recently reconnected with their love of music over the last few records.After taking a hiatus, the band returned in 2019 with Let's Rock., but admittedly they didn't immediately feel they were back on track. “We had grown apart and we were reconnecting,” recalled Carney to Rolling Stone. “It was really good to get back into the studio, but we were still learning how to work with each other.”Last year's Delta Kream covers album followed, with the duo once again starting to reclaim the mojo. “We recorded it in a day, no overdubs, and it’s one of my favorite records we’ve ever done,” says Auerbach of Delta Kream. “And that made us want to repeat the project, just getting in there and letting it roll and seeing whatever happens.”“It ended up being a great reset of the band. It just showed us that the most important thing is that it’s fun,” said Carney.So nearly immediately after Delta Kream arrived, the pair were back at it starting Dropout Boogie, which counts Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright, Americana vocalist Sierra Farrell and ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons among their collaborations.“I feel Pat and I are in a better place than we’ve ever been,” says Auerbach, with Carney telling Rolling Stone, “This one, we thought deeply about what we were doing but we never struggled with anything. No big disagreements.”""Pat and I always wanted this,” Auerbach adds. “We still have the same drive. We want to create something good. We’ve never lost that, I don’t think. It’s our favorite thing to do, this passion for making records.”Dropout Boogie is due May 13 via Nonesuch Records. The full artwork and track listing can be seen below.

Loudwire;Dave Lombardo to Miss Testament's 2023 Touring, Calls Future With the Band 'Wait-and-See';See what is keeping Lombardo from touring with Testament.;"Dave Lombardo is a man of many bands, and one of them will be without his services for the remainder of 2023. The drummer revealed to Blabbermouth that he will be sitting out the rest of Testament's touring for the year, while putting his focus musically elsewhere.Speaking about his priorities for this year, the former Slayer stickman explained, ""Let's start with Suicidal [Tendencies]. I haven't been able to play with Suicidal became he [Mike Muir] is not on tour as often or as much as I'd like. When I joined them in 2016, man, it was on. But then the pandemic, and I believe he has [health] issues. I think he's had a couple of surgeries on his back. It's limited the amount of shows he does a year. I haven't played with them in a while.""He continued, ""I""m focusing on the Misfits, Mr. Bungle, Empire State Bastard, and in 2022, when I was on tour with Testament, I had stuff lined up that was starting to build for 2023. With Testament, we were having several scheduling conflicts. I couldn't back out of them. I won't be joining them on their upcoming tours for 2023. My focus is on Bungle, who I've recorded an album with back in 2019 and we did a live album. Empire State Bastard, I recorded an album for them in 2020. That's finally going to see the light of day later this year. We've already released a single.""READ MORE: 10 Times Dave Lombardo Was the Best Drummer on EarthHe added, ""I'm not doing the shows with Satanic Planet ... I won't be performing with them. Instead of doing live shows, I really like to just be more on the production and songwriting side [with them]. It's very industrial, very dark. It's got a very evil vibe, but great guys nonetheless. Some of the most kindest people I've met in my life, which contrasts with the music.""As for whether there's a future with Testament, which he stepped into after Gene Hoglan's exit in 2022, Lombardo said, ""I don't know, because everything is starting to snowball with Mr. Bungle and Empire State Bastard and the Misfits."" He went on to call his status ""wait-and-see,"" adding, ""I can't guarantee anything because of my commitments. I did fulfill my contractual commitment for 2022, which was quite extensive. We did one of the longest tours I have done. It was like seven weeks in Europe, which was great. I really needed to get out there and build my chops after the pandemic. That was a lifesaver. We'll see. The relationship is good. The doors are open. The communication is there. I told them that I was seeing some clashes coming up. This was in the first week of January when I reached out to Eric [Peterson] and told him. This has been brewing for a while.""As for who will be filling the drum slot on Testament's forthcoming dates, it appears that drummer Chris Dovas of Seven Spires, who previously filled in for Lombardo on the band's 2022 tour leg, will be handling those duties. Recent photos shared by bassist Steve DiGiorgio (seen below) on his Instagram revealed Dovas was rehearsing with the band for their South American tour.

Loudwire;Nita Strauss - Fan Threw 'Sweaty Boxers' During Alice Cooper Show;If you're gonna do that, please make sure they are clean and dry.;"Alice Cooper shredder and solo artist Nita Strauss tells a story of some unwanted attention thrown her way, in the form of a pair of sweaty boxer briefs that were chucked up on stage near the end of a show. She related the ""love toss"" story on her Instagram page a couple days ago (July 5.)Strauss puts this in the Instagram category, ""Underwear Stories,"" and says it happened at an Alice Cooper show in ""an unnamed city"" in 2021.Touring had just started back up post lockdown, and the band and fans were in a good mood. In the front row, around my side of the stage was a group of a few younger guys. They were having a ball. Singing the words, headbanging along, shaking their fists in the air and raising the horns at all the appropriate times. One of the guys in particular was trying to get my attention throughout the show, blowing kisses and making that heart-hands symbol every time I glanced in that direction. 'a bit much,' I mused, but I was happy to see people at a show having fun and didn't think much of it. 'Teenage Frankenstein' rolls around, the second to last song. I glance down. The guy is gone. Smart! Probably beating the traffic out of here. 'School's Out'. The guy is back. His friends are cracking up. I was wrapped up in the show and didn't notice something wadded up in one of his hands. 'No more pencils, no more booooooks…' Suddenly, a gray, sweaty UFO hurtled onto the stage and landed on the center riser, between me and Alice. We all immediately BURST into uncontrollable laughter. The guy's boxer briefs were brazenly laid out on the riser, showing ALL the after effects of being worn all day at a hot, outdoor August show. Mercifully, Chuck [Garric, bass] or maybe Ryan [Roxie, guitar] hooked the waistband of the boxers onto their headstock.""Everyone knew which guy it came from. Chuck (or maybe Ryan) deftly lifted the undies up and flung them back in the guy's direction- but since headstock tossing is notoriously inaccurate- overshot the throw by a couple rows. As a result, an innocent bystander a few rows back who had his hands in the air and mouth wide open, probably screaming 'WELL WE GOT NO CLASS, and WE GOT NO PRINCI-' suddenly got a face full of front row guy's sweaty underwear. The 'AAAAGGHHHHHH' was audible over the concert noise and I think that was one of many times I actually fell down from laughing so hard.""The moral of the story is this: Don't throw your boxers at a girl unless you're prepared for them to go places you didn't expect. (Or, ya know… maybe just don't throw your boxers at a girl in general)""Her post in full can be seen below. And, a little detective work on the potential time/place of the chonie-tossing. There is a post from Nina dated Sept. 19, 2021, from her Insta that was shared to YouTube that references ""pants that got thrown at me a couple times today."" That sounds different than a single pair, but the timing would work out. Alice Cooper played Bridgeport, CT on Sept. 19 of last year, according to this schedule.  Plus, Nina, in the video, definitely looks like she just got done with a show. Check that out below too.We're anxiously awaiting new music from Strauss from her upcoming solo album that gave us ""Dead Inside,"" the track featuring David Draiman from Disturbed on vocals. Please refrain from hurling unmentionables at her until it's out. Or maybe just don't. Unless, as she notes in the video, ""they are clean and dry.""

Dietrich was on hand to chat with Drew Estates' JD, Willy, Pedro and Jack about the cigar and explained that this has been a secret he and the band have been sitting on for two years.Get our free mobile appBirthed while the country was experiencing mass shutdowns during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dietrich found himself smoking cigars with Hetfield fairly regularly. The more they hung out and smoked, the more this idea took shape. ""We hit it off in a lot of ways,"" Dietrich told the Drew Estate crew. ""We became very close. I knew this was a good opportunity and a possibility.""Dietrich pitched the idea of a Blackened cigar to Hetfield—""When I say 'pitched,' I just said, 'Wouldn't it be cool if we could make our own cigar?'""—and he was ecstatic about it. Dietrich took it to the whole band and they all loved it, too.""I've had the pleasure of being able to smoke the Blackened cigar and drink a Blackened cocktail at the same time,"" Dietrich explained. ""I gotta tell you, there's nothing better than that sweet and savory—the sweetness of the bourbon and the spiciness of the rye of our Blackened whiskey blend that balances well with the earthy notes, the chocolate notes of the Blackened cigar. I couldn't ask for a better pairing.""Blackened CigarBlackened American Whiskey and Drew Estate Cigarsloading...In a pre-recorded message, Hetfield joined the broadcast and shared his excitement about the new cigar.""I'm out here on the road, doing what I do best out here and enjoying a cigar at the same time,"" he said. In the official announcement shared by Cigar Aficionado, Hetfield added:It is really a fun social thing for me, a fellowship, to have a few buddies sit around with a few sticks. My buddy, Rob Dietrich, Blackened’s master distiller, and I frequently enjoy cigars together and he introduced me to Jonathan from Drew Estate. The three of us connected and shared each other’s vision and story about where we’ve been, what we like to see and what is important to us now, and we all came up with what a Blackened ‘M81’ cigar would look and taste like. I love the maduro leaf and I’m super excited for everyone to try this.As shared on Freestyle Live, the Blackened cigars should ship in 20-count boxes sometime in December and will come in four sizes; they'll cost about 10 dollars a stick. You can find a Drew Diplomat Retailer near you here, and if you happen to be at Cigar Aficionado's Big Smoke Las Vegas on Nov. 11-12, the Blackened cigars will be handed out throughout the event.This announcement comes on the heels of Blackened sharing their latest whiskey collaboration in the Masters of Whiskey series; you can read about Blackened X Wes Henderson here.Watch Freestyle Live Announce New Blackened CigarWhen we chatted with Dietrich earlier this year, he reminisced about his relationship with Hetfield and how it centered around the camaraderie of smoking cigars. ""I'm able to sit and smoke cigars with him and he'll ask me questions about it all,"" he said about Hetfield's genuine passion for the whiskey-making process.""I appreciate how much curiosity is there and how much [the whole band is] part of it.

Loudwire;Currents Guitarist Ryan Castaldi Diagnosed With Stage 3 Cancer;Find out how you can help with his medical costs.;"Currents have revealed that guitarist Ryan Castaldi has been diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer, and that a GoFundMe account has been set up to help the musician with his medical costs.According to a post, the musician was diagnosed in November of 2022 and started his treatment late last month. With at least two more years of treatment ahead, the GoFundMe fundraiser is seeking to raise $60,000 to help out with the guitarist's medial bills. Currents statement on the matter can be read in full below:Our dear friend and brother Ryan Castaldi has been diagnosed with Low-Grade Follicular Lymphoma, which is a non-Hodgkin's type of cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. He was diagnosed in November 2022.Six months prior to diagnosis, Ryan noticed a small lump in his armpit that slowly grew larger. A biopsy in October showed that it was indeed cancer. It is called ""low-grade follicular lymphoma because the abnormal cells are slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can go undiagnosed for years. The abnormal cells develop in clumps inside lymph nodes. This type of lymphoma is considered controllable, but not necessarily curable because it is slow growing.Ryan is currently in Stage 3 and the cancer was detected both above and below Ryan's diaphragm.Ryan began his treatment with Smilow Cancer Hospital Care Center at the end of December and his treatment includes both chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody. This treatment will last for six months followed by 2 years of maintenance monoclonal antibody treatment.Overall, the prognosis for Ryan is very favorable but it will be a long journey. During the first six months of treatment, Ryan will not be touring with Currents. If treatment goes well, Ryan is hoping to be back on tour with the band during the summer.Ryan has a very positive attitude and his outlook about his current situation but will truly miss touring and being on the road with his Currents family.All donations and support will go towards medical expenses (deductibles, co-pays, and maximum out-of-pocket expenses), treatments, and living expenses.Thank you in advance for all your generosity, prayers, and support for Ryan in his fight against cancer.He will beat this.Castaldi along with fellow guitarist Chris Wiseman are the longest tenured members of Currents, both having been with the band since 2014. He's worked on their two previous albums, as well as their most recent song ""The Death We Seek.""At press time, Castaldi's GoFundMe account has raised just shy of $20,000 with the proposed goal for $60,000. You can head here to make a donation.Currents are set to return to the road on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, with U.S. dates booked into mid-February.

Loudwire;Sid Wilson Names His Favorite Slipknot Song;It's not a popular one.;"A lot of artists hold most of their songs near and dear to their hearts, but that doesn't mean some of them don't have favorites. Slipknot's very own Sid Wilson even has a favorite, and it's not one you'd likely expect.During an interview with Revolver, Wilson noted that the Slipknot songs he loves the most are the ones they don't play often, but there is one in particular that he names as the cream of the crop.""My favorite tracks are always the ones that aren't played live,"" Wilson said. ""'Skin Ticket' [is] one of my all-time favorite songs. You listen to that song and you feel different after hearing that kind of stuff. You didn't know that that level of fear even existed in the world until you hear something like that. It takes you out of your everyday world to a super dark place.""""Skin Ticket"" is from 2001's Iowa, which is typically regarded as one of Slipknot's heaviest albums of all time — if not one of the heaviest albums of all time in general. According to Setlist.fm, it has been played live by the band, but only a handful of times — 14 to be exact — and the last time they performed it was in November of 2016 at Knotfest Japan. In fact, the last 13 times it was played was during 2016, and prior to that, the sole other time Slipknot had it in their set was in 2005.So, yes, Wilson's pick is a rare one, and would be quite nice to hear live again in the future.""I don't know why those are my favorite,"" the DJ continued in the interview. ""I don't know if it's just a reminder for me to stay on my toes all the time, and to strive to be that much better and try to help people in the world. Because [songs like 'Skin Ticket'] make it that real. Like, it's not a fantasy. That shit exists.

Loudwire;Type O Negative Reissuing Second Album With Original NSFW Scratch and Sniff Cover;But what does 'The Origin of the Feces' smell like?;"Type O Negative are digging into their past and preparing to give fans the first ever North American vinyl pressing of their sophomore set, The Origin of the Feces. But one thing that will make this classic set stand out even more is the scratch & sniff sticker that comes along with it.For those not familiar, ""Scratch N' Sniff"" first became popular in the 1970s, as stickers were applied to various media allowing the user to scratch them with the sticker then emitting a smell. One can only guess (and hopefully be wrong) what smell a sticker for an album titled The Origin of the Feces might emit.The new version also restores the original album's NSFW artwork as well, and fans will also receive the cover of the old reissue, Michael Wolgemut's ""The Dance of Death"" painting, as an 11"" X 17"" fold-out poster.This 8-track set is also notable for the addition of the band's cover of Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid,"" a song that was only added after the original version's initial reissue.And, as vinyl variants are all the rage, Brooklyn Vegan are offering ""smoke"" and ""skull gold"" options, complete with other various Type O merch options. Get your pre-orders in here.The Origin of the Feces was the band's second album, arriving in 1992.

Loudwire;Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx Marks 22 Years of Sobriety - 'One Hell of a Beautiful + Sometimes Difficult Journey';See what he had to say in marking the occasion.;"Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx marked a big occasion over the weekend and it had nothing to do with the upcoming holiday. Sixx revealed that he is 22 years sober on Sunday (July 2), sharing a post that details what has gone into what he called ""one hell of a beautiful and sometimes difficult journey.""""Today I turn 22 years clean and sober or 264.00 months. It has been one hell of [a] beautiful and sometimes difficult journey,"" started Sixx. ""People always say 'GOOD FOR YOU' like some kinda pat on my head. I do understand what they are trying to say. Truth is, nobody held my hand while I was kicking heroin, in fact nobody even called to even check on me. Nor did anybody hold by hair while I was vomiting blood. I had to make the decision alone to change my life but it wasn’t until I finally found the program that my life truly changed and I learned the tools for a beautiful life even in the face of adversity.That’s where I found people who understood my addiction.""The bassist continued, ""Obviously you have to want to do it for YOU but untangling the messy past takes more than willpower. People don’t always understand addiction. They think we have some kinda moral affliction when the truth is we are simply allergic to drink and drugs. You are not alone. Seek others out with some sober time under their belt who will understand where you’re at. Isn’t that what we need, to be understood?""""Sure we can blame it in our family ( etc ). My mom and dad failed me and I carried that pain til I almost killed myself but I also couldn’t see all the beauty around that I had growing up,"" he continued. ""My grandparents raised me and took care of me. I got to spend a lot of time in country. I’ll forever be in debt to their unconditional love. When you are ready there will be a spiritual awakening waiting for you. Simply admit you are powerless over drugs and alcohol (etc), otherwise your ego will kill YÖÜ. The beneficiaries are the people you love, plus the never ending joy of feeling alive in this short life.""Sixx continues his plea to those dealing with addiction issues, adding, ""Do it for you and pass it on to the people you love and those in need. Since I got sober I’ve had people try to stab me in the back, lie about me, steal from me and kick me in the nuts. Do you know how Ive been able to handle it? By STAYING sober. Sobriety gives you a chance to be strong yet also to do the next right thing. I don’t want a pat on the head or a good job Nikki. I would love to just pass this BEAUTIFUL message on to those in NEED of a positive program (AA) and the message of LOVE. For those still suffering there is hope. I am a work in progress. I still have work to do but I try to mitigate my life one day at a time. I love you. Love yourself back too. God bless.""Nikki Sixx Spreading the WordSixx has not only faced his own sobriety, he's been a leading advocate for helping others as well. In 2006, he shared his story in the book The Heroin Diaries, which spun off a new band for Sixx titled Sixx: A.M. and an accompanying soundtrack. The group went on to release five studio albums.In 2017, Sixx penned an op-ed piece for the Los Angeles Times decrying the opioid crisis in America.Sixx noted that overdoses kill more people than ""car crashes and gun homicides combined"" in the U.S. and that prescription opioids and heroin are the primary contributors to the overdoses. With the number of deaths from these drugs on the rise, the bassist also brought to light that many prescription drugs users often abandon the pharmaceuticals in favor of heroin because it is ""cheaper and easier to get than another refill.""Later in the op-ed, Sixx called on President Trump to heed the advice of his opioid commission, which submitted a report that ""emphasizes treatment, education about pain management for doctors, research and data collection and rational 'supply reduction.'"" He continued, ""It spells out policy goals based on facts and science. The president should listen to his own experts. Now.""Additionally, the rocker wanted drug manufacturers to be held accountable for their marketing tactics of addictive drugs, stating, ""We can better restrain painkiller prescriptions. Pharmaceutical companies are greedy and the regulations are too lax."" Worried about the message this sends to those struggling with addiction, Sixx commented, ""If we fail to take these necessary actions we are saying to addicts, 'You aren’t worth saving.' I am here to tell you that all addicts are worth saving.""READ MORE: 10 Rock Stars Who Got Sober + Stayed SoberLater that same year, Sixx teamed with the National Opioid Action Coalition to further bring attention to the epidemic by releasing the song ""Talk To Me."" Sixx, a board member for the Global Recovery Initiative Foundation, would take things a step further in 2021 with another new song titled ""Maybe It's Time"" featuring Slipknot's Corey Taylor, Def Leppard's Joe Elliott, country star Brantley Gilbert, Five Finger Death Punch's Ivan Moody, Slash and more under the moniker Sixx: A.M. Presents Artists for Recovery.

Loudwire;Viral Air-Drumming Slipknot Kid Plays 'Sulfur' on 'Ellen' TV Appearance;He got another shoutout from Jay Weinberg too.;"Do you remember the viral video clip of five-year-old Caleb Hayes air-drumming at a Slipknot show that circulated in early 2020? It caught the attention of Slipknot, who showered the little one with praise, and evidently the producers of The Ellen DeGeneres Show were impressed enough to invite the sensational drummer to play ""Sulfur"" on the daytime talk show.The plain fact that Slipknot's music is being played on such a program is almost unimaginable. The sheer aggression and heaviness of the band's music does not quite align with the presumed listening habits of Ellen's core viewing demographic and it's a sign of just how far heavy metal has come, especially music as extreme as Slipknot's. Perhaps as a collective society we have finally moved on past the tired ""Cookie Monster vocal"" bit and have come to realize that harsh vocals are a legitimate art form.Or, what's more likely, is that the viewers of Ellen are simply blown away by young kids with talent well beyond their years, which is the case with Hayes, who slayed it on TV.""My next guest is the cutest little drummer I have ever seen. All the way from Cumbria, England, please welcome seven-year-old Caleb Hayes,"" DeGeneres said, introducing the young drumming star.Outfitted with a leather jacket (the leather jacket frequently worn by metalheads for decades), the mohawk-rocking youngster put on a clinic for the live studio audience and viewers at home, playing ""Sulfur"" off Slipknot's 2008 album All Hope Is Gone.After his performance, he sat down next to DeGeneres for a brief interview, where he revealed he has been drumming since he was two years old. Unsurprisingly, he named Slipknot as his favorite band and, surprisingly, he said that thinking about chocolate helps distract him from the pressures of performing.Leading up to a big surprise, DeGeneres suggested that Hayes has been saving up for something special — a Jay Weinberg signature snare drum. ""Okay, well then we'll give it to you,"" the host told Hayes, who was in complete disbelief that he had been gifted the snare drum of his dreams.Weinberg even gave him a shoutout on Twitter and exclaimed, ""Once again, you've made all your big brothers in Slipknot proud! What a way to own the moment, and deliver a fantastic performance. So stoked to see you rip it up on The Ellen Show, and that you're heading home with a new SJC Drums snare.""Watch the full performance and interview further down the page.7-Year-Old Caleb Hayes Plays Slipknot's ""Sulfur"" on The Ellen DeGeneres ShowThe Evolution of Slipknot's Terrifying Masks";2022-03-03;https://loudwire.com/slipknot-kid-drummer-ellen-degeneres-show/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREVIRALAIR-DRUMMINGSLIPKNOTKIDPLAYS'SULFUR'ON'ELLEN'TVAPPEARANCE
Loudwire;Van Halen Classic Lineup Farewell Tour Was in the Works Before Eddie's Death, Says Nuno Bettencourt;Bettencourt recalls a moment in 2019 where EVH surprised him while he was recording for Extreme.;"In an interview with Tommy London on SiriusXM's Hair Nation, Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt revealed that Eddie Van Halen told him in 2019 that he was working on reuniting Van Halen's classic lineup for a farewell tour.The surface level ties between Bettencourt and the Van Halen camp are obvious — Gary Cherone, who has served as the only singer in Extreme, also fronted Van Halen for a brief period of 1996 through 1999 and was featured on the critical lowlight Van Halen III album that came out in 1998.Bettencourt, a more than worthy shredder in his own right, had a longstanding relationship with Eddie and there was a mutual level of respect between the two guitarists. Eddie even used to play a riff from Extreme's ""He-Man Woman Hater"" during soundcheck at Van Halen shows.Recollecting a moment from 2019 when he was recording a solo for the new Extreme song ""Rise,"" Bettencourt says on Hair Nation that Cherone kept trying to get a hold of him by calling and texting, insisting he come downstairs to see who had turned up to visit. It was Eddie Van Halen.READ MORE: See Photos of Guitar Legend Eddie Van Halen Through the YearsHe goes on to explain that Eddie began to play him and Cherone some of his son Wolfgang's new music, which has since been released as the first Mammoth WVH album. ""And [Eddie] was like a proud papa saying that [Wolfgang] played all the instruments and he did that and everything else,"" Bettencourt further recalls (transcription via Classic Rock).The conversation then shifted to the Van Halen band, where Bettencourt became privy to some exciting developments.Revealing that a classic lineup reunion was in the plans, the Extreme guitarist continues, ""And then he said something really cool, he was like, 'Hey, just between us, I'm like, I wanna let you know, like Van Halen's coming back and we gonna go out the way we came with Michael. We're planning a run, and we're gonna go out the way we came in like a farewell tour, but like, do it old school.'""Bettencourt's sentiments at the time were that this was ""way overdue"" and also noted that Wolfgang, who played bass in Van Halen since 2006, was the one reaching out to classic bass player Michael Anthony.In late 2020, Wolfgang had said on The Howard Stern Show that his father was plotting a ""kitchen sink"" tour, with considerations for not only having Anthony return to the fold, but for also having singers David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar and Cherone all onstage.""If only things had been better, it would have been amazing,"" Wolfgang said at the time.Listen to the interview clip further down the page.The aforementioned ""Rise"" is one of the new tracks on Extreme's forthcoming album, Six, which comes out on June 9 through earMUSIC. Head to the band's website for more album details and to see all of their upcoming tour dates.Wolfgang, meanwhile, will release Mammoth II, the second Mammoth WVH album, on Aug. 4. The group is currently on the road with Metallica and will later embark on a tour with Alter Bridge and Sevendust.Nuno Bettencourt, SiriusXM Hair Nation InterviewBands Who Had Final Tours That Weren’t FinalWhether due to interpersonal turmoil, the desire to pursue other creative endeavors and/or something else, here are 10 acts who – intentionally or not – announced final tours that, well, weren’t actually final.";2023-04-28;https://loudwire.com/van-halen-planned-classic-lineup-farewell-tour-says-nuno-bettencourt/;2023-04-30;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREVANHALENCLASSICLINEUPFAREWELLTOURWASINTHEWORKSBEFOREEDDIE'SDEATH,SAYSNUNOBETTENCOURT
Loudwire;Red Hot Chili Peppers Get Their 'Star' on the Hollywood Walk of Fame;Watch video of the ceremony.;"UPDATE: Red Hot Chili Peppers indeed received their ""star"" on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday (March 31). Watch a video of the ceremony down toward the bottom of this post, via Variety, underneath the original story about the honor.Red Hot Chili Peppers will soon get a hometown honor that's long overdue as the band will receive their ""star"" on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.According to Variety, a ceremony has been set for Thursday, March 31 at 11:30AM PT in which the latest star, the 2,717th overall, will be added to the Walk of Fame in Hollywood. The Chili Peppers star will be located in the second row at 6212 Hollywood Boulevard, adjacent to the Amoeba Records location on the south side of the street.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band's star will neighbor those of TV producer Harry Friedman, Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak and legendary talk show host Jack Paar.The ceremony will kick off with iconic funk artist George Clinton, who produced the band's 1985 Freaky Styley album, doing the honors of unveiling the star alongside actor Woody Harrelson, fellow musician Bob Forrest and Hollywood Chamber of Commerce chair and emcee for the ceremony Nicole Mihalka.It's been a long journey for Red Hot Chili Peppers to get to this point. The band famously formed when they were still in high school just a few city streets away from where their star is located at Fairfax High School. Anthony Kiedis and Flea were part of the original group alongside the late Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. These days, Kiedis and Flea are flanked by John Frusciante and Chad Smith.“Our hometown Hollywood boys are finally coming to collect their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,” stated Hollywood Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez. “We have been waiting for them to break away from their busy schedules to dedicate their star, and we are thrilled to welcome them to our Walk of Fame family.”Speaking of busy schedules, the band has a new album, Unlimited Love, set to drop on April 1 with a major world tour to follow. The group has already released the songs ""Black Summer"" and ""Poster Child"" from the upcoming set. And the band is already said to be working on their follow-up album.

After many years on the road, with the subsequent stress and tiredness that accompany long tour schedules, Paul doesn't want his performance to suffer and let his fellow bandmates and fans down.Paul will continue to record with the band and may play select special shows in the future.Saxon stand by Paul's decision and will keep you all informed regarding our next journey.The current run of March shows in Europe will continue as is but the band will be cancelling their April dates in South America and the MOR Cruise to give time to re-group.

In their first film they did America. This time: Their target is nothing less than the entire universe.The poster for this new Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe boldly declares it “The Dumbest Science Fiction Movie Ever Made.” We’ll see about that. What about Mac and Me? That was pretty darn bad.The trailer for Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe certainly doesn’t look terrible; it seems pretty funny, and sees Beavis and Butt-Head venturing into outer space and then into spoofs of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar and even Marvel’s What If...? (The sight of Beavis and Butt-head as Uatu the Watcher is not something I ever expected to see outside of my nightmares). Their journey beyond the stars sends them from their old home in the 1990s, when Mike Judge’s dopey teenagers first debuted on MTV, into the 2020s, where they can make fun of modern culture. God knows we deserve it.Take a look at the first teaser below:As always, franchise creator Mike Judge is back voicing both title characters; he both wrote and directed this new streaming movie for Paramount+. Here is its official synopsis:In perhaps the dumbest space movie ever made, Beavis and Butt-head are sentenced to Space Camp by a ""creative"" judge in 1998, leading to a trip on the Space Shuttle, with predictably disastrous results.

Loudwire;The Truth About Anxiety from Eva Under Fire's Eva Marie;Eva Under Fire's Eva Marie delves into anxiety as part of this Mental Health Awareness Month series.;"Anxiety is but a normal part of life, something that many deal with in their everyday life. That general sense of fear, dread and uneasiness can creep up on you causing a bit of panic, often brought on by the stress or concern over a certain situation. But have you ever delved into what your anxiety means and how you can be better able to control it?May is Mental Health Awareness Month and a great time to take stock of how your dealing with your own mental health, what role you can play in developing your mental health conditioning and what practices you can pursue to maintain a good mental health outlook. With this in mind, we've connected with Eva Under Fire's Eva Marie, who when not fronting her up-and-coming rock band has been licensed as an outpatient psychotherapist, primarily working in the areas of anxiety, depression, grief and substance abuse recovery.Given her expertise in these areas, Eva has graciously agreed to pen this Loudwire column throughout Mental Health Awareness month, putting a spotlight on specific mental health issues and providing some tips on how you can help cope with each. We start this series with a closer look at anxiety, with Eva sharing one of her own personal experiences with anxiety and what she's learned in how to deal with it. Take it away, Eva!It was our first big tour. As the opening band, we had just loaded all our gear on stage. Our gear was new but we practiced with it and felt prepared. We got a full sound check. The previous popping sounds we were getting from the PA the day before were fixed by changing out a bad cable. Or so we thought...Fast forward to actual showtime. The fans have arrived and everyone is waiting for us to take the stage. But our gear won’t turn on. I mean, LITERALLY the whole stage box blew and we had nothing. No wireless signal, no click track, no in ear monitors... that means guitars, drums, and vocals were all affected. Worst of all, we were delaying the start of the entire show trying to scramble and figure it out.That was my first professional moment of panic. I had worked my entire life for this opportunity and now, none of the gear was working. There wasn’t a thing I could do about it. It could have gotten us removed from the show. Worst case, we could have gotten fired from the tour! Do you want to know what happened instead?The headlining band Skillet's production manager looked me in the eyes and said, “Breathe. This is what tour life looks like sometimes. It’s happened to all of us. We’ll get it figured out”. Then Adelitas Way, the support band playing after us, said, “Here, use our gear. That way you guys will still get to play!” (Have I mentioned that I absolutely LOVE my rock community?)The world isn’t fair. There’s a lot of pressure to fix things that we can’t even control, but I promise if you surround yourself with people who have your back, there’s less to worry about. Messing up doesn’t mean the world is going to fall apart. Fear is lying to you. Here’s the truth about anxiety.Having Peace Is Not a Circumstance, It’s a MindsetThis can be hard to learn as you move through life finding yourself in new environments with new experiences that are unfamiliar to you. Fear of the unknown. This is where we have to trust in what we do know: Ourselves. Positive affirmations can help! Examples: I am smart. I’ll figure it out. I got this far, so I can keep going...*deep breath* Ready? Last one... ASKING FOR HELP IS OKAY. There. I said it.10 Second RuleSpeaking of deep breathing, there are breathing exercises that not only calm your nerves, but can actually reset brain chemistry. Inhale for 10 seconds, hold for one beat, then exhale for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times. There is another technique called “4-7-8 Breathing”. I’ve included the link for you.Coping with Anxiety AttacksSometimes, anxiety is not situational and there isn’t a clear trigger to point to. Ever feel like anxiety hits you out of nowhere? Your brain is misfiring. Somewhere along the way, your brain saw, heard or felt something and registered it as threatening. It’s a reaction, not something you consciously think about. Don’t worry: This fear response can also be unlearned.Though it can be frustrating not understanding why you’re feeling what you’re feeling (Heart racing, sweaty palms, blurred vision, brain fog), mindfulness can help you talk to your body in the present moment and get it to calm down. Waiting it out, honoring what you’re feeling, talking with someone about it, speaking out loud or into a mirror to assure yourself of your safety may help.If triggers are too numerous or too intense to think through, you might ask your physician about anxiety medication. Not all meds are habit forming and sometimes even low dose medication can help your body’s fear response to be less intense. Less intense anxiety/fear response means more access to your critical thinking skills and reasoning ability so we can stop coping and start healing. I highly recommend anyone who takes medication for anxiety or depression also be active in psychotherapy. The meds are helping your body maintain a healthier physiological baseline, but they’re not helping you learn about or process emotions for long term healing.Cultivating a strong sense of self and healthy, supportive relationships is important for security. It begins by assuming good things about yourself and the world around you. Once you can look forward to good times, and be confident that you can get through the bad times, liberation from fear is possible.Much Love,EvaOther Resources""F*ck Coping, Start Healing"" Book""4-7-8 Breathing""Recommended Cathartic Playlist:From Ashes to New, ""Panic""Wage War, ""Manic""Bring Me The Horizon featuring YUNGBLUD, ""Obey""Ice Nine Kills, ""Rainy Day""Eva Under Fire featuring Spencer Charnas, ""Blow""Evanescence, ""Going Under""Paramore, ""Emergency""Nine Inch Nails, ""Hurt""Seether, ""Words as Weapons""Story of the Year, ""Anthem of Our Dying Day""A Perfect Circle, ""Weak and Powerless""Our thanks to Eva Under Fire's Eva Marie for this first in her series of Loudwire columns for Mental Health Awareness Month.

The only way we are able to help all is because of you.”Having returned to the stage in 2021 after a pandemic lockdown, TSO music director and lead guitarist Al Pitrelli stated, “It was so special to be back playing live last year. When you love something as much as we do and it's taken away, it made us super thankful to be back. I look forward to seeing all our ‘repeat offenders’ and all our new friends when we hit the road.""He adds, “I love all of Paul’s stories, but The Ghosts of Christmas Eve is one of my favorites and can’t wait to unveil this incredibly amazing new show for everyone. We know some people may be having tough times, so we worked hard with the local promoters and arenas to have a low priced $29 ticket to do our part in helping out.

Loudwire;Travis Barker Shares Graphic Update Following Surgery for Injured Finger;Blink-182 had to postpone tour dates because of it.;"Last week, Blink-182 announced the postponement of the first leg of their reunion tour with Tom DeLonge due to multiple injuries that Travis Barker sustained to his finger. The drummer underwent surgery to repair the finger a few days later, and has since shared an update on social media regarding how it went.In early February, the rocker revealed that he dislocated one of his fingers and tore the ligaments after accidentally smashing it during a band rehearsal. A few weeks later, it happened again, and he posted the X-rays on his Instagram. As a result, he announced he was going to need surgery to repair the damage, and thus, Blink's shows that were set to take place in Mexico and South America between March 11 and April 2 were canceled.Get Blink-182 Tickets HereBarker underwent surgery last week, and fortunately provided a positive update on social media on March 3.“Thank you for all the love and prayers and understanding this week as I went into surgery. It was a hard decision to make but ultimately I couldn’t continue to play the drums without it,"" Barker wrote on Instagram.""It was inevitable that my finger would have dislocated again without fixing the torn ligament surgically. So grateful for Dr. Shin and that my surgery was a success so that I can keep doing what I love and see you guys on tour soon,"" he continued, adding a trigger warning for the last photo in the slide.READ MORE: New Blink-182 Album 'Coming in a Few Months,' Tom DeLonge SaysSee a screenshot below, and check the post out here for yourself to see both images.Blink-182's tour is now set to kick off May 4 in St. Paul, Minn.

Loudwire;Behold the Rush Pinball Machine in All Its Glory;A first look at the game has now emerged.;"A Rush pinball machine based on the Canadian prog-rock heroes is on the way from Stern Pinball, as was announced by the game maker last week. But now (as of Jan. 4), a video showing the game has emerged.Indeed, Rush fans into vintage gaming will soon be able to roll the bones with the caress of a steel ball. Just like an anachronistic, arcade-dwelling Tom Sawyer.Are you ready to try your hand at Rush pinball?Watch the video down toward the bottom of this post.In an earlier teaser video that had yet to reveal the machine, song titles including ""Bastille Day,"" ""Fly by Night,"" ""Limelight"" and ""Working Man"" appeared onscreen, indicating the Rush tunes that will likely be used in the game celebrating the rock group.Stern Pinball is related to its 1970s and '80s pinball predecessor, Stern Electronics, who had early arcade hits with games such as Stampede, Hot Hand, Quicksilver, Flight 2000 and others. Stern Pinball has previously made machines based on bands such as AC/DC, Iron Maiden, KISS, Led Zeppelin and Metallica, as well as for movies, TV and more.Rush, who formed in 1968 and released 19 studio albums during their time together, stopped performing in 2018. Drummer Neil Peart died from brain cancer two years later. Earlier this year, guitarist Alex Lifeson said he's probably done with extensive touring. Bassist-vocalist Geddy Lee has started on his memoir.Last month, a collaborative song emerged featuring Lifeson with Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and Metallica shredder Kirk Hammett. In October, the Ohio State University Marching Band paid tribute to Rush's music during a football game.Find out more about Rush pinball at sternpinball.com.

Loudwire;President Biden Issues Call to 'Crack Down' on 'Hidden Junk' Fees for Concerts + More;Probably one of the least divisive agendas in politics right now.;"Even President Joe Biden is tired of hidden fees, especially when it comes to concerts, and he has now requested his administration work to eliminate these fees from the purchasing experience.We've all been there — you scout the seating map, put a couple of tickets in your cart and by the time you've reached the checkout page, suddenly the total price has jumped quite a bit higher than the original listed price indicated you'd be paying.There's oftentimes multiple fees associated with a purchase and, sometimes, you even have to pay to print out a ticket in your own home, from your own computer with your own printer, paper and ink, connected through the internet you pay for.On Twitter, President Biden followed up his Oct. 26 speech, which broached this topic, by saying these ""hidden junk fees"" are a ""pain,"" adding that they're ""unfair, deceptive and add up.""His hope is that his administration can resolve one of the most common complaints associated with the user experience of buying tickets, as well as other goods and services in order to ""put that money back in your pocket."" Other hidden/junk fees include ""surprise banking overdraft fees, excessive credit card late fees, hidden hotel booking fees, or those huge termination charges to stop you from switching cable and Internet plans to a better deal.""""Last week, the Federal Trade Commission started work on a rule to crack down on unfair and deceptive fees across all industries, fees that were never disclosed — never disclosed. And there was no way to avoid the fee, like processing fees for concert tickets or like resort fees. When you think you’re paying one price to book a hotel, you only find out after checking out that there’s a 'resort fee' you never heard about that’s added to your bill,"" said the President in part of that speech.Of course, with concert ticket prices now ranging between a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars quite regularly, who is to say these fees won't simply be added to the original advertised price rather than eliminated altogether? In previous years (when $100 per concert ticket was more of a rarity than the standard), that fee sometimes added an additional 10 to 20 percent of the original ticket cost (and a larger percentage regarding lesser ticket prices).Now, that same monetary fee makes up a smaller percentage of the ticket price, therefore it, theoretically is not as big of a purchase deterrent.The President is not the only active member of the U.S. government to take issue with the current concert experience, from purchasing a ticket to attending events. U.S. representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey issued a public call for the anti-monopolistic breakup of Live Nation, the global concert promoter that also owns Ticketmaster and countless venues.""About 200 deaths and 750 injuries occurred at Live Nation events since 2006,"" Pascrell told New York Post earlier this year, demanding the company be held accountable ""just like any other business.""Artists Who Tried Their Best to Combat Scummy Concert Ticket Practices";2022-11-04;https://loudwire.com/joe-biden-crack-down-fees-concert-tickets/;2022-11-06;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREPRESIDENTBIDENISSUESCALLTO'CRACKDOWN'ON'HIDDENJUNK'FEESFORCONCERTS+MORE
Loudwire;David Gilmour’s Wife Takes Pink Floyd Feud to New Level, Blasts Roger Waters as ‘Antisemetic,’ ‘Misogynistic’ + A Lot, Lot More;Polly Samson went OFF on Roger Waters.;"The schism between Pink Floyd legends David Gilmour and Roger Waters has just been taken to a new extreme after Gilmour backed his wife Polly Samson's tweet condemning Waters as ""antisemitic to your rotten core,"" ""misogynistic"" and a whole lot more. It also prompted a light response from the estranged bassist.Yesterday (Feb. 6), Samson (a journalist and novelist who married Gilmour in 1994 and has contributed to Pink Floyd releases) tweeted at Waters:Sadly, @rogerwaters you are antisemitic to your rotten core. Also, a Putin apologist and a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoidong, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy, megalomaniac. Enough of your nonsense.Gilmour then retweeted Samson's message and said, ""Every word demonstrably true.""Samson's message appears to be spurred by something Waters posted one day earlier (Feb. 5) where he tweeted a link to an interview with German newspaper Berliner Zeitung on his own website in response to the ""Israeli Lobby trying to cancel my 85 percent SOLD OUT series of concerts in Germany.""In the tweet, he wrote:THE TRUTH WILL SET US FREEAgainst the backdrop of the outrageous and despicable smear campaign by the ISRAELI LOBBY to denounce me as an ANTI-SEMITE, WHICH I AM NOT, NEVER HAVE BEEN and NEVER WILL BE.Acknowledging Samson's message, the bassist shared an image with text laid over it, calling the ""incendiary"" claims ""wildly inaccurate"" while declaring uncertainty as to how to proceed.The full response reads:Roger Waters is aware of the incendiary and wildly inaccurate comments made about him on Twitter by Polly Samson which he refutes entirely. He is currently taking advice as to his position.In recent years in particular, Waters has come under increasing scrutiny for his political outlook and other related world views.In June of 2019, Disturbed frontman David Draiman (who since returning to Twitter early last year has used his platform to raise awareness for rampant antisemitism worldwide) called out Waters and ""his Nazi comrades"" over their support for the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions).The movement's website states, ""The PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization], the BDS movement and Palestinian civil society and human rights organizations issue a historic call to intensify global pressure to dismantle Israel's regime of settler-colonialism and apartheid.""Draiman described the BDS as a movement as something predicated on ""a special hatred that exists for the Jewish people in this world.""The singer later went on to accuse Waters of sympathizing with leaders of socialist and communist regimes.""This is a guy who just celebrated getting a gift of a guitar from Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, for god's sake — one of the most brutal dictators in the world, who has been massacring his own people, starving his own people,"" Draiman cited after calling Waters a ""very sick man"" for his opposition to the BDS movement.More recently, in September of last year, Waters penned an open letter to Olena Zelenska, First Lady of Ukraine and wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urging the country to negotiate a peaceful ceasefire while condemning western nations for supplying arms to Ukrainian fighters. She, in turn, challenged Waters to ask Russian President Vladimir Putin for peace, which resulted in Waters issuing an open letter to Putin.In this letter, Waters echoed concerns of other nations that Russia's war against Ukraine has potential spill over to more hostile invasions of nearby countries and, if so, ""fuck you [to Putin]."" He immediately followed up this comment with a shoulder-shrugging attitude that all is lost and the world's leading powers ""might as well all stop playing the desperately dangerous game of nuclear chicken that the hawks on both sides of the Atlantic seem so comfortable with, and have at it. Yup, just blow each other and the world to smithereens.""Acknowledging this outcome is not ideal, Waters then expressed concern his his children and grandchildren, so it would instead just be better to not end the world with apocalyptic devastation.He again took a cynical attitude toward NATO and the U.S., asking Putin to hammer out a binding agreement that would prevent him from invading another country ever again. ""I know, I know, the USA and NATO invade other sovereign countries at the drop of a hat, or a few barrels of oil, but that doesn't mean you should,"" while noting the ""heinous war of aggression"" waged against Ukraine took him by surprise while leaving the door open that Russia was perhaps provoked into launching the offensive.Shortly after posting this open letter, Waters claimed his name is ""on a kill list supported by the Ukrainian government."" In that same interview where those claims were made, he also denied evidence of war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine and came to the country's defense.“You’ve seen it on what I’ve just described to you as western propaganda. It’s exactly the obverse of saying, Russian propaganda, Russians interfered with our election, Russians did that. It’s all lies, lies, lies, lies,"" Waters argued, despite the federal grand jury's 2018 indictment of 11 Russian military intelligence officers ""for their alleged roles in interfering with the 2016 United States (U.S.) election.As a result of these actions, it has been rumored that Waters jeopardized a $500 million deal for the sale of Pink Floyd's catalog rights to one of several bidders, such as Sony Music, Warner Music, BMG, Primary Wave and Hipgnosis Songs Capital.Musicians Who Ran for Political OfficeThese rockers not only made music, but also wanted to make a difference in the world.20 Artists Who Told Politicians to Stop Using Their MusicPoliticians are consistently using songs by bands without their permission, and these artists had enough of it.";2023-02-07;https://loudwire.com/pink-floyd-david-gilmour-backs-wife-polly-samson-tweet-blasting-roger-waters/;2023-02-08;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREDAVIDGILMOUR’SWIFETAKESPINKFLOYDFEUDTONEWLEVEL,BLASTSROGERWATERSAS‘ANTISEMETIC,’‘MISOGYNISTIC’+ALOT,LOTMORE

It's sold 30 million copies worldwide, and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.

Loudwire;Former '120 Minutes' Host Lewis Largent Dies at 58, Rockers + Fellow Journalists Pay Tribute;R.I.P.;"Lewis Largent, influential rock radio DJ and former host of MTV’s 120 Minutes, has died at 58. Endearingly, numerous friends and fans – including some rock artists and fellow MTV alumni – have since honored the beloved industry personality online.Variety reports – via a family source – that Largent died on Feb. 20, 2023 “after a long illness.” To date, no further details have been given regarding the exact cause or location of his death.Raised in Southern California, Largent got his first big break in the music industry in the mid-80s, when he befriended the general manager of Los Angeles alternative rock radio station KROQ. (During that time, Variety adds, Largent was “an enthusiastic golfer” who met the man while working at a country club.) Before long, Largent got an internship at the station that led to a permanent job in 1985. By 1989, he was named KROQ’s Music Director.In 1992, he left KROQ to take a position as a Vice President of Music Programming at MTV, as well as the host of the network’s signature Sunday night show, 120 Minutes. Over the next three years, he became one of the network’s most well-known personalities, bringing revered artists such as David Bowie, Trent Reznor, PJ Harvey, Radiohead, Björk and Pavement to audiences across the nation.Although he left 120 Minutes in 1995 – and was replaced by Matt Pinfield, The Los Angeles Times notes – he stayed at MTV until 1999 (where he was eventually promoted to Vice President of Music and Artist Development).Afterward, he was named a Senior Vice President of A&R at Island Def Jam Records.

Loudwire;38 Years Ago: Metallica Release ‘Ride the Lightning’;How would Metallica follow up 'Kill 'Em All'? On July 27, 1984, we got 'Ride the Lightning.';"After Metallica’s debut, Kill ‘Em All, became a template for a new style of music, the band realized it was going to have to up the ante on thrash metal. Slayer had released their blinding debut Show No Mercy. Anthrax put out Fistful of Metal and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett’s original band, Exodus, had a hot underground demo with a similar sound. As they worked on songs for their second album, Metallica were determined to stay ahead of the pack, and when Ride the Lightning came out on July 27, 1984, they proved that they weren’t just one of the best thrash bands, they were one of the best bands, period.Guitarist James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich had written most of Metallica’s first album with Dave Mustaine. Since Mustaine was no longer in the group when the sessions for Ride the Lightning began, bassist Cliff Burton stepped to the forefront, contributing to six of the eight songs and encouraging his bandmates to experiment with different tempos and structures on songs like “Fight Fire With Fire"" and the cinematic instrumental “The Call of Ktulu.”Metallica, ""Fight Fire With Fire""Like Iron Maiden’s Steve Harris, who was one of Metallica’s musical heroes, Burton played with his fingers, imbuing the songs with fluidity. Since he had some knowledge of music theory, he showed Hetfield and Hammett how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked. He also enhanced the music with effect pedals, including the Morley wah-wah, which provided a sweeping, cutting sound under the metallic crunch.“I think Cliff was the one who really taught them about melody,” adds Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian. “Cliff was the maestro. He was really accomplished and was thinking beyond thrash and metal. He always wore an R.E.M. t-shirt and a Lynyrd Skynyrd pin on his jean jacket and I think that gives you an idea of where his head was at.”“Ride the Lightning gave Cliff a platform to shine as a songwriter and a player,” said Metal Mania fanzine founder and KUSF Ramgate Radio DJ Ron Quintana. “He could do it all. He gave Metallica many more options than just playing fast. He loved complex music. He listened to classical, Frank Zappa and it showed in his bass playing.”In addition to burning with energy and creativity, Metallica were also extremely hungry -- literally. They were renting a house, which they called the Metallimansion, in El Cerrito, Calif., but they could barely pay their rent and they had to choose carefully between spending money on cheap eats or budget beer and liquor.“Everyone was so poor, we were lucky if we could afford Smirnoff,” Quintana told me in 2014. “And anyone who would bring good, hard alcohol was worshipped. It was such a small house. You’d walk up the little front stairs and there was a small deck. And then inside to the right was the famous couch everyone would crash on in the main living room. And then to the left were two rooms, which is where Lars and James lived.”“Before I went over there for the first time I thought it was going to be this really nice place,” early band photographer and current D.R.I. bassist Harald Oimoen told me in 2014. “Of course, it was the furthest thing from that you could imagine -- a total dive. They practiced out in the back in a one-car garage that barely had enough room for a car. At one point, they had to line the ground with milk crates and stand on those because whenever it rained, the water leaked in and they didn’t want to get electrocuted.”Metallica, ""Creeping Death""It was in these cramped quarters that Metallica grew exponentially as players and songwriters and wrote some of their most heralded songs. Three months before they headed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to record Ride the Lightning, they were already playing unpolished versions of “Creeping Death,” the title track, “Fight Fire With Fire” and “The Call of Ktulu” in concert. Then, the night before a show at The Channel in Boston on January 24, 1984, someone broke into Metallica’s van and stole Ulrich’s drum kit, Hammett’s Marshall head cabinet and Hetfield’s modified Marshall head cabinet and speaker. Anthrax leant the band equipment for the remaining dates of the tour, so Metallica were still able to play the shows, but that didn’t cure the sting from losing their gear, especially for Hetfield.Dejected by the robbery, Metallica’s frontman write a melancholy, arpeggiated melody on an acoustic guitar and penned his most vulnerable, despairing lyrics to date. “Life it seems will fade away, drifting further every day / Getting lost within myself / Nothing matters no one else / I have lost the will to live.” Coupled with the delicate guitar passage, Hetfield’s seven-minute long ode to suicide became Metallica’s first ballad, “Fade to Black.”“I’m sure I wasn’t really thinking of killing myself,” he said in Birth School Metallica Death. “But it was my favorite Marshall amp, man!”Metallica, ""Fade to Black""Metallica wrote the remaining three songs on Ride the Lightning, “Escape,” “Trapped Under Ice,” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark with producer Flemming Rasmussen. The band’s manager Jonny Z chose the place because it was affordable and the band liked it because Rainbow had recorded Difficult to Cure there. Since their amps had been stolen in Boston, Metallica brought over their guitars and Rasmussen hooked them up with nine Marshalls he borrowed from Danish bands that were in town.“[We] spent the first day testing them,” he told Rolling Stone. ""We actually recreated James' guitar sound on Kill 'Em All, but just beefed it up. He was really pleased with that.”With the amp problem solved, Rasmussen discovered a much more vexing issue. Ulrich played inventive drum fills, for sure, but when he tried to keep a straight beat for a prolonged period of time he would speed up for some parts and slow down for others. “I thought he was absolutely useless [at first],” Rasmussen told Enter Night writer Mick Wall. “The very first thing I asked when he started playing was, ‘Does everything start on an upbeat?’ And he went, ‘What’s an upbeat?’”With the help of drum roadie Flemming Larsen, Rasmussen gave Ulrich a crash course in basic drumming. “We started telling him about [beats] -- that they have to be an equal length of time between that hit, that hit and that hit and you have to be able to count to four before you come in again.” Rasmussen said.Fortunately, Ulrich was a quick learner and, while some songs required more takes than others, Rasmussen was eventually able to track the drums at the right tempo without the aid of computer programs like ProTools, which had yet to be invented. Rasmussen also contributed creatively to the recording, using backwards guitar atop normal melody lines on songs like “Fade to Black” and the intro to “Fight Fire with Fire.” The creativity in the studio was infectious. Burton came up with the squiggly, descending bass pattern for “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and for the bell tones at the end of the song, Ulrich struck an anvil with a metal hammer.In mid-March, when Metallica listened to the completed album, they were pleased at the quality and diversity of the recording. While “Fade to Black” was a standout melodic single, from the start it was clear that “Creeping Death” was a real highlight. “I sat in the control room after we did the [‘Die, die, die’] gang vocals [for the song] and everyone was going nuts,” Hetfield told Guitar World.Metallica, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""Elektra Records signed Metallica on Sept. 12 and re-released Ride the Lightning on Nov. 19. Four days later, they released a 12-inch for “Creeping Death,” which featured covers of “Am I Evil?” by Diamond Head and “Blitzkrieg” by Blitzkrieg. Ride the Lightning peaked at No. 100 on the Billboard album chart, and even without a music video or radio airplay, the band grew rapidly and organically. Some old-school fans felt betrayed by melodic songs like “Escape” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” but many more open-minded listeners applauded the diversity and new listeners who didn’t follow thrash were drawn to “Fade to Black.”“One of the first moments when I realized things were really happening for us happened when I was at my girlfriend’s house right when Ride the Lightning came out,” Hetfield stated in Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal. “I was waiting for her while her sister was home, and I don’t think she knew I was there, and I could hear ‘Fade to Black’ blasting out of her speakers in her bedroom. It’s like, no one was there to hear her listen to that. She was listening to that because she liked it and it spoke to her. That was a pretty big thing for me. You know, ‘Fade to Black’ was one of those pivotal songs for us where you had the hardcore fan that said, ‘Screw you, you sold out, you did a ballad.’ That was their simplistic thinking. Then you had the other people that said, ‘Wow no one had ever spoken to me like that in a song and I totally relate to that and it’s helped me.’”To date, Ride the Lightning has shipped six million copies in the U.S. and more than half the album's tracks -- “Ride the Lightning,” ""Creeping Death,"" “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “Fade to Black” -- remain staples of the band’s live set.Metallica, ""Ride the Lightning""Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;8 Times Musicians Were Credited on Albums They Didn't Actually Play On;Mind = Blown;It’s not unusual for musicians to secretly play on other people’s music.Just look at Jimmy Page covertly backing up guitarist Pete Townshend on The Who’s “I Can’t Explain,” Jack White singing as John S. O’Leary on Electric Six’s “Danger! High Voltage” and much – if not all – of what The Wrecking Crew did in the 1960s and 70s.What’s less often conceded is someone being credited for performing on an album without, you know, actually doing it.Maybe they joined a band after their latest record was completed yet they still wanted to be seen as a part of the group? Maybe there was some contractual obligation to give them false recognition? Or, maybe the artist simply wanted to fool fans for their own amusement?Whatever the reason, it’s an intriguingly sneaky thing to do, as the entries on this list demonstrate.  Granted, some of them are more debatable and speculative than others, but each one is a fascinating part of the band's history.READ MORE: 12 Stories Behind the People on Iconic Rock + Metal Album Covers8 Times Musicians Were Credited on Albums They Didn't Actually Play OnMind = Blown.

Loudwire;We Went Bigfoot Hunting With Sleep / High on Fire's Matt Pike;Was Pike able to mate with the female Sasquatch? Click to find out.;Sleep / High on Fire riff lord Matt Pike has just released his debut solo album, Pike vs. the Automaton. To celebrate another batch of filthy tunes from the stoner metal king, we ventured into the woods to search for the elusive creature known as Bigfoot.If you watch Pike’s new video for “Alien Slut Mum,” you’ll see that it’s filled with infamous cryptids which may or may not exist. To get a closer look at some of those mysterious creatures, we started off visiting the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium in Portland, Oregon, where we stood toe-to-toe with a life-sized Bigfoot, stuck Pike’s head into an alien autopsy scene and read the riff lord his fortune.When we asked Pike what his dream cryptid encounter would be, he said, “I’ve already encountered lizard people [but] I’d probably have to say, like a toddler, Bigfoot … I know I’ve been in the forest with Bigfoot. I’ll drive my fuckin’ Jeep in the middle of the woods where there’s no fire road — where it’s terrifying. If you’re in the woods and it gets silent, that means there’s a predator.”Thankfully, the Peculiarium had just what we needed to make Pike’s dream come true — an official Bigfoot Research Kit. With our kit in hand and a Nature Valley granola bar for bait, we drove deep into the woods of Oregon, planting Bigfoot Evidence flags into Sasquatch scat, crafting traps, hitting our knocking sticks against tree trunks and blasting Bigfoot mating calls into the forest. Pike even readied himself to mate in case our Sasquatch was a female.Did we finally prove Bigfoot’s existence beyond any shadow of a doubt?

Having leaned a poppier direction in recent years, the band drops a cautionary tale called ""Dinosaur"" that delivers with plenty of rock swagger while serving as a warning call for the human race.Singer Tyler Connolly belts out his prediction in the lyrics, “Hey kids, boys and girls / Now we’ve really done it, it’s the end of the world / Now, we’re going out, going out like the dinosaur."" While that's definitely a darker sentiment, the music accompanying that thought is anything but, with the band utilizing a catchy swing to deliver that feeling of this being a more celebratory end.“‘Dinosaur’ takes us back to our roots with this riff-driven rocker,” shares Connolly. “To me, it feels like it could fit on any of our albums, but I will say if you like the old Theory of a Deadman, you’ll love the new Theory of a Deadman.”“Rock is where we made our bed for all these years,” adds guitarist Dave Brenner. “It’s been a while since we had an up-tempo in-your-face track like this – and it felt good.”At present, ""Dinosaur"" is a stand-alone single, coming clearly after the promotion of the band's 2020 album, Say Nothing. It also feels more on the harder rock side of the band's sound, with energetic guitars pulsing through your speakers.The track was produced by Martin Terefe, and it's possible this could eventually lead to the announcement of their next album. But for now, take a closer look at the lyrics and listen to the song below, while you can now pick up the track here. The band also recently debuted the track live during their appearance at Aftershock 2022 in Sacramento, Fan-shot footage of that performance can be viewed below.Theory of a Deadman, ""Dinosaur"" LyricsWhatever happened to humanityYa we’ve driven ourselves to insanityWe all human waste in a race to the finishNow we know that we’re all gonna get itDo something stupid like some dumb ass kidsHiding in the dark hunting down our friendsWe all Lord of the flies till the very endNow we know that we’re all gonna get itWhoa 20 24 hours to goHey kids boys and girlsNow we’ve really done it it’s the end of the worldCuz hey kids we were warnedTonight we’re going out going out like the dinosaurHoping heaven gonna let you inBut ya god is wondering where ya beenWhen idiocracy is all there isNow we know that we’re all gonna get itCarl Sagan rollin in his graveWe all lie to ourselves saying it’s just a phaseYa.

Loudwire;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Explains Decision to Keep Dolly Parton as Nominee;They also offer more insight on what they view as fitting for the Rock Hall.;"Earlier this week, Dolly Parton revealed in statement that she wanted to decline a potential induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, saying that she didn't feel worthy and feared splitting votes for artists who she felt deserved to be in ahead of her. Despite her public statement, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has revealed they intend to keep the country legend in the running for a potential induction, also noting that voting was already underway by the voting panel members.In her initial statement, Parton offered that she was ""flattered and grateful"" for the nomination, but explained, ""I don't feel that I have earned that right. I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out. I do hope that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame will understand and be willing to consider me again - if I'm ever worthy.""Parton's request drew praise from others in the industry, including Judas Priest's Richie Faulkner who called it a ""classy"" move.  ""I think she recognizes her brand, and it didn't necessarily fit into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"" stated Faulkner, adding, ""And I think it raises questions to what the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's brand is as well.""In response, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame issued their own statement revealing that they intended to keep Parton on the voting ballot despite her request to decline the nomination. In their post, they also addressed the oft-questioned definition of what fits ""rock and roll"" where their induction criteria are concerned.Their statement reads as follows:All of us in the music community have seen Dolly Parton's thoughtful note expressing her feeling that she has not earned the right to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to her incredible talent as an artist, her humility is another reason Dolly is a beloved icon by millions of fans around the world.From its inception, Rock & Roll has had deep roots in Rhythm & Blues and Country music. It is not defined by any one genre, rather a sound that moves youth culture. Dolly Parton's music impacted a generation of young fans and influenced countless artists that followed. Her nomination to be considered for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame followed the same process as all other artists who have been considered.Dolly's nomination, along with the other 16 for the class of 2022, was sent out earlier this month to our 1,200 general ballot voters, the majority of whom are artists themselves, for consideration for induction at our ceremony.We are in awe of Dolly's brilliant talent and pioneering spirit and are proud to have nominated her for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. - The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.Parton's request to be removed from consideration is not the first time this has happened with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Sex Pistols famously posted an open letter upon hearing of their nomination, stating, “Next to the Sex Pistols, rock ‘n’ roll and that Hall of Fame is a piss stain. Your museum. Urine in wine. We’re not coming. We’re not your monkey and so what?"" The band was still inducted that year though nobody showed. Other artists have also declined to show for their induction for assorted reasons over the years as well.While the voting body nominations are kept private, there is a ""fan vote"" ballot where fans can vote for their favorite nominees. The Top 5 picks are then submitted as a sole ballot amongst the final tally. At present, Parton ranks fourth in fan voting with over 292,000 votes.31 Hard Rock + Metal Acts Who Deserve to Be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame";2022-03-17;https://loudwire.com/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-explains-decision-to-keep-dolly-parton-as-nominee/;2022-03-19;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREROCKANDROLLHALLOFFAMEEXPLAINSDECISIONTOKEEPDOLLYPARTONASNOMINEE
Loudwire;Sabaton Debut Stunning Music Video for 'Soldier of Heaven';The song depicts the snow-filled 'White War' during WWI.;"The mighty Sabaton are storming into 2022 with a stunning music video for ""Soldier of Heaven,"" the second single off the forthcoming The War to End All Wars album and first new track of the year.""We already released the 'Christmas Truce' and here comes another song which shows the diversity of the new album,"" said bassist Pär Sundström ""In the early listening sessions of the new album, this one was noted among most people as a top song, and we know that this will be a powerful sing-a-long anthem at future concerts.

Loudwire;Fever 333 Singer Confirms Group Will Continue After Band Member Departures;See what he told a fan.;"UPDATE: Fever 333 singer Jason Aalon Butler has now added an official statement concerning the band's future via Instagram. It reads as follows: ""I want to thank Aric and Stephen for their time in this project- not just because a statement feels required, but because I mean that. We shared some incredible experiences over the last few years and for that I will always be grateful."" ""To the supporters of Fever 333- I started this project in order to fill a space in music and culture that I have always wanted to see and know many others like and unlike me would also like to experience. Offering representation and progress not only on stages but through the art is paramount for me. I told myself I would not compromise that vision and I must hold true to that promise. Not only for me, but the others out there looking for somewhere to feel free. So I want to take this moment to say thank you to Aric, Stephen and everyone who has made that possible thus far. The initial era of Fever 333 was incredible in so many ways and I am so excited to present to you the next one."" ""All LOV333. See y'all soon... -Jason Aalon Butler""The news that two thirds of Fever 333 were exiting the band certainly sent shockwaves through the rock world yesterday (Oct. 3), but while commenting on a newly posted Instagram post, Fever 333's Jason Aalon Butler confirmed to a fan that the band will continue.News of the lineup changes were delivered simultaneously by Stephen Harrison and Aric Improta, with Harrison commenting, ""I won’t get into the details but things were pretty bad internally,"" and later adding, ""That plus creative differences sort of left me with no choice."" Improta commented, ""I’d just rather dedicate my time to projects that operate different than that one."" The two musicians also kept open the possibility of working together again.Their exits left Butler as the lone member of Fever 333, and while an official statement did not come from the frontman, he did respond to a fan asking about their future on an Instagram post.The post itself had Butler reflecting on some of the high energy ""shenanigans"" at past Fever 333 shows and asking fans to share their stories. It came with a video of him bounding around the tops of porta-potties at a Self Help Festival performance.With the news making the rounds about the two band member exits, the thread quickly turned away from people sharing their stories to more discussion about the split. At one point, one fan commented, ""I imagine the comments section will be flooded with similar, but… Is Fever 333 continuing without Aric & Steve? My 333 tattoo is for life either way.""Butler responded, ""All good, brotha. It will be. This project was started due to a vision and that vision will be realized because it has to.""fever 333, jason aalon butlerInstagram: mrjasonaalonloading...While no other details were shared about the band's future, it does appear that Butler will continue the group with his central vision still being the driving force.

Loudwire;18 Years Ago: Lamb of God Release 'Ashes of the Wake';On Aug. 31, 2004, Lamb of God broke through with their third album.;"On their fourth album, Ashes of the Wake, which came out Aug. 31, 2004, Lamb of God made the leap from heroes of the underground to contenders for the new American metal throne.Produced by Machine (Pitchshifter, Every Time I Die, King Crimson), who pushed Lamb of God to reach a new level of commercial viability without sacrificing their heaviness or artistic credibility, Ashes of the Wake is both bludgeoning and musically challenging.At the same time, the disc blends a variety of minor-key licks reminiscent of Slayer with staccato riffs that have more in common with Pantera, ensuring that the songs remain memorable, even when crafted within a framework of melody-free vocals, complex, double-bass beats largely informed by Meshuggah and rhythms that shift just as they start grooving.Lamb of God, ""Laid to Rest""Songs like “Laid to Rest,” “Now You’ve Got Something to Die For” and the instrumental title track (which features guest guitar leads by Testament guitarist Alex Skolnick and ex-Megadeth axeman Chris Poland) are simultaneously angular and crushing, setting the stage for songs about the brutality of war, the danger of oppression and the consequences of not challenging authority.For Lamb of God, Ashes of the Wake provided an opportunity to showcase their thrash and melodic death metal influences and break out of the metalcore category critics tried to push the band into. ""I think it's important for us to create a legacy for this band, and I don't want that legacy to be in association with anyone else,"" drummer Chris Adler told me in 2004. ""In our minds, we're a cut above the rest of the bands that are out there right now, and we feel like we put a whole lot more into our music than some of the bands we have been compared to.""Political commentary was nothing new for vocalist Randy Blythe, who grew up enamored with the ferocity and rhetoric of hardcore. But while he had addressed capitalism, greed and war on the band’s first three albums, Ashes of the Wake was more focused and coherent, taking direct aim at the U.S. administration and its policies during the war in Iraq.“Ashes of the Wake” includes harrowing quotes by former Marine Staff Sergeant Jim Massey after he returned from battle and “Omerta” opens with an insightful spoken word passage by Blythe about honor in battle: “…a wounded man shall say to his assailant, ‘If I die, you are forgiven. If I live, I will kill you.’ Such is the rule of honor.”Lamb of God, ""Omerta""“I always like to write about whatever’s I’m thinking about and, at the time, I think the war was on pretty much everyone’s mind,” Blythe said. “Politicians were saying one thing, but it didn’t take a lot to see that what was really going on was something else entirely. And at the same time, all these soldiers were being led into a situation they didn’t sign up for.”Thanks to the skillful twin guitar attack of Mark Morton and Willie Adler and the multifaceted barrages of drummer Chris Adler, Ashes of the Wake demonstrated that Lamb of God were as talented as they were heavy.Still, tracking precise passages without having them sound antiseptic was no easy task. “We definitely pushed ourselves to the limit making the record,” said Morton. “But you know what, I’m glad working with Machine wasn't stress free. I want the guy I'm working with to care and disagree with me and fight for what he thinks is right. If you've got someone that just goes along with you, that means he doesn't give a shit. There should be conflict and resolution.""Lamb of God, ""Now You've Got Something to Die For""Lamb of God wrote and recorded Ashes of the Wake during a few short months in 2004 after returning from touring for their 2003 album As the Palaces Burn. Their new label Epic wanted an album right away, leaving the group little time to analyze what it was doing.“We had to respond quickly, there was no other way,” Morton said. “We were under a lot of pressure because of the time factor. We had just gotten off a record we hadn’t really finish touring for, and before we knew it we were back in the studio writing songs again. And we managed to make a great record that stands up for itself.”The band recorded drums at Water Music Studios in Hoboken, New Jersey, then tracked guitars and vocals at Sound of Music in Richmond. Though the scathing lyrics and unforgiving blend of jagged thrash and fiery Swedish death metal styles were more extreme than most anything released on a major label, Ashes of the Wake deservedly struck a nerve with fans, debuting at number 27 on the Billboard album chart. By August, 2010 the record had sold 398,000 copies and remains the band’s top seller, shifting over 400,000 units in 11 years.“As hard as we worked on the record, I feel like it all paid off,” Morton said. “It just seems like with everything we do we keep getting better. We’re working together better, we’re playing better, the songs are better and as long as we’ve got that momentum going it’s fun to be a part of something like that.”Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;Andy Biersack’s New Year’s Resolution Is One We Can All Learn From;A message to the haters: 'I'm giving less of a f*ck.';"Black Veil Brides singer Andy Biersack tweeted his New Year's resolution yesterday (Dec. 8,) and it's a message that everyone can incorporate into their lives. Biersack says he's going to care less about what people are gossiping about him and focus on the things that bring him joy.In a 3-part post on Thursday, Biersack talked about his need to step away from the ""online drama."" While not addressing any specific ""drama,"" he seems to be referencing the generally ugly things that sometimes get said about himself or Black Veil Brides on social media. And he says while he's had an intense reaction to ""shit talking"" ever since his childhood being bullied as a ""weird (theater) kid,"" he's letting it go.The frontman takes care to note that he is thankful for his life as a musician and performer, and that he doesn't take it for granted. Biersack also writes that being on the tri-headlining ""Trinity of Terror"" tour with Motionless in White and Ice Nine Kills has been an incredible experience.This introspection around a New Year seems to be unusual for Biersack, who took time last year to tell ABC Audio that resolutions are ""ridiculous thing(s) to put on yourself."" He said that his New Year's resolution for 2021 would be the same that it's always been, “To never, at any point in 2022, jump out of a moving plane without a parachute.”Obviously, he kept his 2021 resolution, which is why we've got different one for 2022. An abbreviated transcript of Biersack's heartfelt resolution is below, along with his full tweet.""Since I was a little kid I have always had a tendency to get riled up about what I perceive to be mean or nasty things said about me or anyone I care about and I've done a lot of work to try to curb the urge to snap back or lose my cool for some sense of justice... but sometimes like anyone I just want to say something. We all know whether it's people talking shit about you or drama online (that) there's always something... trying to bait all of us to freak out or argue or engage.If I'm honest I let that shit get to me to a certain degree all the time... but I'm at a place where the idea of trying to battle anyone over nonsense is such a waste of time. I'll always stand up for what I believe is right but beyond that I just want to have a peaceful life and celebrate the really cool shit that you guys have given us the opportunity and platform to do.I guess what I'm saying is that my New Year's resolution is to give less of a fuck about inconsequential shit and clapping back or perpetuating feuds or whatever and maximize the time spent withthe things that bring joy and creativity."" - Andy Biersack25 Holiday Gifts for the Rock + Metal Fan in Your Life";2022-12-09;https://loudwire.com/andy-biersack-new-years-resolution-2022/;2022-12-11;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREANDYBIERSACK’SNEWYEAR’SRESOLUTIONISONEWECANALLLEARNFROM
Loudwire;Maynard James Keenan Tells Joe Rogan What He Really Thinks About TikTok;Keenan also says artists trying to stay relevant reeks of desperation.;"Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan was interviewed on Joe Rogan's podcast and talked about how he thinks users of TikTok view him as an artist. It's a pretty dim view. Maynard says, ""I'm not necessarily relevant.""On the Joe Rogan Experience from Oct. 25, 2022, Keenan and Rogan were talking about staying relevant as a musician over time, and Keenan says that he doesn't have faith that fans of TikTok will appreciate him. ""I won't be relevant to the TikTok-ers of the world... It's not on their radar. The (things) that they listen to now... and respond to now... I'm not necessarily relevant.""Rogan then asks Keenan if he's personally concerned with being relevant. Keenan response contains a snarky dig at some of his contemporaries (who go unnamed.) ""You can't (think about whether or not you are relevant. Because you'll start being desperate and getting plastic surgery and lookin' like a fuckin' alien and trying to insert yourself into some stupid fuckin' thing."" Keenan, then smiling, added, ""I'm not talking anybody. I'm not talking about my peers.""Keenan continues, ""The quest for relevancy turns to desperation very quickly. It reeks. So just maintain your art dude... (Tool) is just having fun creating.""Rogan then says the Keenan has done a lot of ""diverse"" work, referring to his many projects besides Tool, like Puscifer and A Perfect Circle. Keenan says that is due to his musical ""relationships"" with his various bandmates. ""That's the listening part. What does Billy (Howerdel) do, what do Adam (Jones) Justin (Chancellor) and Danny (Carey) do? What does Matt (McJunkins) and Carina (Round) do? I'm listening to what they're doing and having that (musical) conversation with them and building on those relationships. They are different conversations with different people with different life experiences. The art and the sounds that come out of those people is going to be 100 percent different.

Loudwire;Five Finger Death Punch Double Down With Two Futuristic New Videos;See the overarching narrative for the 'Times Like These' and 'Welcome to the Circus' videos.;"Five Finger Death Punch are a band that still values the artistic expression of the music video, and today they've returned with not one, but two new videos, that are part of an overarching storyline. The clips are for the current single ""Times Like These"" as well as ""Welcome to the Circus.""To help set the mood, FFDP start off the ""Times Like These"" video with a series of news reports that start in 2023 with the headline, ""Privacy? What? What Are You Hiding?"" and continue to evolve over the years to discuss issues such as digital safety, the implementation of a national curfew, a change in the national currency, hacker groups, artificial intelligence, the replacing of the Supreme Court and human cloning before settling in the year 2060 in the city of Megapolis One.It's there that a black hooded Ivan Moody looks out over the hologram city landscape with drones circling the city and messages emblazoned on big screens that read ""See Something, Say Something."" Deciding to leave his domicile, Moody hits the dangerous city streets where denizens are being rounded up for being out past curfew. Escaping detection, he eventually risks everything, meeting with Zoltan Bathory in a park who hands him a mysterious instrument while both men are surveilled. The singer flees from two men tailing him, tests out the instrument and mysteriously vanishes as the initial video comes to an end.The action picks up in the ""Welcome to the Circus"" video, as Moody has escaped into a club with the two pursuers hot on his tail. But once again, this special instrument comes in handy as Moody enraptures the crowd by playing it, seemingly stuns his pursuer and signals the other FFDP members. Where does it go from there? More action is teased to follow in whatever their next video may be.The two videos are supposedly tied to the band's upcoming AfterLife graphic novel that will follow the recently released album of the same name. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory, who has handled many of the band's visual representations, is responsible for the story and screenplay, and he co-directed the videos with Dale Restigini.Both songs are featured on the band's recently released AfterLife album, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and helped the band set a Billboard record by becoming their seventh chart-topper on the Billboard Hard Rock Chart.Check out the two new videos below, pick up the AfterLife album here.

Loudwire;Alice Cooper Calls Jeff Beck Greatest Guitarist of All Time, Recalls Opening for Yardbirds When He Was 16;He's been calling him the greatest for years.;"Alice Cooper is one of the many musicians in the rock 'n' roll world who've posted on social media to pay their respects to legendary guitarist Jeff Beck, who died on Tuesday (Jan. 10) at 78. In his post, Cooper called the late rocker the greatest guitarist of all time, and recalled opening for The Yardbirds when he was just 16.One of the earliest renditions of Cooper's band, when he was still in high school and known as Vincent Furnier, was called The Spiders. In Cooper's tweet, he said that The Spiders opened for The Yardbirds, which Beck was a member of from 1965 to '66, after the departure of Eric Clapton.""When I was 16 years old, The Spiders, who became the original Alice Cooper band, opened for the Yardbirds. That night I experienced the greatest guitar player I had ever heard. Half a century later Jeff Beck is still the greatest guitarist, PERIOD,"" Cooper wrote. ""The greatest of all time. He was a friend, and there will NEVER be another Jeff Beck. Ever.""This isn't the first time Cooper has regarded Beck as the world's best guitarist. During a video interview from a few years ago, Cooper confirmed that 1966 was the year The Spiders opened for The Yardbirds, and explained how the performance came to be.""We played a local place called the VIP Club. Every band played The Beatles, or some played The Rolling Stones, we were The Yardbirds band. We played all Yardbirds songs,"" the shock rocker remembered. ""Being the house band, big bands would come in from England. So, we're going to open for The Yardbirds — the real Yardbirds with Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, both in the band.""""Everybody says, 'Who's the best guitar player?' This is what cinched it for me,"" he continued, describing his memory of Beck holding the guitar in front of him and playing triplets as he slowly dropped it by its neck in his hand. ""He catches it right on the last note where it's feeding back, and we went, 'What? That's impossible!' That was 1966, so how good is Jeff Beck now... He's probably, technically, the best player.""Watch the interview clip below.Alice Cooper Calls Jeff Beck the Greatest Guitarist of All TimeTop 66 Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All TimeCounting down rock and metal's greatest guitar players.";2023-01-12;https://loudwire.com/alice-cooper-jeff-beck-greatest-guitarist-recalls-opening-yardbirds/;2023-01-14;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREALICECOOPERCALLSJEFFBECKGREATESTGUITARISTOFALLTIME,RECALLSOPENINGFORYARDBIRDSWHENHEWAS16
Loudwire;Ghostface Returns in the ‘Scream VI’ Trailer;Maybe let that call go to voicemail...;Guys, if you ever find yourself in a horror movie and the phone starts to ring ... maybe just let it go to voicemail.Sadly, the folks in the Scream saga never seem to do that. They answer. They get tormented by Ghostface. And, invariably, they die. A new Ghostface is back in the trailer for the new Scream VI, and he’s got another batch of victims to stalk. They include returning series veterans such as Courteney Cox and Hayden Panettiere, and newcomers like Samara Weaving and Tony Revolori.This latest film is also the first to be set outside Scream’s usual home of suburban California. This time, Ghostface takes a bite out of the Big Apple. (We don’t have enough problems around here? Now we gotta deal with Ghostfaces?!?)Watch the new Scream VI trailer below:This looks like another solid legacyquel after the previous Scream (not to be confused with the original Scream, which was also called Scream), although it is a little weird to watch the trailer for a Scream movie that doesn’t include Neve Campbell, who chose not to return for this film. Based on Cox’s appearance in the trailer, she may not last too much longer in the franchise either.Here is Scream VI’s official synopsis:Following the latest Ghostface killings, the four survivors leave Woodsboro behind and start a fresh chapter. In Scream VI, Melissa Barrera (“Sam Carpenter”), Jasmin Savoy Brown (“Mindy Meeks-Martin”), Mason Gooding (“Chad Meeks-Martin”), Jenna Ortega (“Tara Carpenter”), Hayden Panettiere (“Kirby Reed”) and Courteney Cox (“Gale Weathers”) return to their roles in the franchise alongside Jack Champion, Henry Czerny, Liana Liberato, Dermot Mulroney, Devyn Nekoda, Tony Revolori, Josh Segarra, and Samara Weaving.Scream VI is scheduled to open in theaters on March 10.10 Horror Movies That Are Supposedly CursedFrom mysterious on-set accidents to unexplainable audience reactions, these movies have all gained a reputation for being cursed.Get our free mobile app;2023-01-19;https://loudwire.com/ghostface-scream-vi-trailer/;2023-01-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREGHOSTFACERETURNSINTHE‘SCREAMVI’TRAILER

Loudwire;Chris Jericho Explains Why Fozzy Will Never Be a Political Band;That isn't their niche.;"Some bands choose to use their platforms to spread certain political and social messages, whereas others prefer to just make feel-good rock 'n' roll. Chris Jericho declared that Fozzy will never be the former, and explained why in an interview with Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez.""You have the wrong band if you're looking for those subject matters in our music. We do not ever, nor have we ever, been a political band,"" Jericho stated. ""Fozzy's never been that type of platform... I mentioned Rush earlier, Iron Maiden, Metallica, AC/DC — if I ever heard AC/DC talking about COVID, I would fucking be so sad. You don't really want that in your rock 'n' roll.""Despite Jericho's resistance to covering political subjects in Fozzy songs, he did say that the ""tone of the last few years"" made its way into their upcoming new album Boombox — especially in songs such as ""Sane"" and ""I Still Burn."" However, most of the lyrics deal with believing in oneself, betrayal and apocalyptic situations.The frontman recalled an interview that Fozzy once did with Kerrang!, where the publication lumped them in with Halestorm, Black Stone Cherry and The Struts as a new generation of ""feel-good"" rock bands.""If you're talking about rock 'n' roll with more of a fun vibe to it, and I mentioned those other bands that Fozzy is in with, then that is by design because that's what we want to do,"" he elaborated.""There's a lot of issues in the world prior to COVID, during COVID, after COVID... I think when people come to a rock 'n' roll show, you don't really want that kind of pushed in your face. At least you don't want that at a Fozzy gig. I think what we do is provide a little bit of a diversion and an outlet to blow off some steam if those things or other things are bothering you in your life. I think that's a huge responsibility and I take it very seriously.""To hear more about Fozzy's forthcoming record Boombox, Jericho's weight loss journey and more, tune into Loudwire Nights tonight at 7PM ET.

Loudwire;Rage Against the Machine Cancel 2023 North American Tour, Zack de la Rocha Issues Statement;See what the singer had to say.;"Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha has some disappointing news to deliver, revealing that the recovery from his torn achilles tendon injury will need more time and that as a result the band has decided to call off their 2023 North American tour dates.Fans will recall de la Rocha injuring his leg very early on in the band's touring this past summer. Determined to continue the run, the singer performed nightly sitting on a road touring case, unable to maneuver around the stage on his own.Shortly after the North American dates concluded, the band called off their U.K. and European tour leg, acting upon ""medical guidance.""Now Zack himself has issued a public statement sharing his disappointment over next year's North American tour cancellation and further explaining the significance of his his injuryIt's been almost three months since Chicago and I still look down at my leg in disbelief. Two years of waiting through the pandemic hoping we would have an opening to be a band again and continue the work we started 30 some odd years ago. Rehearsing, training, reconciling, working our way back to form. Then one-and-a-half shows into it and my tendon tears. Felt like a sick joke the universe played on me. As I write this I remind myself it's just bad circumstance. Just a fucked up moment.Unfortunately it is a moment that requires a lot of work and healing. I have a severe tear in my left achilles tendon and only 8 percent of my tendon was left intact. And even that was severely compromised. It's not simply a question of being able to perform again, but extends to basic functionality going forward. That's why I've made the painful and difficult decision to cancel the remaining shows on our 2023 North American leg.I hate cancelling shows. I hate disappointing our fans. You have all waited so patiently to see us and that is never lost on me. I never take that for granted. For you I have the ultimate gratitude and respect.To my brothers Tim, Brad, and Tom; to El P, Killer Mike, Trackstar and the whole RTJ crew; to everyone on our production team: techs, cooks, drivers, assistants, security squad, to anyone and everyone who made the shows thus far possible, all my love and respect. I hope to see you very soon.- Zack de la Rocha.It was noted that tickets bought online through Ticketmaster or AXS will be automatically refunded to the original method of payment used once funds are received from the venue (which is usually completed within 30 days).

Loudwire;10 Things We Love About Metallica's New Album, '72 Seasons';Though we could probably name 72 more, these are 10 things we love about Metallica's new album, '72 Seasons.';"On the morning of Monday, Nov. 28, Metallica stopped the rock world in its tracks when they announced plans for their next studio album, 72 Seasons. Along with that announcement came the first taste of what to expect with the pummeling ""Lux Æterna.""Since then, Metallica have released three more songs: ""Screaming Suicide,"" ""If Darkness Had a Son"" and most recently, the title track, ""72 Seasons.""GET METALLICA TICKETSEach song brought a different flavor of what Metallica have been working on over the last several years, but they all also pointed toward a common thread of heavy guitars and drums guiding even heavier lyrics.And the rest of 72 Seasons only affirms that commonality as Metallica showcase why they're the biggest rock band in the world. An album that begs to be listened to at full blast, 72 Seasons might be one of Metallica's heaviest collections of songs they've ever released in their 40 years of being in the studio.Which means, it's not for the faint of heart.But no matter whether you've been a fan since No Life 'Til Leather or you're just coming around to the idea of joining the Metallica Family, we're pretty sure you'll dig these 10 things we love about Metallica's new album, 72 Seasons.The Heavy Opening 1-2-3 Punch of ""72 Seasons,"" ""Shadows Follow"" and ""Screaming Suicide""The title track is one of the standout moments on the album, and with 72 Seasons, we get it up front before anything else. As the song culminates and wraps up with James Hetfield singing, ""Feeding on the wrath of man,"" he leaves you with no chance to catch your breath; ""Shadows Follow,"" one of the heaviest songs on 72 Seasons, comes in at full force.Hetfield opens with the dark lyrics, ""Hanging by a thread as I play dead,"" which sets the stage for the rest of the song as he tries to outrun his shadows, leading into the reflective—and if possible on this album, hopeful—""Screaming Suicide."" Each of these songs can easily stand on their own, but when they come together, they create an absolutely unforgettable opening sequence of heavy metal.James Hetfield's Vocals on ""Too Far Gone?""When the world hears 72 Seasons, no matter what the critics say or what the reviews try to pontificate, there will be one universal truth that everyone will agree on: James Hetfield sounds really, really good on his record.There is an anger and intensity that hasn't been present on recent albums — an anger and intensity that fans will recognize from '90s-era-live Hetfield that started returning throughout 2022. While this energy is on every single track, ""Too Far Gone?"" is the song that captures Hetfield's newfound ferocity at its best.Kirk Hammett + Rob Trujillo Have Seven Writing CreditsWhen Metallica released St. Anger, there were no individual writing credits. Instead, the liner notes simply said all of the songs were ""written by Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett/Rock [producer Bob Rock].""Then on Death Magnetic, the first studio album to feature Robert Trujillo on bass, the liner notes specified that Hetfield wrote all the lyrics while the entire band was credited with the music compositions.With Hardwired...to Self-Destruct, writing credits started looking more like they did in the '80s, with Hetfield and Lars Ulrich credited as the sole writers (save for ""ManUNkind,"" which Trujillo contributed to).So when the credits were revealed for 72 Seasons, it was surprising to see Kirk Hammett and Trujillo were given writing credits on more than half of the album's tracks. Hetfield and Ulrich co-wrote all of the songs and Hammett contributed to ""72 Seasons, ""Crown of Barbed Wire,"" ""Chasing Light"" and ""If Darkness Had a Son,"" while Trujillo's efforts are heard on ""Screaming Suicide,"" ""Sleepwalk My Life Away"" and ""You Must Burn!"" Interestingly, Trujillo and Hammett never co-wrote together.Kirk's Solo on ""You Must Burn!""""You Must Burn!"" is one of three tracks that clocks in longer than 7 minutes, and though it won't ever be confused as one of Metallica's fastest or thrashiest songs of their career, it builds toward a memorable solo from The Ripper himself. The solo runs around a minute and stands out as one of his best on 72 Seasons.Get our free mobile appHetfield's Lyrics Are More Confessional—and Vulnerable—Than Ever BeforeOver the last couple of decades, James Hetfield has been anything but shy. He's been open about his continued struggle with alcohol and addiction and he was more vulnerable than ever before throughout the filming of Some Kind of Monster.It's not uncommon for Hetfield to insert his life and history into the lyrics he writes, but on 72 Seasons, his willingness to put himself out there is on a completely different level.In the first half of the album the chugging ""You Must Burn!"" captures the feelings one may experience as an outcast. ""Smile as it burns to the ground / The perfect don’t want you around,"" Hetfield sings in the chorus. ""Question yourself, you may learn / You are the witch, you must burn.""While the lyrics heard on ""Room of Mirrors"" deal with introspection and doubt in others ability to perceive you for who you really are. Who hasn't dealt with feelings of insecurity over whether or not someone (or even yourself) will understand all the parts of you — good and bad?""In a mirrored roomAll alone I standSeeing past the flesh and boneThe shame and the fear I hideCould I show you what’s inside?Would you criticize, scrutinize, sanitize my pain?Would you summarize, patronize, classify insane?So I stand here before youYou might judge you might just bury meOr you might set me free""In the album's closer ""Inamorata"" Hetfield personifies misery as a lover by illustrating the painful push and pull of a toxic relationship, “Comfort in the hell I know / Resentment like a cancer grows.”Overall, the album repeats themes of struggling through darkness and trying to find your way to the light and, regardless of your specific set of circumstances, who experiencing the human existence can't relate to that?Nearly Every Second of Music Matches the Heaviness of Hetfield's LyricsAs we mentioned at the start of this, 72 Seasons isn't for the faint of heart. If your head isn't spinning by the time the 77 minutes are up, you may want to make sure you actually pressed play.The heaviness of the guitars, drums and bass are relentless, all creating a sonic environment for Hetfield's lyrics to dwell in. While this might be overwhelming to some, it simply deepens the journey that Hetfield is taking listeners on; there are no delicate arrangements here except for a brief moment in ""Inamorata,"" and even then, it doesn't really feel any lighter given the theme of the song. Every second of the music matches the weight of the lyrics.Metallica Fans Get Another Powerful Title TrackThink about the title tracks that Metallica have given fans over the years: ""Ride the Lightning."" ""Master of Puppets."" ""...And Justice For All."" ""St. Anger."" Each one is an epic in its own right that tells the story of the entire album in one song. Even ""Hardwired""—though, we're not sure if you can officially call this a title track — does that with Hardwired...to Self-Destruct.And Metallica have done it again with ""72 Seasons,"" a song we've already showered praise on in this list of things we love about the album. And as good as ""St. Anger"" and ""Hardwired"" might be, ""72 Seasons"" deserves a place among those legendary title tracks from the '80s.There Are Some Fun Easter Eggs Throughout 72 Seasons""Lux Æterna"" made ""Full speed or nothin'"" a common phrase for Metallica fans over the last few months, but that's been a mantra of the band and fanbase for 40 years ever since they sang it on ""Motorbreath"" — ""Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing.""Other fun easter eggs pop up at the end of some of the tracks. After ""Screaming Suicide"" concludes, you can hear one of the band members—is that you, Rob?—say, ""Nice,"" and following ""Inamorata,"" two of the guys say, ""Thank you, good night!"" followed by, ""That was the best one."" We're excited to keep finding hidden surprises as we listen to 72 Seasons over and over.The Sprawling Jam on Closing Track ""Inamorata""When Metallica revealed the track times for the songs on 72 Seasons, metal fans collectively let out a ""gasp"" when they saw the closing track: ""Inamorata,"" coming in at 11 minutes, 10 seconds. An inamorata is someone's female lover, and for Hetfield and company, that female lover in the song is Misery: ""Misery, she needs me / But I need her more / Misery, she loves me / But I love her more.""It's not a happy note to end an album on, but given everything you've read so far, what else did you expect? This back-and-forth between Hetfield and Misery lasts for more than 11 minutes, but it never feels like it's dragging on or that there are wasted moments on the track. Hammett shines a couple of different times; there is a really powerful moment where, about halfway through, Hetfield sings ""Misery"" right along with Hammett's solo. That's followed by the most low-key moment on the entire album as we hear Ulrich ride the high hat while Trujillo keeps the pace going.Everything on the Cover and Inside the Album's PackagingWhen 72 Seasons was first announced, it seemed like the album cover received mixed reviews from fans, but one thing is certain: You won't forget the contrast of the yellow and black color scheme and the charred remains of a baby crib and many other childhood items. If the music and lyrics of 72 Seasons aren't for the faint of heart, then the album cover perfectly matches up with what's inside.Metallica, '72 Seasons'Blackenedloading...72 Seasons is out April 14 and can be purchased here.

Loudwire;Someone Put a Chair From Guns N' Roses' St. Louis Riot on eBay;I'll take it, goddamn it!;"If you were witnessing chaos unfold before your eyes that you knew would later be considered a historical event, what would you do to commemorate it? For an attendee of Guns N' Roses' infamous 1991 concert in St. Louis, it was to take one of the chairs from the venue home — and now they've put it on eBay.Yes, it's true. You can actually buy a piece of what became known as the Riverport Riot that took place at the Riverport Amphitheatre near St. Louis after a very pissed-off Axl Rose dove into the crowd, barked about the ""lame ass security,"" shattered his microphone against the stage and walked out. The crowd inevitably also became very pissed-off, and a riot ensued.The story goes that a fan in the crowd was recording or taking photos of the show, which the frontman noticed during the band's performance of ""Rocket Queen."" He pointed to the individual and demanded security to confiscate the camera, but they apparently didn't move quickly enough, so he leapt into the audience and started fighting with the guy. He was later sued for initiating the riot. ""Fuck You, St. Louis!"" was included in the liner notes of the band's Use Your Illusion albums, and they were prohibited from performing there until 2017.Anyway, the person who listed the chair from the Riverport Amphitheatre didn't actually take it themselves, but a friend they were with did, according to the listing.""I was in the audience at the GN'R concert that ended in the infamous ban of GN'R in St. Louis in '91. A friend grabbed a chair during the mayhem on the way out and put it in my car. I've held on to this piece of history for 31 years. The wife said it's time to find it a new home. I am auctioning the chair as well as the original ticket stub,"" the description reads.Unfortunately — well, if you were really interested in owning the chair — the listing ended, and there weren't even any bids on it. The owner put it up for $100, and offered free local pickup from the St. Louis area or a whopping $257 in expedited shipping. But, you can still check out the original listing, and who knows — maybe they'll put it up again.See a photo of the listing, and videos of both Rose's stage dive and the riot that followed below.Guns N' Roses St. Louis Riot ChaireBay.comloading...Axl Rose Dives Offstage During 'Rocket Queen' St. Louis 1991St. Louis Riverport Riot 19918 of the Nicest Things Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose Has Ever DoneMr. Nice Guy.";2022-10-06;https://loudwire.com/chair-guns-n-roses-st-louis-riot-ebay/;2022-10-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRESOMEONEPUTACHAIRFROMGUNSN'ROSES'ST.LOUISRIOTONEBAY
Loudwire;Steven Tyler Not Well Enough to Perform Las Vegas Show, Aerosmith Issue Statement;Best wishes for a speedy recovery!;This past Friday (Dec. 2), Aerosmith were forced to cancel their show at the Dolby Live theater at Park MGM in Las Vegas due to an undisclosed illness suffered by 74-year-old frontman Steven Tyler.The performance would’ve been a part of the band’s ongoing 2022 “Deuces Are Wild” residency (which began on June 17). As reported by Blabbermouth, Aerosmith issued a statement (via Twitter) “about two hours before showtime” (around 9:45PM ET) that read:It is with great disappointment that we are forced to cancel tonight's show in Las Vegas due to Steven feeling unwell and unable to perform. He is expected to make a full recovery for Monday night's Las Vegas show. We sincerely apologize for the last minute notice. Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster.com will be automatically refunded. All other refunds will be available at point of purchase.Although Aerosmith received plenty of positive and encouraging responses to the announcement, many ticketholders were understandably upset. For instance, one Twitter user replied: “Thanks! Months of planning and lots of money spent to fly here to come see you, and then you cancel at the last minute after sound check? So pissed off!”Unfortunately, this wasn’t the first time the group had to call off shows this year, either, as they previously terminated their “Deuces Are Wild” June and July commitments due to Tyler “enter[ing] a rehabilitation facility following a relapse.”Even so, Tyler was in top form when he joined Eminem onstage to sing the latter’s “Sing for the Moment” – which samples Aerosmith’s seminal “Dream On” – at the 37th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022.Whether or not Aerosmith will resume their residency tomorrow night (Dec. 5) – and continue with planned shows on Dec. 8 and Dec. 11 – remains to be seen. That said, you can purchase tickets here.Of course, Loudwire wishes Tyler a speedy recovery.Also, you can see the band’s official Twitter post – and some mixed reactions from fans – below:Steven Tyler + Eminem Perform Together at Rock Hall Induction Ceremony 2022;2022-12-05;https://loudwire.com/steven-tyler-not-well-las-vegas-show-aerosmith-issue-statement/;2022-12-07;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRESTEVENTYLERNOTWELLENOUGHTOPERFORMLASVEGASSHOW,AEROSMITHISSUESTATEMENT
Loudwire;Tommy Lee Shares New Artistic Version of Viral Nude Photo, Fans Split on Naked Shenanigans;'HELP,' says his wife Brittany Furlan.;"Tommy Lee came back with another full frontal nude photo post Friday (Aug. 12), this time circumventing Instagram rules by making the previous X-rated picture look like a painting.The Motley Crue drummer broke the internet day before with an early morning overshare of a fully nude, penis-exposed pic that was posted to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The picture was removed from Facebook and Instagram as it violates the platform's restrictions on pornography. Twitter has no such restrictions.Lee feigned a mistake in posting, captioning the nude, ""Ooooopppsss.""Now, a deliberate, reworked edit of the D-pic popped up on Lee's Instagram late Thursday night. UPDATE: What we at Loudwire originally believed to be a filter run over the original photo, is actually a painting done by a real live human being, an artist named Ziva Barrett. She created a brightly colored mosaic of shapes and designs inspired by Lee's tattoos and... stuff, over the outline of his body. Barrett, on her Facebook page, said ""When Tommy Lee ""hands"" you a dick pic, you don't ask questions, you grab a (big) canvas instead and get to work."" Lee got a hold of it and shared it to his page.Some Tommy fans are also ""allowing"" it, while others seem to be digitally rolling their eyeballs.On the pro-side, the most popular fan comments are ""The return of the king,"" ""Damn right tommy,"" ""PURE ART,"" and ""😂😂😂😂bro said I'll find a way.""Fans that look like they've had enough are saying ""Tommy put the phone down,"" ""NURSE HE'S OFF HIS MEDS AGAIN,"" ""Not again Tommy,"" and ""Come on bruh."" Even Tommy's wife, Brittany Furlan, writes simply, ""HELP.""Crue fans were not the only ones to take notice of the original nude photo. CNN reports that it ignited an argument of a ""double standard"" within social media. ""'So Tommy Lee can post a picture of his penis on @instagram that's still up three hours later but a picture of my curvy booty in a thong bikini gets taken down? Cool, cool,' journalist Lola Méndez tweeted. She compared seeing Lee's nude picture on social media to getting an unsolicited picture of a penis. And a user posted: '2022 and we have to witness Tommy Lee being praised for posting a frontal nude while Britney Spears is constantly momshamed for posting sexy pics.'""Check out the transformation here, if you dare. It hasn't been re-sculpted or anything, so parts are gonna still look like parts.As Lee advances his work in the visual medium, his main hustle with Motley Crue continues.

Loudwire;Is Blink-182 News Coming Soon? Band Clears Instagram & Website;Random posters and billboards have started appearing too.;"What are Blink-182 trying to tell us? That seems to be the question of the day for fans reading into recent mysterious activity from the band.Out of nowhere, Blink has completely wiped their online presence, clearing out all of their Instagram posts on the official band account. Visiting the band's website, there is a scrolling ""under construction"" message, and the site also notes they are ""hard at work"" at to ""check back soon,"" further signaling some news may be coming soon.Adding to the Easter eggs, over on Twitter, NME noticed the band has also randomly started ""liking"" a bunch of posts from the 2013 era that hint at the band 10 years in the future - i.e., in 2023.""Its going to be really strange in 10 years when blink182 is classic rock and we hear it in drug stores and elevators,"" says one post that the band account liked, while another reads, ""Blink-182 is writing a new album! It should be released in the next 10 years or so!""Another piece of fodder is the fact that all of their social profiles have now been updated with their old-school black-and-white smiley face logo. One more piece of possible evidence posted by a fan on the Blink-182 Reddit is a series of billboards advertising something called ""182 Industries."" The posters say, ""Your future is cumming...in the blink of an eye"" and also include a website for onehundredeightytwo.com. When you type it into a browser, it redirects to the official Blink-182 website.In Peru, another astute fan noticed billboards with a new logo and posted the finding on Twitter.The recent developments come after months of speculation that the three original members - Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker - are planning a full reunion. DeLonge has been estranged from the band since 2015. But, In August, the former guitarist-vocalist shared a retro image of the band together in the old days on Instagram and added the band's account to his profile bio.Around the same time, when the band's current guitarist Matt Skiba was asked about his status in the troupe on Instagram, he shared, ""Your guess is as good as mine.""Though, at that time, Loudwire reported that Hoppus shared on Discord that there was ""no news to share"" about a possible reunion, it was also said that the relationship between DeLonge and his former bandmates had been improving with DeLonge communicating with Hoppus during his recent cancer battle.Hoppus also did note in the Discord chat that when the time came for any announcement, it would be made on official accounts, stating, ""If and when blink has any announcement about anything, you will hear it from the official blink-182 outlets."" So, could this be the time?

Loudwire;Frank Bello Proud to See His Memoir Helping Others Deal With Abandonment + Loss;The Anthrax bassist speaks about his book, an upcoming solo album and more.;"Anthrax bassist Frank Bello was the latest guest on Full Metal Jackie's weekend radio program. While the band has been working on new material over the last couple years, Bello was busy with additional items, including his recently released memoir, Fathers, Brothers and Sons: Surviving Anguish, Abandonment and Anthrax.The book was an emotional one which opened up past wounds that Bello admitted he wasn't properly prepared to address, namely his abandonment issues that stemmed from an absent father as well as the struggle his family had to endure as a result. Still, recollecting these difficult moments of life proved to be cathartic and Bello has also seen the positive impact it has had on readers who have had to face similar obstacles in their own lives.The bassist also touched on his debut solo album, which is still a work in progress, and spoke about what it felt like to finally get back onstage with Anthrax last year.Your book revisits times and events that were either comforting or traumatic. In what ways did you prepare for the outpouring of emotion that would come with writing this book?When my co-writer Joel McIver and I started writing the book, I didn't prepare myself and I probably should have [in order] to [be able to] open myself up like that. He's great at triggering memories and then they just started pouring out. I didn't realize I went over the edge with it and some of it was pretty traumatic to relive my brother's death and some of the ugly stuff I've gone through in my life — abandonment, all that stuff.Chapter 13 [deals with] my brother Anthony when he was murdered. I literally had to have a box of tissues with me. We took multiple breaks because I was really having a hard time. I felt like I was reliving it.The people that are reading this book are saying that it feels like they're living it with me. It's really cathartic now that it's out and it's not mine anymore. Just like when you do songs and when you write a record, it's no longer yours anymore, it's everybody's.Everybody knows it's your story, but everybody has it and they understand. I'm getting a lot of great letters and emails from people who it's helping with abandonment issues and loss.There's also a lot of great rock 'n' roll stories from Anthrax — all this stuff hanging out with Metallica and Slayer, all this good stuff... So there's a nice balance of both.RarebirdRarebirdloading...As you mentioned, telling your story can be cathartic and revealing, especially to one's self. What did you learn about yourself by sharing your past?That I want to pass the torch and I want to help people. It's weird to say that. It doesn't sound honest, but it really is honest. I have a 15 year-old son and I really want to pass the torch and say, ""This is how dad did it. These are the mistakes I've made. If you can learn from this, if it can help you to get into your life and have a better life. Try not to make these mistakes...""Also dealing with loss and everything I've dealt with is [knowing] how to brush yourself off after you've fallen down and how to move on tomorrow. That's important. A lot of people are getting that out of this book, which is really, really great for me to hear, so I've learned that a lot about myself. It's a good feeling that I'm getting.Throughout the book, you repeatedly state a desire to help people by sharing your story. Why is it so important to you to positively affect other people's lives?Because I know how it feels on the other side. Let's take the abandonment issue — my dad took off when I was like 10 years old. I was the oldest of a family of five. I had two younger brothers and two younger sisters and I remember the hollowness and that hole that he just wasn't there anymore. There was no money. My mom didn't have a job, she was a homemaker. All she did was cook and she didn't know anything to like skill wise [to be a licensed trade worker]. I remember being in that house and there was nothing there and all of a sudden the house got taken away from us because there was no money.I remember no food. I remember seeing that one box of Rice-A-Roni that was left when there was no more money left and seeing my mom's tears as she's trying to make it last for five people — five kids and that one box of Rice-A-Roni.That's a very honest and true story that still strikes me. I never wanted anybody to feel like that in life. I don't care what you do, what or who you are — I don't want anybody to feel that emptiness that I felt. I don't think anybody should ever feel that emptiness. So, I just tell my story and this is why I'm a proponent of great fathers and great mothers and strong women.It's a family book too. It's it's about brushing yourself off and being with your family and making yourself strong again.Evil Robb Photography, LoudwireEvil Robb Photography, Loudwireloading...In addition to the book, you've also been writing music for your first solo album. What's exhilarating and scary about creative projects that come solely from you.You have two sides of your life — the Anthrax side (it's really the specific music you write for that and all takes care of itself) and you have other songs that are really not Anthrax and you put it to the side and you say, ""What do I do with this? This sounds like something from inside me.""I've done that with a collection of these songs and for people who haven't heard this before, David Ellefson and I did a side project a couple years ago called Altitudes and Attitude. This is more like a continuation of that. I wrote a lot of this stuff on that with Dave and this is just me. This is the next step of those songs.People really that dug that and really like that music, so I think they will like this. I don't know when I'm going to put it out. I don't know if it's going to be an EP or a full record, but I have them put away and I'm still writing as we speak.Last year Anthrax was able to play at least a few shows. How did not being able to play for an audience make you more appreciative when you finally could be onstage again?We were lucky enough to do nine shows and they were all festival type shows and they were great. You don't realize what you have until it's gone.I remember the first show back. I was very weird about going onstage, because I didn't know if i was in the right shape [to perform a set]. When you're on tour, you get in a certain kind of shape — your body is not going break down. Although I work out at home, it's not the same as being on tour and doing the repetition. I was really nervous, but after two songs I was fine and I really, really missed it and I still miss it.I can't wait to actually have a tour. On one of these shows, there was a tour bus there. I hadn't seen a tour bus in a couple of years. I facetiously said, ""Wow, what is that?"" It's just such a different way of life of not doing what you do and just seeing shows.It's a long time coming, but I do think, when all this stuff calms down, that people are going to be ready to rage as we all are. Not only as a player, but also as a music fan, I can't wait to go see great shows. I look positively and optimistically toward the future.Thanks to Frank Bello for the interview.

Loudwire;Classic Metal Church Drummer Kirk Arrington Has Died at 61;Rest in peace.;"Former Metal Church drummer Kirk Arrington has died at age 61.News of the musician's passing was shared on social media by Metal Church, who state, ""We just received the sad news, Kirk Arrington passed away this morning due to health issues. RIP in brother! See you on the other side....""Arrington first joined the group in 1981 and made his recording debut on the Four Hymns demo in 1982, which was followed up by another demo release a year later. In 1984, Metal Church released their self-titled debut and Arrington remained behind the kit through 1995, rejoining again from 1998 through 2006. In all, he performed on seven of their studio albums and also played drums on Metal Church founder Kurdt Vanderhoof's pair of solo records.Sadly, the singers on every album Arrington played on (except 2004's The Weight of the World) have also passed on. David Wayne, who appeared in Metal Church, The Dark and Masterpeace died in 2005 and Mike Howe, who sang on Blessing In Disguise, The Human Factor and Hanging in the Balance, died in 2021.The band is currently fronted by Marc Lopes, who makes his debut on the new album, Congregation of Annihilation, which comes out on Friday (May 25).Loudwire extends our condolences to the Arrington family and all of Kirk's bandmates, friends and loved ones.Kirk Arrington DiscographyMetal ChurchMetal Church (1984)The Dark (1986)Blessing In Disguise (1989)The Human Factor (1991)Hanging in the Balance (1993)Masterpeace (1999) *drummer Jeff Wade also contributed to this albumThe Weight of the World (2004)VanderhoofVanderhoof (1997)A Blur In Time (2002)Garden of EdenFeel Me (2007)Metal Church, ""Ton of Bricks"" (Live at Dynamo, 1991)50 Best Metal Album Openers of the 1980s (Ranked)The most undeniable tracks to open '80s metal albums!";2023-05-23;https://loudwire.com/metal-curch-drummer-kirk-arrington-dead-61/;2023-05-24;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRECLASSICMETALCHURCHDRUMMERKIRKARRINGTONHASDIEDAT61
Loudwire;MGK’s Flamethrower Birthday Party Ends With Police Helicopter - Watch;The cops cramped his party.;"Machine Gun Kelly celebrated his 33rd birthday on Saturday (April 22), but the party resulted in a police helicopter issuing a demand for everyone to leave as the multi-genre artist was seen wielding a very active flamethrower.As to why MGK felt it necessary to equip himself with the fire-spewing weapon, that remains unclear. Was he using it to light candles on a birthday cake? Probably not. Perhaps simply because it's badass? That's all pure speculation, but it was his birthday and he was clearly doing what he wanted.Get Machine Gun Kelly TicketsWhat is clear, however, is that the police were not thrilled and issued demands to those in attendance, as captured in a video clip shared on MGK's Instagram.In the video, a police offer says through a loudspeaker, ""Party's over.

Loudwire;Atreyu's Brandon Saller on the Band's Two New EPs + What's Next;Brandon Saller of Atreyu opens up about the band's two new EPs that have already come out this year and what fans can expect in the future.;"On the heels of the release of The Moment You Find Your Flame—Atreyu's second EP released in 2023—singer Brandon Saller joined Loudwire Nights on Tuesday (Aug. 22) to discuss the themes behind the EPs and what's next for the band.""Life constantly moves in cycles where you're maybe at the bottom and searching for something and then it maybe gets better and then everything's great and then it gets bad again,"" Saller told host Chuck Armstrong about the major theme of The Moment You Find Your Flame and its predecessor, The Hope of a Spark.""Life runs in these cycles [and these EPs] allow us to kind of tell that story and evoke that feeling. I feel like each EP has that moment of absolute zero where you don't have an ounce of hope. You have no direction. You don't know what you're supposed to do.""But just as life runs in cycles, Saller and Atreyu don't leave their listeners drowning in that lack of hope. As Saller explained, he believes it's actually in that moment of despair that you're able to move forward.""You kind of start to figure it out and then you have that moment of glory at the top.""Brandon Saller Previews Atreyu's Third EPWith two EPs released in the matter of a few months, Saller assured the Loudwire Nights audience that there is still plenty more new music on the horizon, including another EP to complete the trilogy.""It's three pieces that lead into the big picture album,"" Saller said. ""It will go through the same journey. The next EP is going to be called The Torch In the Dark; you'll notice that the titles [of the EPs] are the beginning, middle and end. The Hope of a Spark is the bottom. The Moment You Find Your Flame is the 'aha' moment and The Torch In the Dark is, 'I found the thing that's guiding me.' And those will lead into an album that's called The Beautiful Dark of Life.""As soon as he mentioned the title of the album, it was clear Saller had a big smile on his face as he followed up, ""The title came from something so pure, if I can just tell a quick story.""Obviously, Chuck gave Saller the floor.""Two years ago, kind of during COVID, we were walking out of a restaurant and I had my three-and-a-half-year-old on my shoulders and we walked under an overhang and she was like, 'Dad, what's that?' And she points to the shadow. And I said, 'Oh, that's a shadow.' And she kind of sighs and goes, 'Shadows are the beautiful dark of life.' I was like, 'What?!' I immediately wrote it down in my phone. I'm a songwriter and you just handed me gold, kid.""READ MORE: Disturbed's David Draiman Names the Pop Star He Respects the MostAs he looked back on that moment, Saller was quick to look ahead, too.With two EPs out, a third on the way and an album on the horizon, he told Chuck that Atreyu are focused on the same thing they've always been focused on: Putting out the best music that they can.""We want to be the best band that we can be. We want to be proud of what we're doing. I think that's the most important thing for us, we want to just always be proud of what we're doing.""What Else Did Atreyu's Brandon Saller Discuss on Loudwire Nights?Why he believes Atreyu have never had any overnight success, but rather, a slow ascendance over the last 25 yearsThe artwork of The Hope of a Spark and The Moment You Find Your Flame, how they're connected and what he hopes listeners take from themWhat it was like playing the rotating second stage at Ozzfest 2004Listen to the Full Interview in the Podcast Player BelowBrandon Saller joined Loudwire Nights on Tuesday, Aug. 22; the show replays online here, and you can tune in live every weeknight at 7PM ET or on the Loudwire app; you can also see if the show is available on your local radio station and listen to interviews on-demand.

Loudwire;32 Years Ago: Black Crowes Release 'Shake Your Money Maker';Revisit the band's breakout game changer.;"It was the turn of the decade and the rock world needed something fresh to break through the glut of highly produced hair metal / hard rock that was flooding the airwaves. Though grunge would eventually be the force to overturn rock radio as we knew it a year later, The Black Crowes eventually became the breakout band in 1990 that started to show there was finally a fresh appetizer on the menu.This strong five-piece rock band emerged as a force with their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker — a record that embraced early era rock's soulful R&B influences while bringing back a Rolling Stones-esque swagger for a new generation.The group started six years earlier with brothers Chris and Rich Robinson forming Mr. Crowe's Garden in 1984 while still teenagers. The group went through a series of other members in the years leading up to settling on a lineup that would eventually playing on Money Maker and the changes didn't stop after the album was recorded. Guitarist Jeff Cease played on the record, but eventually gave way to Marc Ford who would handle duties on their second record. Johnny Colt played bass on four albums, while drummer Steve Gorman was the other constant through the band's entire first era prior to their 2019 reunion.The early years provided some challenges with a still underage Rich Robinson having to hide out in the car at times before being allowed to come into clubs to play the shows. But eventually George Drakoulias, a staffer at Rick Rubin's Def American label, caught the group playing a New York show and was so impressed that he not only helped to get them their label deal with Def American, he also stepped in to produce Shake Your Money Maker.Splitting time between Atlanta's Soundscape Studios and three different studios in Los Angeles, the now newly renamed Black Crowes laid out their bluesy yet Southern rock inspired record throughout the course of 1989. Speaking of the name change, Chris Robinson told Q Magazine, ""We were really into the Dream Syndicate, the Rain Parade, Green on Red — all those Paisley Underground bands, so we wanted a psychedelic name. When we changed, we kept the Crowes because that's what people called us anyway.""The sessions also provided some stellar assistance, with The Allman Brothers' Chuck Leavell helping out on piano and organ, noted backing singer Laura Creamer helping to accentuate some of the record's chicken skin-raising moments and a young engineer named Brendan O'Brien chipping in on ""a potpourri of instruments.""The Shake Your Money Maker album arrived Feb. 13, 1990, but it wasn't an instant hit. ""Jealous Again"" was the first song released from the record, but it didn't catch fire immediately. Though the song's muscular opening riffs and killer piano backing are fan favorites now, it was a slow build until the track eventually climbed to No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and enjoyed a bit of crossover hitting No. 75 on Billboard's Hot 100.However, people did take notice, picking out influences ranging from '70s-era Rolling Stones to making their Georgia connection to Southern Rock roots. “What Southern rock became is not what the Allmans started out to be. They were creating a new Southern sound. And what we do now is what I’d like Southern rock to become,"" Chris Robinson told Rolling Stone, adding, “But there is a lot of the South in us. I don’t know exactly what it is. Maybe it’s just that we’re a little closer to the ground. We have no pretensions about what we do. We’re just a little earthier. We do things a little slower, more casual.”Black Crowes, ""Jealous Again""The second single, a cover of Otis Redding's soul classic ""Hard to Handle,"" was the song that helped the group really start to see things take off. Drakoulias in an interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution recalled pushing for a cover on the record. ""I thought we should do a cover (on the album), and I think Chris came up with 'Hard to Handle.' I think he was kind of reluctant to doing Otis (Redding) and I said, 'We’ll make it into a rock thing.' I was reading the review (of the album) in Spin magazine and they quoted the song and said, 'Pure poetry from Chris Robinson.' (Laughs) We had an opportunity to expose kids to Otis and this amazing song and put this music out in the world.""Indeed, ""Hard to Handle"" was a rocked up version of the Otis original — an easily memorable guitar line, an undeniable beat and Robinson's hoarse but swagger-filled delivery that made listeners want to heed the calling of the album's title. The song topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and became their first Top 40 hit climbing to No. 26 on the Hot 100.Black Crowes, ""Hard to Handle""Keeping the rocking momentum going, ""Twice as Hard"" came next. The bluesy bend of the guitars and Chris Robinson's powerful belting provided more of an anthemic track for the band. Though not as big as its predecessor, ""Twice as Hard"" would hit No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart and would be the last harder rocking single from the record.The Black Crowes, ""Twice as Hard""While Black Crowes were starting to hit their stride with the listening audience, there were some critical of the group mining familiar territory, but that didn't bother Chris Robinson any.“What is original?"" the singer remarked to Rolling Stone. “I’m not going to bang two badger carcasses together and recite poetry and say, ‘Hey, here’s the new thing.’ We sing a traditional type of music in a very untraditional way. It’s country music, and blues and R&B and other things. It’s ethnic music. That’s what we do.”Still, after a trio of bluesy rock bangers to make listeners stand up and take notice, the group showed their softer side, digging into their teen years output and finally sharing the acoustic guitar-leaning and soulful ""She Talks to Angels"" with the masses.While the song deals with a darker theme of drug use, it was penned during a period when the Robinson brothers had yet to really experiment with their future excesses. ""'She Talks to Angels' is about a girl I kind of knew in Atlanta who was a goth girl who was into heroin, so I made up a story about what if that was your girl,"" said Chris Robinson in their 2010 Croweology video series. ""I didn’t really know about that stuff except from afar at that time, which is probably why that song has a sincere relationship to a dark subject.”Indeed the song was able to connect. The video became an MTV hit and song inspired many fans to sing along to the heartfelt aches dripping from Robinson's voice. ""She Talks to Angels"" became their second chart-topper on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, hit No. 30 on Billboard's Hot 100 and opened the door for the band to a lot of new avenues, especially with acoustic ""unplugged""-type material really finding popularity at the time.Black Crowes, ""She Talks to Angels""The band would release one more single, the heartbreak-inducing ""Seeing Things"" before concluding their radio promotion, but in all honesty they could've gone even further down the rabbit hole with killer tracks such as ""Sister Luck"" and ""Could I've Been So Blind"" still remaining favorites in the catalog despite never being issued as singles.By the time all was said and done, Shake Your Money Maker had hit No. 4 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart, but more importantly, it had provided a different voice in the rock world.“Sometimes I feel like we’re carrying the flag,” Chris Robinson declared in a 1991 Rolling Stone interview. ”One part of it is, we were in the right place at the right time for our thing. But here’s a band that people check out on MTV or in Rolling Stone and realize: ‘Yeah, they say what they really wanna say and play what they really wanna. What a novel concept! That rock 'n' roll can be interesting and feel good and be a real living, breathing animal ... Then again, maybe it’s just that we play some songs and people like ’em.”In the years since its release, Shake Your Money Maker has been certified five times platinum, so yeah, people ""liked 'em.""Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the '90s";2022-02-13;https://loudwire.com/black-crowes-shake-your-money-maker-album-anniversary/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE32YEARSAGO:BLACKCROWESRELEASE'SHAKEYOURMONEYMAKER'
Loudwire;Joe Elliott - 'Bryan Adams Could Easily Be a Member of Def Leppard';The singer reflects on the similarities in their sounds.;"Can you imagine Bryan Adams fronting Def Leppard? Joe Elliott can. The Def Leppard vocalist addressed the idea while reflecting on a period in which he was critical of the Canadian rocker of delivering a sound that he felt was very similar to his own band, criticism that he now regrets.As Ultimate Classic Rock points out, he topic came up while Elliott was a guest on The Mitch Lafon and Jeremy White Show, with the Def Leppard vocalist noting the common tie between his band and Adams' 1991 album Waking up the Neighbours being their producer Mutt Lange.GET DEF LEPPARD TICKETS HEREFor a little refresher, Lange had worked with Def Leppard on 1981's High 'N' Dry, 1983's Pyromania and 1987's Hysteria, a very successful period for the group. But Adams had Lange in the studio working on Waking Up the Neighbours between March 1990 and June 1991, while Def Leppard were in a four-year stretch working with Mike Shipley on 1992's Adrenalize album.White set the stage, asking Elliott his thoughts on the classic Adams album. ""I got into a bit of trouble with this one,"" the singer says. ""I thought it sounded a bit close to the bone.""""Bryan was a little bit pissed at me and fair play to him, he should've been,"" the singer continued before explaining, ""But what it is, it's exactly the same as how High 'N' Dry sounded like AC/DC. What you've got is you've got the same producer, possibly using the same engineer, in the same studio.""""When we did High 'n' Dry, Mutt put Rick [Allen]'s drums exactly where Phil Rudd's drums were, using the same mics to mic them up. We probably used the same cabs and amps that Angus and Malcolm [Young] used that Steve [Clark] and Pete [Willis] used. So there's going to be a thing where somebody says High 'n' Dry sounds like Highway to Hell. Well, touche — it does.""Elliott then shares his regret over his initial criticism at the time, stating, ""So I mouthed off a little bit too much there and I've apologized profusely to Bryan many times since. But that's the Mutt Lange factor. You know, Bryan Adams could easily be a member of Def Leppard, He could be the singer of Def Leppard. There's a cross-pollination cause he's a pop-rock artist and he works with the same producer that we did. We're a pop-rock band.""READ MORE: Why 1991 Had the Best 6-Month Release Period in Rock + Metal HistoryHe then adds, ""Eras do sound similar. Put on a '60s CD and there's loads of bands that sound like The Beatles. Put on a '70s CD and there's loads of bands that sound like Zeppelin or Deep Purple or whatever. And in the '80s, it got ridiculous. So, yeah, there's a similarity, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was a really good record.""The singer then laughingly concludes, ""I'm probably a little bit jealous some of those songs weren't on our record.""Adams' Waking Up the Neighbours album went on to yield seven charting songs around the world, including the Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves soundtrack chart-topper ""(Everything I Do) I Do It for You"" as well as more rocked up singles ""Can't Stop This Thing We Started,"" ""There Will Never Be Another Tonight,"" ""Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven"" and ""Do I Have to Say the Words.""Def Leppard, meanwhile, kept their momentum going in March 1992 when Adrenalize yielded six charting songs of its own, led by ""Let's Get Rocked,"" ""Make Love Like a Man,"" ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"" and ""Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion).""You might catch some of those Def Leppard classics on tour as the band is carrying over their touring with Stadium Tour mates Motley Crue into 2023.

Loudwire;Green Day Are Selling a Limited Edition 'Nimrod 45' Shirt Featuring Trump's Mugshot;Proceeds are going to a great cause.;Green Day are known for being satirical and political (often at the same time). Over the weekend, they doubled down on that fact by offering a new item in their official store: a “Nimrod 45” t-shirt featuring the recently released mugshot of former President Donald Trump.Last Friday (Aug. 25), the band shared an image of the shirt on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, clarifying: “Good Riddance. The ultimate Nimrod shirt is available for 72 hours only. Limited edition shirt proceeds will be donated to T̶h̶e̶ ̶G̶i̶u̶l̶i̶a̶n̶i̶ ̶L̶e̶g̶a̶l̶ ̶D̶e̶f̶e̶n̶s̶e̶ ̶F̶u̶n̶d̶ Greater Good Music, which brings food to those affected by the Maui wildfires.”You can see the post below:Considering that they stipulate a 72-hour time constraint, the shirt will likely only be available until sometime on Aug. 28. As of this writing, though, it can still be preordered from the group’s official merch store for $35, with a specified availability date of Sept. 29, 2023. It can be purchased in sizes ranging from S (small) to 3XL, too.Understandably, reactions to the merchandise and social media posts have been mixed, if not outright contentious.For instance, someone on Instagram wrote: “This . . . is why I love Green Day,” whereas another user declared: “He [Trump] is the Best president you americans have had in decades.” Across all platforms, people are also accusing the group of being “sellouts,” “part of the establishment now” and the like.READ MORE: Where 20 Rock + Metal Band Names Come FromAs alluded to above, the iconic trio's overt stance shouldn't be surprising. After all, punk music is rooted in political and social commentaries, and Green Day have made their views increasingly explicit and emblematic since 2004’s American Idiot (if not earlier).As one person concluded:It's actually hilarious to see multiple people who I've been internet friends with for years now shocked at this. Y'all have seen Green Day how many times over how many years? And you're mad/shocked about this? If they're truly your favorite band, you would know where they stand and how they've vocalized their political beliefs since 2004.Aside from the obvious implication, another reason why Green Day may’ve used 1997’s Nimrod, in particular, is because of the re-release it received earlier this year (to celebrate its 25th anniversary). After all, it was quite an expensive box set.As for the mugshot itself (CNBC reported on Aug. 25), it was taken when Trump was “booked at the Fulton County jail Thursday night [Aug. 24] on state charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.” CNBC added: “Trump is facing charges in four separate criminal cases, but this is the first time he had a mugshot taken.”Political disagreements and all notwithstanding, at least the proceeds of the t-shirt are going to a great cause, right?16 of the Most Political Rock + Metal BandsOutspoken artists championing causes!;2023-08-27;https://loudwire.com/green-day-selling-nimrod-shirt-trump-mugshot/;2023-08-30;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREGREENDAYARESELLINGALIMITEDEDITION'NIMROD45'SHIRTFEATURINGTRUMP'SMUGSHOT
Loudwire;Red Hot Chili Peppers Reveal Release Plans for Second 2022 Studio Album;The funk/alt rock quartet just announced their 13th studio record.;It was only this past April when Red Hot Chili Peppers put out their twelfth studio LP – Unlimited Love – yet they’re already gearing up to release its successor, Return of the Dream Canteen, this October.They made the announcement during last night’s (July 23) performance at Denver’s Empower Field (as part of their current North American and European stadium tour), clarifying that it’s set to drop on Oct. 14 via Warner Records.Naturally, Return of the Dream Canteen will be another double album, and it’ll even see the return of revered producer Rick Rubin.Red Hot Chili Peppers, Return of the Dream Canteen ArtworkWarner RecordsWarner Recordsloading...Of the quick turnaround, the quartet explain:We went in search of ourselves as the band that we have somehow always been. Just for the fun of it we jammed and learned some old songs. Before long we started the mysterious process of building new songs. A beautiful bit of chemistry meddling that had befriended us hundreds of times along the way. Once we found that slip stream of sound and vision, we just kept mining. With time turned into an elastic waist band of oversized underwear, we had no reason to stop writing and rocking. It felt like a dream. When all was said and done, our moody love for each other and the magic of music had gifted us with more songs than we knew what to do with. Well we figured it out. 2 double albums released back to back. The second of which is easily as meaningful as the first or should that be reversed. 'Return of the Dream Canteen' is everything we are and ever dreamed of being. It's packed.While this announcement may seem like a total surprise, they actually alluded to it back in February.Specifically, frontman Anthony Kiedis remarked, “We're gonna put out music by the handful. Literally. Don't be surprised if another wheelbarrow of songs comes your way in the near future.” Plus, guitarist John Frusciante (who returned to RHCP in 2019 following a ten-year absence) commented that the newer tunes will have “a relaxed energy that’s distinct from the intensity of [Unlimited Love].”Considering their enthusiasm for the project – as well as the significant amount of positive press that Unlimited Love received – it’s fair to expect that Return of the Dream Canteen will be just as enjoyable.In the meantime, you can still catch RHCP on their current tour.

Loudwire;Bob Rock Clarifies Comments on Nikki Sixx's Early Motley Crue Bass Playing in New Statement;The producer offers context and insight clarifying his remarks.;"Producer Bob Rock has issued a new statement following comments made on the Talk Is Jericho podcast (heard below) in which he shared a story about working with Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx in the early days of the band in which the bassist questioned whether or not he had actually played on the band's first four albums. In the new statement, Rock explains the context in which those comments were made, chalking it up to Sixx joking around in a self-deprecating style.While appearing on the podcast, Rock recalled, ""[While making] 'Dr. Feelgood', [Nikki] says to me, he goes, 'I don't think I ever played on any of the Motley Crue records. I think somebody came in at night and replaced all my parts.' He says, 'So I don't really know how to play bass.'""Get Motley Crue Tickets Here""And I said, 'Too bad. You're playing bass on it,'"" the producer continues, ""So I worked with him through 'Dr. Feelgood,' did a lot of edits and made him play every note.""Rock would later share how Sixx has continued to improve as a player over the course of his career. ""When we did The Dirt [soundtrack], the songs on The Dirt, I went to see him and we started working on the demos. He picked up the bass and started playing, and I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on here?' He had been taking bass lessons for five years,"" revealed Rock. ""All of a sudden he's an amazing bass player. And I think that's so cool, in that point of his career, he wanted to be better. I admire that. So now, on The Dirt, Nikki and Tommy [Lee] played live off the floor, both of them.""In October of 2021, Sixx himself opened up about taking guitar, bass and vocal lessons before the pandemic and that he even learned to play bass with his fingers, as he had been using a pick up that point.Now, to offer a clarification of what was said on the podcast and the context in which is was shared, Rock issued a statement that reads as follows:Yesterday on a podcast with Chris Jericho I told a story about working with Nikki Sixx and Motley Crue on the Dr. Feelgood record. Unfortunately, like many things on the Internet today, it was taken out of context and misconstrued. When I began working with Motley Crue on the Dr. Feelgood record, the band was sober for the first time and Nikki particularly was recovering from a very public addiction to heroin. We joked around a lot and Nikki, in his very self-deprecating style would say he didn’t even remember playing on their prior records. This was Nikki’s way of saying that for the record we were working on, he was showing up to do the best he possibly could and to make the best record of the band’s career. Which we did. At no time did I ever actually think Nikki didn’t play bass on Motley Crue’s records. He’s one of the most unique and talented players in the world and his approach to the instrument is part of what has made Motley Crue great throughout the years.Lastly, I was commenting on and commending Nikki because he never stops learning and never stops improving. I respect Nikki for always wanting to be better at his craft and it shows. I have worked with some of the biggest bands in the world and I can say unequivocally that Nikki Sixx is one of the most talented players, lyricists and songwriters I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. And if the Internet wants to latch onto a story from one or two sound bytes, its extremely unfortunate because it doesn’t reflect the truth of the contributions he’s made to music over the last 40 years.Mahalo - Bob RockREAD MORE: 10 Huge Rock + Metal Bands Whose Singer Isn't the Primary LyricistRock has continued his working relationship with Motley Crue of late, most recently working with Sixx, newly added guitarist John 5 and drummer Tommy Lee on new material.Motley Crue have returned to the road, once again playing alongside Def Leppard in a continuation of last year's North American ""Stadium Tour"" that is now hitting other parts of the globe.

Loudwire;Soundgarden's 'Superunknown': 10 Facts Only Superfans Would Know;Superunknown facts about 'Superunknown.';"""No one sings like you anymore.""29 years ago today, Seattle rockers Soundgarden released their massively successful album Superunknown. They'd already released three full-length studio albums, but this fourth effort was the one that really catapulted them into rock superstardom.Sadly, the aforementioned lyric from ""Black Hole Sun"" holds painfully true today. While we miss Chris Cornell and still hope we'll eventually get to hear that seventh record the band was working on when he died, we wanted to reflect on one of the greatest albums of the 1990s to commemorate the anniversary.Here are 10 facts you may not have known about the masterpiece, Superunknown.1. Soundgarden had already been around for 10 years.That's right, kids, Nirvana weren't actually first. Soundgarden were initially a trio when they formed in 1984, featuring Cornell on vocals and drums, Kim Thayil on guitar and Hiro Yamamoto on bass, who Ben Shepherd would later replace. They became a four-piece band two years later when Matt Cameron joined on drums, to allow Cornell to focus more on his vocals and rhythm guitar. Superunknown was their fourth full-length album.2. It's their most successful album to date.1991's Badmotorfinger is known for being Soundgarden's breakthrough album, spawning the hits ""Rusty Cage"" and ""Outshined,"" but Superunknown was really the one that broke them into the mainstream and gave them their most commercial success. Often compared to Nirvana's Nevermind and Alice in Chains' Dirt as one of the most influential albums of the '90s, the album debuted at No. 1 and has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA. It's home to the massive songs ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman,"" which each won a Grammy.A&MA&Mloading...3. It was their transition from metal to rock.Let's be real here — none of the '90s rock bands were called ""grunge"" right when things exploded. Soundgarden was actually considered a metal band before ""grunge"" became a household term to describe the somber alternative rock coming out of the West Coast, primarily Seattle. Badmotorfinger had previously been nominated for a Best Metal Performance Grammy, and it makes sense.The songs were heavy, as were the ones on 1988's Ultramega OK and 1989's Louder than Love. Superunknown showed Soundgarden crafting a much more formal song structure that was more suitable for rock radio, with follow-up Down on the Upside following suit.4. The name was inspired by a clown.The name ""Superunknown"" was inspired by a clown named J.P. Patches, the main character of the self-titled children's television show in Seattle in the 1970s. A film adaptation was later made of the show, while the movie's cassette was named Superklown. Cornell admitted to Rolling Stone that he glanced at the sleeve of the cassette one morning in the '90s when he was hungover, and thought it read ""Superunknown."" The rest was history.YouTube - J.P. PatchesYouTube - J.P. Patchesloading...5. They had no idea ""Black Hole Sun"" would become so huge.If you ever meet someone who doesn't know who Soundgarden is, all you have to say is ""Black Hole Sun,"" before dropkicking them for their poor taste. According to Cornell, Soundgarden was unsure of even putting the song out at all, let alone it becoming their biggest hit. ""I don’t think any of us...thought it would be a single. If you read the lyrics to the verses, it’s sort of a surreal, esoteric word painting,"" he told Rolling Stone in 2014. Thayil also referred to it as the ""Dream On"" of their setlist. The video is also very weird.6. ""Like Suicide"" was not a suicide noteTheorists and hardcore fans will always try to dig as deep as they can to solve the mystery of why their musical idol would take their own life. Of course, listening to ""Like Suicide"" now is a bit more disturbing considering how Soundgarden's charming vocalist left this world, but it actually had nothing to do with an actual suicide.Cornell was sitting in a basement writing when he heard a thump and went outside to discover a broken-necked, mangled bird that had flown into his window. ""My last ditch / Was my last brick / Lent to finish her"" refers to the brick he used to end its suffering.""I heard a thud against the window, and it was a female robin that had fallen into the window and broke her neck, and was just laying there,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""I didn’t know what to do. So I ended up smashing her with a brick, putting her out of her misery. I didn’t want to sit there and watch her suffer. Then when I went back down to finish recording, I decided that would be the lyrics to the song."" Another fun fact — a ""murder"" is a group of crows.7. ""She Likes Surprises"" was only included on the deluxe edition.Surprise! Track 16, ""She Likes Surprises"" was actually left off the original release of the album, but was later included on the deluxe edition that was released in 2014.8. The album cover came from a photo called ""Screaming Elf.""Kevin Westenberg took the legendary distorted photograph that became the cover for the album. The orange blotches are indeed the warped faces of the band atop an upside-down burning forest. The photograph was titled the ""Screaming Elf,"" for reasons Westenberg is unaware of. The photographer shared the story of the shoot on his instagram shortly after Cornell's death, calling the image a ""glorious accident."" He adds, ""I was always disappointed that Matt [Cameron] was cut out of the cover by the crop. Not my choice.""9. Cornell's voice broke microphones recording it.Everyone knows that Cornell had one of the most distinct voices in history. Producer Michael Beinhorn reflected on working on the album with Billboard in 1994, claiming that Cornell had two different vocal ranges, thus requiring several mics to capture them each properly.""We went through endless mic combinations, and when Chris sings high, he tends to sing harder and louder than just about anything on this earth,"" he says. ""He literally blew through a bunch of condenser mics. I've never seen anyone do that before.""10. It was recorded at Bad Animals Studios when it was owned by Heart.Bad Animals Studios is a Seattle recording studio, where Alice in Chains, Nirvana and Neil Young also have recorded. From 1991 to 1997, it was partially owned by Heart sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson, named after their 1987 album. Once they sold their partnership, the name was switched back to ""Studio X.""25 Legendary Rock Albums With No Weak Songs";2023-03-08;https://loudwire.com/soundgarden-superunknown-facts/;2023-03-08;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRESOUNDGARDEN'S'SUPERUNKNOWN':10FACTSONLYSUPERFANSWOULDKNOW

Loudwire;John Bonham's Grandson + Korn's Ray Luzier Team Up on New Pop-Punk Song;Jager Henry Bonham takes lead vocals on the catchy song.;"Jager Henry, grandson of the late, legendary Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has teamed up with Korn skinsman Ray Luzier on the melodic new pop-punk song ""Love Yourself.""The songs stretches just over two minutes and the duo use their time quite efficiently, taking things from a melodic opening with a pounding backbeat, followed by a verse that gradually ticks up in energy before the refrain of ""What would I want to love anyone else / When I can't even love myself / Fucking up my mental health / Wondering if anyone knows now,"" comes soaring over it all.Jager Henry takes front and center on lead vocals, adopting a gruff, weathered tone that will inevitably draw sharp comparisons to another relative pop-punk newcomer, Machine Gun Kelly.""Music is in my blood,"" Jager Henry began. ""Growing up as a second generation musician with a lot to live up to is tough but I chose a slightly different path musically. My voice is my instrument, my genre is a little different too but it’s all rock ‘n’ roll.""Regarding ""Love Yourself,"" he offered, “It is truly about finding love for yourself before portraying toxic love to anyone else.

Loudwire;The Question Ozzy Osbourne Hates Being Asked Over and Over;It's an amateur question.;"In an interview with Billboard, Ozzy Osbourne briefly joked about the one question he hates being asked and, yes, it has to do with bats.In the video further down the page, Billboard chats with Osbourne about his highly-decorated, star-studded new album, Patient Number 9, which has earned four Grammy nominations. The four-and-a-half-minute clip opens on a light-hearted note where the legend confesses that he hates having to answer the question, ""What do bats taste like?""""It's like... for fuck's sake,"" he adds in frustration before the video continues with a formal introduction and the remainder of the Q&A.Ozzy has good reason to be annoyed by this, too. It's not a pleasant memory, although the incident is among the most iconic tales in rock 'n' roll debauchery and Ozzy does have a plush bat toy with a detachable head up for sale.""It's not the way I want to be remembered [but] I know I'll be the man that bit the head off the bat. That will be my epitaph. It won't be, 'Here lies Ozzy Osbourne... he did a bit of good,' it's going to be, 'The bat-biting lunatic,' which... I don't care,"" he lamented in 2020.Also... he's already answered this question in his book!Here's a bit of the backstory on it all:While performing in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 20, 1982, the ""Prince of Darkness"" committed one of the most infamous acts in rock and metal history.In his memoir, I Am Ozzy, he recalls how audiences would routinely toss animals and animal parts onstage, which then shifted toward a trend in plastic/fake toys being lobbed onstage. Mistaking a live bat that was thrown onstage for a toy one, Osbourne recalls, ""Then I did what I always did when we got a rubber toy onstage — CHOMP.""""Immediately though, something felt wrong. Very wrong"" the book continues, ""For a start, my mouth was instantly full of this warm, gloopy liquid, with the worst aftertaste you could ever imagine. I could feel it staining my teeth and running down my chin.""""Then the head in my mouth twitched,"" Osbourne notes, going on to describe the sudden wave of realization that came rushing over him as he learned in that moment that he had actually bitten the head off of a live bat.It's also stated in I Am Ozzy that the singer was brought to the hospital following the incident and a doctor suggested that perhaps the bat was ""stunned"" as a result of being at the concert, leading Osbourne to mistake the motionless creature for a toy.It's safe to say that if Osbourne does manage to go ahead with his 2023 tour dates, there will be no bat-biting. Those long-postponed tour dates appear to be in potential jeopardy, however, as the singer recently told Sirius XM that, six months after his spinal surgery, he still ""can't fucking walk much now."" Even so, he hopes to be able to return to the stage again.Ozzy Osbourne Interview With BillboardThe Real Names of Over 50 Rock + Metal Icons";2022-12-28;https://loudwire.com/question-ozzy-osbourne-hates-being-asked/;2022-12-28;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETHEQUESTIONOZZYOSBOURNEHATESBEINGASKEDOVERANDOVER

Loudwire;Musicians Telling the Truth About 'American Idol';They don't like Simon Cowell either.;American Idol turns 20 this year, but shows like Idol, The X Factor, and The Voice have arguably damaged the fabric of music. Watch Dave Grohl, Corey Taylor and others as they tell the truth about American Idol.“Don’t let someone say, ‘Sorry, you didn’t win the song contest. Go home,’” Dave Grohl expressed to Anderson Cooper on an episode of 60 Minutes. “Who’s to say who’s good or not? Imagine Bob Dylan standing there and singing ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’ in front of those judges. ‘Sorry, it’s a little nasally and a little flat. Next.’”When Cooper pushed Grohl on how he’d change American Idol, the Foo Fighters legend responded, “I would never make it. Never in a heartbeat.”Rage Against the Machine famously ruffled the feathers of Idol/X Factor judge and producer Simon Cowell when “Killing in the Name” became a Christmas No. 1 in the U.K. When asked about Cowell, singer Zack de la Rocha rightfully said, “Simon is an interesting character who seems to have profited greatly off humiliating people on live television.

Loudwire;What Does Corey Taylor Really Think? - New Music, Today's Culture, Capitalism + More;The rocker weighs in on a number of topics while promoting his 'CMF2' album.;"What does Corey Taylor think? You all have asked us so much over the years that it's become a meme. Luckily we recently had the chance to sit down with Taylor for a chat in Los Angeles.The rocker with a voracious appetite for music and a locked and loaded opinion on a variety of topics is set to return on Sept. 15 with his second solo effort, CMF2. And while we spoke with Taylor about his new album, his confidence in the music and his love for the band that he's put around him, the musician also offered up his thoughts on a number of other timely topics going on in the world today as well.We learn a bit about the origins of his Decibel Cooper label imprint name, get some reflections on fatherhood now that his son Griffin is fronting the rising rock band Vended and find out what makes Corey say, ""I will always have something to bitch about. I will always have something to write about, and I will always have something to rail against.""He also serves up some of his favorite collaborations he's done over the years, drops his non-metal DJ favorites and shares the one thing he wishes more people asked him about. So dig in below and find out what Corey Taylor thinks.As someone who loves wordplay, I’m loving that you named your label Decibel Cooper and I’m hoping people get that reference.You know, you’re the only one who has told me that you figured it out. Everyone else is like, “So Decibel, what’s going on?” And I’m like, “Oh, for fuck sake.” The cool thing is that it’s the name of my production company as well. So I was like, “Yeah, we’re just gonna franchise this the fuck out. It’s a great name.”So beyond that, obviously it's a nod to D.B. Cooper, but is there a tie to his legacy with what you’re doing or just that it’s a cool name?No, no, I just thought it was cool. But, so originally I was going to start a ska band called Decibel Cooper. I was really going to lean into the 2-tone, and then I realized I just didn’t have time to start a 12th band. So I thought, “Well this is stupid.” But I kept the name cause the name was fucking great. So when the time came to come up with a name for my imprint, I just thought, “Let’s keep the Decibel Cooper name going and see how far we can get away with it.”Ok, you just blew my mind with Corey Taylor doing a 2-tone ska band. I’d pay to see that. But let’s go there. What was your entry point with ska?It started with The Clash obviously, because The Clash, they just dipped their toes into so many different genres that they just blew my mind. They went from regular three-, four-chord punk to 2-tone ska, and when they leaned into some hip-hop and there was jungle. They just played with so many different vibes. They just inspired me musically so much. They’ve really been the band along with artists like Prince that they just had no boundaries. Those are the artists that I was inspired to be.So when I got into ska or 2-tone, it was obviously The Specials. I love the fucking Specials. Madness were fucking great. There were so many bands that were just unsung back in the day that you look back and go there was so much great music. People don’t even realize that The English Beat, which then became General Public, that they started out as a ska band. “Mirror in the Bathroom” is a fucking incredible song. That right there … I just loved the stylings that was a marriage of reggae, punk and just pub music. I loved that it was creating something AND that it brought people together. That, to me, was just so attractive and it inspired me to want to start something like that.I haven’t said no completely to doing it, but I got a lot going on (laughs).The Clash, ""Rudie Can't Fail""Ok, well The Clash is a perfect example of a band that was all over the place musically and I can see you going that way. With your evolution of putting more and more influences into your music, where you’re at as a solo artist, is this finally where you can do what you want? The expectations are off as you’ve done heavy, you’ve done rock and now this can finally be a blank slate and anything you want it to be.It really is. I’ll start weeping when there are no more worlds left to conquer. I feel like the confidence I got from making the first one and the fact that there was really no plan for it. Let’s just fucking see. I’ve written all the stuff but let’s see where it goes. That really gave me the confidence to go, “Okay, let’s really lean into this now. Let’s see where we can go with this.” And that’s really where CMF2 came from.It’s still dipping my toes into all these different genres and pushing the boundaries but bringing in the elements that I’m known for as well and using them and incorporating them on songs that don’t necessarily lend themselves to that stuff. It’s just kind of playing around and meshing and creating exciting hybrids and seeing what people will think.It was a lot of fun to do and there’s just so much excitement and energy that came from when we were recording it that I knew that we were on the right path.Because you’ve done so many things, is it more of a challenge now to try not to tread back over previous ground or do you maybe go back and say, “Hey, maybe it’s time to revisit something as a touchtone or a jumping off point?”I definitely try not to, even though I could easily do it, I try not to tread the same path too much. There are definitely elements that I love to play with and experiment with but when it comes to lyrics I want to make sure I don’t repeat myself there.If there’s a certain vibe I’m looking for, I will play around with it and if it feels like something I’ve done before, I’ll strip it to the studs and try to start over or I’ll be, “Okay, we’re not going there.” It’s the reason why there’s a lot of songs I’ve recorded but never put out there for people is because they feel too similar to things I’ve done in the past. I never want to be the guy who goes, “Well those songs are really, really similar.” I always want the things that I put out, even if they feel familiar, I never want them to feel similar. There are moments in genres that can reflect one another, but they can never feel identical. You can lean into those spirits and try to create things that feel different and still have them differentiate themselves from each other.Corey Taylor, ""Beyond""This band you’ve got now. Sounds tight, sounds great.Dude, they’re AMAZING.And I know there’s some crossover from Stone Sour with Christian Martucci on board. But what are you thoughts on the band you’ve pulled together for your solo work and is this “THE BAND” for you?This is definitely “The Band.” I hand-picked these guys. They were dudes who I absolutely loved playing with. I loved spending time with them. I loved playing onstage with them. I loved creating with them. I just know that if I throw a style at them, they can play it. These guys, they’re not hired guns. But they are guys that have experience playing a million styles and being really able to excel at every style.That’s one of the reasons why I picked them. I knew if I was going to do a solo thing, it was going to incorporate everything. At one point, I was going to play Slipknot, I was going to play Stone Sour and I was going to do these covers that maybe come out of left field. We can play around with it and have it reflect whatever, but I was going to play around when it came to this solo thing so I just needed people who were exceptional when it came to musicianship. And the stuff that they come up with creatively, it’s fantastic.One of my favorite songs on here is “Post Traumatic Blues,” and I know that it deals with PTSD, which is something you’ve decided to align yourself with in your charitable pursuits. I wanted to give you a chance to talk about your involvement with PTSD and why that became something of personal interest for you.“Post Traumatic Blues” was definitely inspired by the work that I do with the Taylor Foundation. I started the Taylor Foundation not only as a tribute to my grandfather but also to my grandmother. My grandfather was veteran of the Korean War and he came home from that war severely affected by PTSD. It triggered crippling alcoholism in him, which destroyed their marriage and it pretty much destroyed any relationship that my sister and I would have had with our grandfather.It was to the point where for the longest time I didn’t even realize he was my grandfather. He was just this man that my mom brought me to visit who just lived in other people’s houses or lived on the street. It was sad. There was no support system back then. There was the VA and there was nothing else because people didn’t want to acknowledge the fact that our servicemen were coming home with incredible invisible scars that they couldn’t understand.As time went on, I dealt with my own issues with trauma and I was able to meet with people who had served or people in law enforcement and emergency services where our music had really helped them. And I realized that something I was really starting to formulate was a passion to help organizations who are trying to help them. And I’m not talking about just national organizations as they tend to get the majority of the press. This is more about the local places, the real boots on the ground in all of these states that people may or may not even know about because nobody hears about them.So the Taylor Foundation is really about not only just raising money for those organizations but also raising awareness about them and helping to boost their signal so that people in their area can know about it. These are groups that maybe take different creative ways of helping people who are dealing with PTSD. It’s mainly servicemen or veterans, current or former, people in law enforcement, people in emergency services and their families, because PTSD is something that affects the whole family. It’s trying to build awareness for families who are dealing with it, it’s trying help acknowledge it and accept it and make it so everyone can help each other.We’ve been able to raise a lot money and distribute it to a lot of great organizations, and we’re doing some really great work.Corey Taylor, ""Post Traumatic Blues""One of the great things over the last few years is seeing Griffin come along from that kid hopping onstage with Slipknot to now fronting his own band. I’ve seen you discuss the struggle of not being around as much as you’d like because of work when he was younger and trying to find that balance, and I think it’s something that a lot of fathers in everyday life can relate to as well. Can you talk about finding that balance in your life and getting to the point where you are in the relationship now?It’s been a long time coming obviously. There were some decisions in my life that took me away from him even longer than I would have liked. I don’t have a lot of regrets in my life, but one of my regrets is that I wasn’t there more for him.He and I butted heads for a while, but obviously you’re going to do that with teenagers anyway most of the time. But with Griff, it was the fact that I wasn’t there. I wasn’t there to answer a lot of questions. Now that he’s gotten older, we communicate a little better. And we understand each other a little more, which is great.He understands, especially going on the road now, how much work it is. He sees and he feels how heavy it is when you’re not home, when you’re away from home and away from your family. So he understands what I went through cause there wasn’t a second of his life that I wasn’t thinking about him or wishing I could be there for him. Because he knows that now, it’s deepened our relationship, which is great.He was just here. He came to Vegas and spent two weeks with us and we were able to go to Hawaii as a family, which was great. He’d never been and his sister had never been. My wife and I were able to take them and really have a great time as a family. And he really appreciated that — the fact that we include him and we want him there.So I think that has given us so much more room to grow as father and son. And it certainly doesn’t hurt that I’m so proud of him for what he’s done. He knows that no matter what, I’ve got his back. It’s little things like that that helps. They’re never going to really truly understand how much you love them maybe until they have kids of their own. But you can come close, let’s put it that way.I just thought it was so awesome that someone had caught you on a video side of the stage at one of his shows with just this huge smile on your face ….Oh, I’m the worst, dude. I’m such a doting dad, and I’m sure people clowned me hard for it, but I don’t care, man. The great thing is that I have video from back when Griff was probably 10 or 12 of him standing on the side of the stage with me and giving me waters and stuff and he was my little security dude, and now I do the same for him.If we’re ever at the same place and he’s playing, I’m at the side of the stage no matter what for his show just so I can watch him. I’m just so proud of him, and he’s so goddamn good.READ MORE: Slipknot Members Can't Help But Smile Watching Their Sons PerformThis comes from one of our readers, but I liked the question, so I’ll ask …. Beyond your music and family, what inspires you the most in your life to push forward?Oh man, good question. There’s not a lot of room for anything else (laughs). Family takes up the rest of it, and I’m constantly writing music and working on stuff.I guess my whole thing, especially the last six years, it’s really important to me to make sure that the people that I appreciate, that they know it. I’ve definitely had moments in my life where I’ve been more selfish than most. I’ve also had moments where I’ve not made sure that the people who have helped me immensely in my life know [how I felt]. I wasn’t able to show that appreciation.So I guess my new dedication, well it’s not that new — about six years now — is to make sure that the people I care about know it. No holding back, no censoring myself, no “it’s not the right time,” no. I just make sure that it happens and I make sure that it’s said because you just never fucking know.I’ve lost so many people in my life who may or may not have understood how much I appreciated them. And I’m not going to let that opportunity ever go by again. I won’t bore anybody with hobbies, cause I’ve got enough of them to kill somebody, but what I’ve tried to incorporate is a sense of urgency in making sure that the people I care about in my life know it.So we’ll take this in another direction since it’s been nice and touchy-feely here, but given that you are in a good place in life, does it become harder with age and peace to channel that anger and aggression that comes with some of your music?Oh God, no! I’m still a fucking asshole. There’s still so many things that piss me off it’s not even funny. Just the state of the culture right now is so fucking awful. People are now talking to each other like they are tweeting, which is ridiculous. One of the things that I miss the most are facts — not just contentious opinion or alternative facts or whatever the fuck that shit means.The fact that we don’t have any base level foundation for what is correct and what is not correct and that everything is open to opinion is just horse shit. And that those opinions are then taken by people who have been made to feel inferior by elitist pricks and they’ve now taken those opinions and they’ve cemented them as their own facts and they’ve passed them off to people who feel the same way. The fact that we have no baseline in reality now is terrifying. The fact that there’s nowhere we can go to find things that we can rely on and the fact that there’s no real urgency to do that.The fact that there’s no real place to find something that is secure and is set in stone. Yes, there may be changes on the different data that comes in, but is something that feels secure. More people are more interested in their own drama and their own bullshit and their own version of conspiracies and ridiculous fucking propaganda that they refuse to see that what they’re doing is eating themselves. They’re eating their own culture. Whether it’s the right and their obsession with the talking heads or the left and their obsession with controlling language and controlling the way that we try to feel about each other and the way that you talk about other fucking people, regardless, it’s insane.Because of that, I will always have something to bitch about. I will always have something to write about, and I will always have something to rail against.Yeah, and you’ve also got the odd social conduct nowadays. It’s like people forgot how to act with throwing stuff at performers onstage that we’ve seen here lately….Oh, it’s fucking ridiculous. This is one of the problems with social media. Now artists aren’t regarded as people anymore. Even if they never were, they were still regarded as something that is flesh and bone. They were something to obsess about, but at least they were a person.Now, because of the feeling of being even more removed from the human experience, now, you might as well just be a fucking soda machine or a phone booth for fuck sake. You’re an object, and you’re going to be treated as such.And the fact that people can’t understand how utterly dangerous it is to do shit like that, how utterly rude it is to treat people like that, how utterly incredible it is to think that you are so special that the show is just about you and not about anybody else around you …. the level of entitlement that is being brought out in people is fucking disgusting.Everybody wants to just talk about how wrong it is, but nobody wants to talk about why. It’s because nobody’s looking at anyone as a human being anymore. They’re not looking at the artist anymore. They’re not looking at each other anymore like that. And until we bring the human element back into it, there will be no boundaries. That’s what it is. It’s a destruction of boundaries.Now people see that they can be disregarded and they’re going to get a reaction and they’re going to have something that they can tweet about again, it’s just one giant sucking black hole that looks like a massive asshole just sucking the whole universe into it. It’s dumb.Corey Taylor, CMF2 Album ArtworkCorey Taylor, 'CMF2'Decibel Cooper/BMGloading...What’s the one thing people ask you about that you wish they’d stop?I don’t know. It seems like it goes in phases. I don’t know. I guess I just have to open my mouth again in the wrong way and then people will just chase me on that. (Laughs)Okay, then the flip side of that is what’s the one thing you never get asked that you wish you would?I kind of get to talk about everything. Regardless of if someone even asks me, my mouth is big enough to handle so many different topics.But here’s something I wish more people would talk about. The fact that growth in business has become more about an addiction than it is about real economic stability. I’ve heard this problem with people trying to defend capitalism for years. The problem is that the business people have convinced themselves that unless they’re showing growth or unless they’re showing a profit, a growing profit, that they’re not actually succeeding and that is absolutely incorrect.Stability is still profitability. Stability is still success. I would rather have something stable than something that fucking climbs constantly and then it just goes right off the brink of destruction. That’s one of the reasons why we see people doing these mass layoffs. It’s one of the reasons we see people destroying the quality of the products that are coming out. It’s one of the reasons we’re seeing people become glutted on wealth and then they themselves become oblivious to what the human fucking condition is.Look at all these billionaires talking out of their fucking ass about people and they have no idea what real life is. They’re walking around a landscape of money, wealth and bullshit and they can’t even understand what it is to fucking pay bills or to choose between feeding your kids and making a fucking car payment.The fact that they’re defending capitalism against that is excruciating. It doesn’t make any sense and it sends the wrong message about what the American Dream should have been in the first place. When the American Dream was first talked about, it was about the opportunity to have a family, to feed your kids, to have a house and to make a living. End of fucking story. Now the American Dream has been bastardized into some fucking vile thought that whoever is richest last wins. It’s such horse shit, and I wish people would ask me about that so I could say it and piss off more of these fucking asshats.I know you’ve probably been asked “best album” at some point, but what I want to know is through all of the collaborations, bands and projects, what was the most personally rewarding recording musically you feel you’ve done from start to finish?I’ve been trying to think about this today, cause I’ve done so many projects and so many cool things over the years.The songs that I did with Tech [N9ne] were amazing. Just the fact that he was down to let me go off and do my thing. “Wither” is just such a great song. People always get surprised when they realize how old that song is now. That thing came out like 10 years ago or something like that.I’m pretty proud of a lot of stuff. One of the first collaborations I ever did was with Max [Cavalera] on Soulfly II when we did “Jumpdafuckup” together. The fact that he was asking to do a tune with me blew my mind. We were still very young. In fact, the first album, we were still touring on that.They wanted me to come down to the studio and I basically wrote what I did on the road leading up to that recording session in Phoenix. I met him that day. We had a blast together and we just fucking banged it out and we just looked at each other like giddy fucking little kids going, “Fuck, this is so fucking cool.”To me, it’s still one of the favorite things I ever did cause that song, it fucking pounds dude. Especially the last half of it is just so in your face. It’s some of my favorite flow that I ever wrote. Just all of it and all the crazy shit that we were able to do together. And Max is just such a great dude that the handful of times that we’ve had to do it live, it was just so much fun, man.Soulfly Featuring Corey Taylor, ""Jumpdafuckup""We’ve seen some of your backstage antics and dancing and singing along to songs. One of our readers was asking, what’s the most un-metal song that you just love to turn up and crank as loud as you can and sing when nobody else is watching?Aw dude. I turn it on whether people are watching or not. I don’t give a shit.What was I playing for the boys? They tend to give me the speaker backstage at the Slipknot shows. They let me play DJ because they know I’m going to put on some weird-ass shit whether it’s Frank Zappa or the Bee Gee’s.I did an ‘80s playlist, all early ‘80s that was just all new wave weird shit. Some fo them were looking at me like, “What the fuck is this?” I did a whole Flock of Seagulls thing and it wasn’t even “I Ran,” it was “Space Age Love Song,” which is an incredible song. I love that song. It’s one of those songs you can just sign along to and you just start smiling as you do it.But then there was stuff like [Animotion’s] “Obsession,” which I always thought would be a great song for Slipknot to do a cover of because there’s percussion and riffs that you could really lean into and you could make it really creepy, right? But other than that, fuck, I’ll do the Chicken Dance. I don’t give a shit.A Flock of Seagulls, ""Space Age Love Song""Our thanks to Corey Taylor for the interview.

Loudwire;Slipknot Fans Have Given the New Mystery Member a Nickname;First was Tortilla Man, now...;"Slipknot have undergone quite a few lineup changes throughout their career, and every time someone new joins the band, they keep their identity hidden for as long as possible. Well, the fans have now given the new mystery member, who replaced longtime keyboardist Craig Jones, a nickname.Hidden identities have been part of Slipknot's shtick since the late '90s, with some of the members first showing their unmasked faces publicly in the early 2000s. As members came and went, they repeated the process, especially with Alessandro ""V-Man"" Venturella and Jay Weinberg, who both joined the Iowa group in 2014.When Chris Fehn parted ways with the 'Knot in 2019, they recruited a new member by the time they released the video for ""Unsainted,"" which was the first track they shared from the album We Are Not Your Kind. The internet quickly nicknamed the new member ""Tortilla Man,"" as his first mask actually kind of resembled a crispy tortilla. Now, the games have started all over again.Slipknot announced the departure of Jones in early June, and shortly after, they shared an image of the new mystery member on their social media without any further context. The new keyboardist has played a bunch of shows with the band since then, and Slipknot fans have come up with a couple of theories as to who they think the unidentified musician may be.It took Slipknot almost three years to formally reveal the identity of Tortilla Man as Michael Pfaff, though fans had been speculating he was behind the mask for a while. Regardless, even if fans are able to uncover the identity of this new member, if they stick to their old ways, we won't have an official confirmation for a while. So, fans came up with a nickname for the new guy in the meantime, just like they did with Pfaff.Greg. Greg Bones.The Gimp, Leatherface, Zipper Dude and Hoodie Guy were among the popular contenders for the musician's nickname, but the comment on a Reddit post that received the most upvotes said ""Greg Bones,"" likely because of how similar it sounds to Craig Jones.""Be careful here maggots, what we say will stick. Tortilla Man was named and identified thanks to this sub,"" someone commented on the initial post.READ MORE: Who Is Slipknot's New Mystery Member? - 4 Keyboard Players With Ties to the BandA bunch of other fans just commented ""Greg"" in return, so it stuck, and now nearly every post on the Slipknot Reddit page about the new member has referred to him as Greg. Coincidentally, there actually was a Greg in Slipknot at one point — Greg Welts, whose nickname was Cuddles. He was in the band for about a year after Anders Colsefni's departure in 1997, and he was known for wearing a baby mask onstage.Cuddles was replaced by Brandon Darner, who was eventually succeeded by Fehn, though Darner wore the original mask with the Pinocchio-like nose.

Loudwire;Korn's Jonathan Davis Reveals Song That Steered His Love To Rock;Gotta 'love' this one.;"He's not fooling! When it came to finding a love for rock, Korn's Jonathan Davis says there was one song in particular that provided his initial musical ""schooling."" That track was Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love.""The song was released as the lead single off Led Zeppelin's second album, 1969's Led Zeppelin II, just over a year and two months before Davis was born. But as the song had captured plenty of ears by that point, it's not a surprise that it was in his father's collection and played an integral role in introducing young Jonathan to music.While speaking with Scott Lipps for Spin's Lipps Service (as seen below), Davis recalled gravitating to the song through his father's music choices. ""The first time I remember any kind of rock thing, that I remember that sparked me was when I heard 'Whole Lotta Love' from Led Zeppelin. I put that record on and that kind of like, 'wow.' That grabbed me somehow, and that sent me down that like 'oh, I want to check [this out].' I was very, very young.""And while that vinyl would be very influential to Davis, so would the console that it was played on. ""I actually have that console still to this day that I heard that first Led Zeppelin record on. I keep it and when I want to be inspired, that's like an object that totally inspired me from my childhood that I still ... I have it in the studio. Sometimes I go sit and just stare, touch it just get some inspiration because it's like a good luck charm for me.""As previously stated, ""Whole Lotta Love"" was the lead single off Led Zeppelin II, the second album released by the band within that calendar year. The song rose to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has become a gold-selling single in the U.S. Revisit that classic cut that influenced a young Jonathan Davis just below the interview clip.Korn's Jonathan Davis Speaks With Spin's Lipps ServiceLed Zeppelin, ""Whole Lotta Love""19 Songs Led Zeppelin Never Played Live";2022-04-11;https://loudwire.com/korn-jonathan-davis-song-steered-love-rock/;2022-04-14;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREKORN'SJONATHANDAVISREVEALSSONGTHATSTEEREDHISLOVETOROCK

I had a poster of AFI … and Davey [Havok] was wearing a SOM shirt, and so, as was often the case back then, I went on the hunt to find the music that had inspired my favorite musicians. The very first song I heard by SOM was the '92 version of 'Temple of Love' and I became obsessed.""He adds, ""We've talked about doing a BVB version of this song for years and when given the opportunity to collaborate with fellow SOM fan and goth-rock icon VV, it seems liked the perfect situation. We are thrilled with how it turned out and hope that anyone who's familiar with the track enjoys our spin on it and those who have never heard the original enjoy it and maybe this will lead them down the path to the greatness that is SOM like that poster of AFI did.""Black Veil Brides continues to tour behind 2021's The Phantom Tomorrow as well as their 2022 EP, The Mourning.

Loudwire;Dave Sabo Explains Why 'None of Us' in Skid Row Want to Reunite With Sebastian Bach;Bach last sang for Skid Row in 1997.;"It's a new year and if 2023 is anything like 2022, it's going to be full of more reunions, just don't count on Skid Row getting back together with classic singer Sebastian Bach anytime soon. And happiness is a big factor.""It's not even a part of any sort of thought process,"" Sabo says of the reunion idea in an interview with We Go to 11 that took place in September (transcription via Blabbermouth).""This is Skid Row,"" he asserts, expressing support for the band's current lineup,  ""And that conversation is 23 years old.""Currently fronting the band is Swedish singer Erik Grönwall, who joined the group last year and contributed to their new record, The Gang's All Here. He's the fifth frontman the band has had since they split with Bach (Skid Row went on hiatus after firing Bach in 1996 and returned in 1999 without him), but only the second to be featured on new music, the other being the late Johnny Solinger, who died in 2021 and occupied the role from 1999 through 2015.Continuing his thoughts, Sabo goes on, ""And I have no desire to… I'm not interested; none of us are. It comes down to happiness, and we're really, really, really happy where we're at and how the band sounds and feels. I love playing our music, and I love playing it with the guys that we're playing it now with. And so I don't wanna change that. I'm in a great place personally, and I think we're all in a great place as a collective.""In recent years, Skid Row's members have expressed little interest in welcoming Bach back, at least not since an ill-fated attempt to reestablish dialogue between both camps in 2015.Bach, meanwhile, has celebrated his time in Skid Row by embarking on anniversary tours behind the group's first pair of albums — 1989's Skid Row and 1991's Slave to the Grind.Catch Skid Row on their co-headlining tour with Buckcherry this spring from March 9-31 at these dates.

Loudwire;36 Years Ago: Black Sabbath Release Tony Iommi-Led ‘Seventh Star’;It was supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo album.;"It was a giant misstep from its inception all the way until its birth. Black Sabbath’s twelfth studio album, Seventh Star, which came out on Jan. 28, 1986, was never supposed to be a Sabbath record. After bassist Geezer Butler left the band in 1984 following the ""Born Again"" tour, guitarist Tony Iommi decided to write a solo album and then after the dust cleared, put Black Sabbath back together.In fact, Iommi intentionally penned songs that didn’t sound like Black Sabbath in order to expand his horizons. Overall, Seventh Star is a basic, hard rock record with one foot firmly planted in blues rock and the other slipping between the styles of Rainbow and Foreigner. The original plan was to hire an all-star lineup of guest vocalists -- Robert Plant, Rob Halford, David Coverdale and others – but the logistics of tracking down the singers and getting them into the studio proved impossible. So Iommi recruited Jeff Fenholt, whose only claim to fame was playing the lead role in Jesus Christ Superstar. (Coincidentally, Deep Purple’s original vocalist Ian Gillan, who sang on Sabbath’s Born Again, also played the lead role in Jesus Christ Superstar.)Iommi recorded several demos with Fenholt, but producer Jeff Glixman didn’t feel his voice fit the songs and convinced Iommi to let him go and hire another ex-Deep Purple singer, Glenn Hughes. While Iommi and Hughes were working on new songs Fenholt reappeared in an unexpected way; he became a televangelist and did an interview with the New York Times about the evils of rock and roll.“They wrote that he saw the light, rejected evil and all this bollocks,” Iommi wrote in his memoir Iron Man. “We were right back into the Satanism thing because Fenholt was going on about it.”Undaunted, Iommi persevered, contacting Butler to try to get him to play on the record. His wife and manager Gloria agreed that it would be a good move, then the next thing Iommi knew, Geezer had signed on with Ozzy Osbourne to play in his solo group, leaving Iommi as the only original member of Sabbath to play on Seventh Star. The rest of the band consisted of Hughes, bassist Dave Spitz, drummer Eric Singer and keyboardist Geoff Nicholls.While Hughes sounded powerful and versatile on the album, Iommi said working with him wasn’t much fun. “He did ten times more coke than me,” the guitarist wrote. “It just turned into a nightmare. He’d go: ‘I’ve got this idea, I’ve got this idea!’ He drove you up the wall.”Somehow, Iommi and Glixman got through the sessions, which were recorded at Cheshire Sound Studios in Atlanta. In August 1985 they wrapped up the album. The guitarist figured it was a good solo effort and he would do some small-scale touring to support it, then move on to the next project. But Black Sabbath’s manager Don Arden (Sharon Osbourne’s father) and Warner Bros. Records felt Seventh Star should be released as a Black Sabbath album. Not only would it get the band back on the road and in front of fans, it would complete their contract with the label.Since Iommi wanted to point out to fans that this wasn’t a typical Black Sabbath album, Warner Bros. released it as “Black Sabbath Featuring Tony Iommi.” It was hardly the kind of compromise the guitarist was hoping for. “Neither I nor Glenn were pleased with [that] because we felt we weren’t doing the record justice presenting it this way. And to go out and play ‘War Pigs’ and ‘Iron Man’ -- it just wasn’t right.”Black Sabbath, ""No Stranger to Love""Regardless of Iommi’s discontentment, management booked a Black Sabbath tour that featured Glenn Hughes as lead vocalist. Even before the tour began the singer’s drug use caused problems. He had to be dragged onstage for the first show and on another date he had to be wrestled away from drug dealers in order to even make it to the venue. By the third gig, Hughes was suffering from a broken nose, allegedly inflicted by tour manager John Downing when Hughes was being particularly uncooperative. The injury rendered him unable to sing properly and the cocaine he had been aggressively snorting didn’t help his voice any.Realizing the Seventh Star tour -- which featured support acts Anthrax and W.A.S.P. – was burning out fast, Arden suggested that Sabbath cancel the rest of the tour. But Iommi was afraid the band would not just lose money, they’d get sued. So they hired an understudy for Hughes, Ray Gillen and kept him in the wings until the inevitable occurred. After a show in Worcester, Mass. on March 26, Iommi fired Hughes and the band soldiered on with Gillen.The tour didn’t significantly boost record sales, and neither did the video for “No Stranger to Love,” which depicted Iommi alongside Denise Crosby, better known as Tasha Yar in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Seventh Star peaked on the Billboard album chart at No. 78 and quickly dropped.Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;Anders Colsefni Shares Long Statement About 'Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.' Tour, Dedicates it to Joey Jordison + Paul Gray;It's his first big statement since announcing the tour.;"After announcing last week that he'll be playing Slipknot's demo/album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. in full on a brief tour in Australia and New Zealand, the band's former frontman Anders Colsefni has issued a long follow-up statement about the run, which is dedicated to both Joey Jordison and Paul Gray.The 10-track album (11 if you count the noisy hidden track ""Dogfish Rising"") was released on Halloween in 1996, three years before Slipknot released their first official full length on Roadrunner Records. The lineup at the time featured Colsefni, who was replaced by Corey Taylor the following year, as well as percussionist Shawn ""Clown"" Crahan, late drummer and bassist Joey Jordison and Paul Gray, respectively, and guitarists Donnie Steele (lead) and John ""Gnar"" Brainard (rhythm).Colesfni had suggested that this 12-date tour, which will also feature former Mushroomhead vocalist Waylon Reavis performing a co-headlining set of his own, may be the only time he ever plays the record in full live.In a new statement released to Blabbermouth, Colsefni opens up a bit more about the upcoming jaunt.""As many of you are aware, I am not big on social media or talking in the press but with the growing amount of interest in my forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand, I feel it is time to issue a statement,"" the vocalist (who currently fronts Painface) begins, ""My performances as part of this tour are dedicated to my fallen brothers, Joey and Paul. I miss you both dearly. I will be drawing on you both to deliver these songs to our fans with the same level of aggression and volatility that we did together 27 years ago.""Grateful for the positive response to the tour announcement, Colsefni goes on, ""I'd like to acknowledge the vast outpouring of support from my fans all over the world. It has been extremely touching to know how much faith you have had in me for all these years. I will do you all proud.""READ MORE: Who Is Slipknot's New Mystery Member? - 4 Keyboard Players With Ties to the BandHe cautions fans that they shouldn't expect his vocals to sound exactly as they did on that 1996 recordings, noting that time and experience has afford room for professional growth.""I will endeavor to keep the set as authentic to the emotions and sentiments of which they are written,"" the vocalist affirms, ""but I will deliver them as I am now, not the kid I once was. Since these songs were written almost three decades ago, I have had many great opportunities in various bands to hone my vocal abilities, and stagecraft and to grow as a person.""Colsefni even recognized Taylor's support of the tour and that the two have maintained a close relationship since the 1990s.""In response to Corey's well wishes I'd like to say 'Thank you'. It may come as a surprise to many maggots, but it is actually Corey who I have maintained an ongoing friendship since my departure from the band. There has only ever been a kinship between us. I consider Corey a true brother and he has always had my back, and I his,"" Colsefni continues.In conclusion, the singer states, ""Thank you all again for your adoration and support and I look forward to delivering Australasia Mate.

Loudwire;Judas Priest's Rob Halford - I Hate the Sound of My Voice;The Metal God explains why in our new interview.;Did you know Judas Priest’s Rob Halford hates the sound of his own voice? That’s just one tidbit you’ll find in the Metal God’s second book, Biblical. We caught up with Halford to chat about the book, along with over 50 heavy metal years of Priest.Early on into Biblical, Halford describes his discomfort with hearing his own singing voice, and he elaborated to Loudwire in our exclusive new interview. “I don’t think it’s that peculiar,” Halford says. “Because musicians, we’re always trying to reach nirvana… nirvana is unreachable. We’re always, ‘I wish I could have done that bit better or held that scream a bit longer, and that’s part of the joy of what we do.”He continues, “Is it weird? I don’t know, I just can’t stand the sound of my own voice. I listen to it, obviously, in playback when I’m with Andy ‘do it again’ Sneap. I have no choice. I wait for him to say, ‘Got it. Next!’ It’s a peculiar foible, but I learned to live with it. It’s what I do, it’s my life, my life is a metal singer. All that matters to me is what comes out of my mouth when I’m onstage, first and foremost. The biggest struggle for all musicians is when you validate who you are and what you’re about and what you’re achieving with your fans. That’s when it all makes sense. That’s probably the only time I can cope with listening to myself, because I’ve got it coming in at 11 in my ears anyway.”Rob also got candid about his past substance abuse issues, saying in hindsight that he never once had fun while wasted. “Whenever I drank or whenever I drugged, it was to get completely obliterated out of my mind,” Halford explains. “There’s nothing cool or fun or enjoyable about that. I used my drugs and booze to fight against my sexual identity. That was part of my being drawn into that world. It was like a crutch, a mental crutch to what was going on. That was my way of escape, you escape into the oblivion of alcohol and drugs.”“When I look back, that’s my touchstone to whenever the temptation arises… when I’m watching a football game and the beer commercial comes on. It never leaves you, it absolutely never leaves you. It really is one day at a time.”Check out the full interview with Rob Halford below and click here to grab a copy of Biblical, which is available now.Judas Priest's Rob Halford - I Hate the Sound of My VoiceThe Best Metal Songs of Each Year Since 1970See Loudwire's picks for the Best Metal Songs of Each Year Since 1970.;2022-11-01;https://loudwire.com/judas-priest-rob-halford-hate-sound-my-voice-interview/;2022-11-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREJUDASPRIEST'SROBHALFORD-IHATETHESOUNDOFMYVOICE

Loudwire;Zoltan Bathory Explains How Five Finger Death Punch Are Striving to Be More Like Queen;Forget the expectations.;"At nine records in, you might think you have Five Finger Death Punch pegged, but think again! Despite forging a signature sound over the years, guitarist Zoltan Bathory says that things are anything but stale at this stage. In fact, he looks to another band Queen and the trajectory their career took when he views how he feels things will progress with his own band.Speaking to Metal Hammer in their latest issue, the guitarist says of the upcoming Afterlife album, ""This is the ninth record, and at this point everyone knows who we are and the sound. It's very difficult to achieve a signature sound, but when you have that, you have nothing to prove and it allows you to venture farther away. Take Queen: you can't categorize Queen, and that's the place you want to be, because you can do anything.""Further diving into his point, the guitarist offers, ""For us, I think this is the record where that's really starting. For an artist, as much as you want to be free, there's all this expectation, and you set yourself up, like, 'I have all these hit songs so I have to keep repeating that.' That's why I mentioned Queen, because those guys didn't give a shit, they wrote whatever the hell they felt like writing. That's as honest as music can be.""Five Finger Death Punch's lineup also looks a little different, which could factor into an evolving sound. Constants Ivan Moody, Bathory and longtime bassist Chris Kael have been joined by guitarist Andy James and drummer Charlie Engen in recent years.The band's Afterlife album, which has already yielded the title track, ""IOU,"" ""Welcome to the Circus"" and ""Times Like These,"" is almost upon us.

Loudwire;We Answer the Most Searched Questions About Thrash Metal’s ‘Big 4’;Your one-stop shopping for all things Big 4.;"The internet has a lot of questions about thrash metal's Big 4, so we've gone ahead an answered over 10 of the most searched questions.Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax last played together as the Big 4 in 2011, yet the prospect of perhaps one day this will somehow happen again remains one of the biggest and hottest topics in metal. That's probably because just about every interviewer feels the compulsion to ask any of the band's members about it, keeping the conversation alive well over a decade later.For the younger metal fans who are in their teenage years or early 20s right now, it's easy to understand why the dream won't die. These four bands feel mythic, accomplishing things rarely seen again in metal since it's '80s and '90s heyday and it'd be an opportunity for them to capture that essence for just one night where nothing on earth could possibly feel bigger or more important.So, what does the internet want to know? Come find out! First, let's start with the easy one and go deeper from there.Who are the Big 4 of Thrash Metal?Yes, dear metalhead, we just heard your eyes roll. We get it — you love metal, you know the answer. Good for you! Here’s a merit badge for your battle jacket.However, let’s keep in mind that Metallica are a gateway band, meaning they’re the entry point for music fans who aren’t familiar with metal, heard some ‘Tallica, went, “Fuck yeah!,” and decided to seek out more. This newly christened fan keeps seeing the name “Big 4” associated with some things they find out about them and here’s their portal directly to early thrash metal.The Big 4 is a reasonable compass for exploring this subgenre, represented by Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, always in that order (more on that later).Stylistically, they’re all quite different and are celebrated for different reasons, pointing anyone willing to take the leap in different directions of heavy metal’s underground, with some roads leading to punk rock, others extreme metal, and so on.Why are the Big 4 called the Big 4?This is not as obvious as you think! Or is it?It’s self-explanatory what this label represents, but why the word “big?” Why no amusing alliteration? The “Fierce 4” sounds pretty metal, right? (Don’t answer that.) Is it possible it was influenced by the popularization of the Big 8 of accounting firms (now the Big 4)?Or was it just a bunch of media-driven hype with some simple label haphazardly slapped on the four thrash bands with the biggest career album sales, thus a smash marketing and live event success? So successful we’re still talking about it constantly?""I think what [the media] did [when they came up with the 'Big Four'] was they took the four bands who were probably the most successful in the initial period of thrash metal — from, say, '85 or '84 to '90. If you were to go off popularity, if you were going to go off record sales, you would have to say Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer,"" Exodus vocalist Steve 'Zetro' Souza offered up in a 2014 interview with Rock & Pop 95.9 (via Blabbermouth).As the Tootsie Pop turtle and owl say at the end of each commercial, “The world may never know.”What are the best thrash albums not by the Big 4?Well, isn’t this convenient? We actually have a whole list dedicated to just that!To keep in spirit with the bands who populate the Big 4, this list is oriented toward classic thrash metal, so don’t just take our word for gospel.Metal fandom thrives on debating the best bands, albums, guitarists… anything and everything, we will defend our favorites to the death.And if we’re going to pick a hill to die on, it concerns Exodus’ debut record Bonded By Blood. In any theoretical Big 5, Exodus’ name are, 99 times out of 100, the band fans and musicians both mention first. Although Metallica’s Kill ‘Em All, released in 1983, is largely regarded as the first thrash album, many in the scene credit Exodus as the genre’s true originators, back before all these albums started dropping.Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett was even in the band for a brief spell!Exodus, 'Bonded By Blood' (1985)Torrid/Combatloading...In 2013, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine was asked about this Big 5 theoretical by Radio.com (via Metal Insider), to which he replied, “You know, people will say there’s a whole another generation, like the ‘Medium Four’ [laughs], and I think there’s a lot of great bands that fit that bill, too. But I think probably Exodus, because there was nobody else at the time that had that kind of pull or that kind of importance in the metal community. Granted, it was with [late Exodus singer Paul] Baloff, and Baloff had a voice that you had to have an acquired taste for, but you know, I liked him.”The 21st century resurgence of thrash has wrought a crop of incredible new artists as well, which cements the old guard’s status as true gods for birthing this style. We'll touch on those leaders in the new wave further down this page.PLAYLIST: Early Thrash - The '80s & '90sListen/follow here and view the first 100 songs in the playlist below.Why are Anthrax in the Big 4?Whoever occupies the final spot in any top-tier sort of grouping will always come under a bit of fire, many floating theories on which band could have been in the Big 4 instead.Thrash, in it’s earliest state, was largely a San Francisco and Los Angeles thing, with Anthrax and Overkill most notably holding down the entire east coast of the United States. Ever so sadly, our beloved German thrashers are too often an afterthought in the Big 4 conversation, but they’ve got one of their own (again, more on that later).We can point to record sales (estimates of 10 million worldwide) …and that takes care of that!Paul Natkin, Getty ImagesPaul Natkin, Getty Imagesloading...Let’s go deeper though and analyze what bolstered these album sales.First off, Joey Belladonna’s voice (and John Bush’s between 1992 and 2005 and for a brief stint from 2009-2010) have a lot of commercial appeal. Melodic singing just isn’t a common element in thrash, which tends to use a lot more grit and rhythmic cadences. And there was that hugely successful collaboration with Public Enemy (“Bring the Noise”) and a joint tour that exposed both groups to new fan bases.The thrashers made high-profile TV appearances (Married With Children in 1992) and anyone who watched VH1 in the 2000s knows Scott Ian’s face (now devoid of the dyed-red portion of his beard).Anthrax have earned every bit of their spot in the Big 4.Why are Metallica better than Megadeth? / Are Slayer better than Metallica?Whoa, hot potato here! Okay, let’s try not to burn ourselves…Whether Metallica or Megadeth are better than one another is entirely subjective and up to each individual fan’s preferences. What we can answer though is why this is even a question.On April 11, 1983, Metallica fired guitarist Dave Mustaine. He later formed Megadeth and the two's history have been intertwined ever since. Of course, this rivalry (if you want to call it that) has also been fueled through comments in the press throughout the decades. Still, Megadeth are part of the Big 4, so they've done remarkably well compared to, well, just about every other band to ever play this style of metal.Since Metallica are the biggest band in the Big 4 and the single biggest touring band of all time (according to these stats, at least), this kind of success if often perceived as the best. And with a ""rivalry"" one will always ask which of the two is better.The second question here concerning who is better than who is less presumptive and a lot of people want to know if Slayer are better than Metallica. Who doesn't love an underdog argument? There's always someone coming for the crown!One fan on Quora (yes, people still use Quora, believe it or not), was rather diplomatic in their approach to this very question, noting Slayer's influence in the extreme metal underground while contrasting it with Metallica's impact on the mainstream and pop culture.Tim Mosenfelder/WireImageTim Mosenfelder/WireImageloading...What's the ranking of the Big 4 albums?How convenient, we've got that for you right here! Every studio album by Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax ranked from worst to best.Who is the biggest among the Big 4?If you ask Exodus' Zetro (and Rock & Pop 95.9 HM did back in 2014, via Blabbermouth), he's got one of the more interesting and, ultimately, accurate stances.""This is what I say: it's 'The Big One And The Other Three.' Sorry. Neither one of those bands — and I love every single one of them… But Metallica sits on their own. So, to say the 'Big 4'? I don't know if you can say that. You have to say 'The Big One And The Other Three.,'"" he said at the time.Estimates put Metallica's worldwide album sales at over 125 million. Let's just say it's not even close for The Other Three. Every single Metallica studio album (through 2016's Hardwired... To Self-Destruct) has gone platinum, that 2016 effort being the only one not to go at least double platinum in the United States. We've also go nothing but Billboard 200 chart-toppers for each studio effort from 1991's self-titled release (better known as The Black Album) through the current day.We could go on and on, but there's no debate here. Metallica are, simply, the biggest of the bunch.Metallica's James Hetfield performs in 2011.Andre Durao, Getty Imagesloading...What are the other Big 4 of thrash? And the Big 4 of German, Canadian + U.K. thrash?The other Big 4 must be the ""Medium 4"" we quoted Mustaine on above and it's a slippery one. This opens it up to all geographical areas.Exodus' Gary Holt has repeatedly championed Germany's Kreator, Destruction and Sodom, as well as Testament and Overkill.""Testament has every right to be part of the thrash metal legends but it just came down to timing because they came later. And Overkill have been their since the beginning also,"" he told Metal Asylum in 2010, ""But I don’t get hung up on that shit because I know how it all started and I know where I was when the shit got created. We (Exodus) certainly deserve to be part of the founding fathers but you know who often gets excluded are the Germans, Kreator, Destruction and Sodom. Everybody looks to America and forgets those guys. Kreator, Destruction, and Sodom all released records in the early '80s.""The biggest point of contention with the Big 4 is that it is only populated by bands from the United States. There's plenty of other thrash scenes around the globe that have been invaluably influential and, really, everyone just feels bad that only four groups get to share this unique spotlight.Most notably, Germany's Big 4, commonly dubbed Teutonic thrash, is comprised of Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and Tankard. There's some debate about the order, but Kreator certainly claim the No. 1 spot here.Johnny Perilla, LoudwireJohnny Perilla, Loudwireloading...As for Canada, the spotlights don't shine quite as bright, but, rest assured, there's nothing but quality from thrashers in the Great White North. There, many would agree that Voivod, Annihilator, Sacrifice and Razor are tops, with Exciter and Anvil towing the thrash line and Infernal Majesty being a real underground gem.And the U.K.? Ummm, do they have thrash?!...Just kidding! They certainly do, though their scene is not nearly as plentiful. On the earlier end of the timeline, we've got Xentrix, Sabbat, Acid Reign, Lawnmower Deth, Onslaught, Cancer (death/thrash) and, not that you can really count them here, but Venom are worth a mention for the influence they had on thrash and for the way they attacked music on the whole. In the present day, 21st century banner waivers have emerged in Evile, Short Sharp Shock and Savage Messiah.As you can see, there's a significant gap between the U.K. thrash and many other corners of the world.Who are the Big 4 of modern thrash?Unquestionably, Richmond, Virginia's Municipal Waste take the No. 1 spot in this hypothetical hierarchy. Not only are they the premiere 21st century thrash band, they played a massive part in spurring the thrash revival.We're not going to point to extravagant record sales (ever since the CD collapses in the early 2000s it's hard to feel like these figures matter much at all) and simply says that the Waste at the top spot passes the eye test — tour headliners when they want to be, direct support to big name acts, certified classic albums (The Art of Partying and Hazardous Mutations), a unique guitar style and the fans have been going wild for two decades in the pit.As for the remaining three... well, this is starting to feel a lot like ""The Big One and the Other Three"" isn't it? Toxic Holocaust, Warbringer and Evile are three names that are synonymous with the thrash revival of the early 2000s, so that grouping of four feels like a fair spiritual successor to the one true Big 4.However, there's the likes of Power Trip (who appeared to be on the precipice of becoming one of metal's biggest acts of the 2010s before the untimely 2020 passing of vocalist Riley Gale), Enforced, Gama Bomb, Havok, Vulture and Lich King all commanding worthwhile attention right now, too.If you need a heavy dose of 21st Century Thrash, then look no further than Loudwire's Spotify playlist dedicated to just that.Is thrash good?It depends on who you ask, but if you'll allow us to go to bat for thrash...Thrash is heavy, rhythmic music and rhythm is very popular, from groove metal and djent to stuff the mainstream loves such as EDM and drum and bass.It's a stye that, depending on the band you choose to listen to, has a pathway to being accessible. It's not nearly as poppy as the traditional metal as purveyed by Judas Priest and Ozzy, which really just means there's a general lack of radio-friendly choruses and song structures.Metallica are the gateway for a reason and thrash is an ideal middle ground between commercial metal and extreme metal. For those on the outside, it presents a reasonable idea of the heavy in heavy metal without asking too much of a novice listener.So, yeah, thrash is good!Will there be a Big 4 reunion?That's the question you, us and Dave Mustaine want the answer to.Before Slayer's retirement and even years after they hung up their spiked armbands for good, it still seems to all hang on Metallica and how badly, if it all, they want to stir this up again. Obviously, it was a massive success the first time around, but Metallica are not a band that needs any help when it comes to staging success.And one would think that if Metallica (or, in reality Q Prime management) picked up the phone and called the rest of the bands, that it'd be an instant yes from all of them. Slayer would be the tough one, however, but both Kerry King and Gary Holt think the band retired too early, so they'd have to coax Tom Araya out of retirement to get him back onstage and between the plumes of fire that define Slayer's stage show.In late 2022, Megadeth's Mustaine challenged Metallica to ""step up"" and for Slayer to potentially come out of retirement for ""one last round"" before they pass the proverbial torch to tomorrow's Big 4, not just of thrash, but of modern metal entirely. These comments echoed the stance he took in 2018, hoping for at least just one more Big 4 show together.And in 2023 he even rhetorically asked what Metallica are afraid of while floating the idea of doing a joint tour together.Never say never though, right?The 'Big 4' of 17 Metal SubgenresEveryone knows the 'Big 4' of thrash metal, but what about some other styles of metal?The 'Big 4' of 10 Rock + Punk Subgenres";2023-03-27;https://loudwire.com/thrash-metal-big-4-most-searched-questions-answers/;2023-03-28;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWEANSWERTHEMOSTSEARCHEDQUESTIONSABOUTTHRASHMETAL’S‘BIG4’
Loudwire;Alestorm Send Offensive Reply to Palestinian Activist Asking Band to Cancel Tel Aviv Show;'Come and drink rum' was the response when told the fan couldn't attend due to checkpoints and the current occupation.;"Alestorm are set to play Tel Aviv next month, but their appearance does not come without some controversy. As revealed via the Eye on Palestine Instagram account (seen below) and tipped by MetalSucks, the band served up a dismissive response when a Palestinian fan revealed that they wouldn't be able to make the show due to the ongoing occupation of Palestine by Israel.Screenshots of the conversation were shared, with the fan initially asking if the band was coming to perform in Tel Aviv soon and if tickets were available. After being told that the show would be July 5 at Reading Club, the fan explained why they would be unable to attend.""Unfortunately I can't attend because I'm a Palestinian living under Israeli military occupation. We can't access the venue because of Israeli checkpoints everywhere, built illegally on our land,"" stated the fan.The person then suggested that the band's presence would be used to help whitewash the crimes of the occupation and that while a minority will be pleased by the chance to ""hang out,"" many others will be let down as they continue to seek their freedom and justice.At that point, the fan asked the band to consider withdrawing from the event, asking which side of history they wished to be part of.In response, someone from the band's Instagram account messaged back, ""You should come to the show!."" When the fan then reiterated that they were being deprived due to the Israeli checkpoints and apartheid, the band then responded back, ""Come and drink RUM!""While the ""Come and drink rum"" is something you might expect normally from a pirate metal band, the response here fails to take into account the gravity of the messaging from the fan, enough so that it's started making the rounds on social media.""Downplaying the Palestinian suffering is unacceptable,"" reads the post shared by the Eye on Palestine Instagram, adding, ""We urge you to reach out to them and urge them to withdraw immediately.""This would not be the first time a member of the band has faced controversy courtesy of a text exchange. In 2021, Alestorm's Chris Bowes was part of a leaked group chat that included misogynistic and racist banter exchanged with members of the band Gloryhammer.The musician later took responsibility for what was said, explaining, ""Some of us in the band built a private puerile culture for ourselves of always trying to one-up each other by sending progressively more deliberately offensive messages in our chat group, always justifying our incensive [sic] language to ourselves by thinking ""It's fine, we don't actually believe this in real life, it's just a joke.""He went on to stress that this was not at all a joke and committed himself to working with ""professionals"" to better understand the damage he has caused through use of his undeniably offensive language.";2022-06-13;https://loudwire.com/alestorm-offensive-reply-palestinian-activist-cancel-tel-aviv-show/;2022-06-16;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREALESTORMSENDOFFENSIVEREPLYTOPALESTINIANACTIVISTASKINGBANDTOCANCELTELAVIVSHOW
Loudwire;James Hetfield Calls Woman Who Gave Birth at Metallica Show;Just wait until this baby is old enough to hear all these stories!;"On May 7, Joice M. Figueiró gave birth to a baby boy during a Metallica concert in Brazil and, after learning of this news, James Hetfield gave her a phone call to congratulate her.The moment was shared on Figueiró's Instagram story, which was captured and uploaded as a YouTube video and can be seen further down the page. In the brief clip, the parents of newborn Luan are seen seated around a table, both wearing Metallica apparel while in a state of disbelief that the frontman of Metallica is on the line to speak with them.Figueiró sat with one hand over her face, unsure of what to say back but obviously overwhelmed and appreciative of such a unique moment. ""I'm crying,"" she said after Hetfield congratulated her and her husband.During Metallica's set on May 7, Figueiró, who was 39 weeks pregnant at the time, was tended to by medical personnel with intentions on transporting her to a local hospital, but with the arrival of the baby becoming increasingly imminent, she delivered Luan on-site right as the metal legends closed out the night with the classic ""Enter Sandman.""Tonight (May 12), Metallica will play the final show on their South American run in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and, later this month, they'll appear at the BottleRock and Boston Calling festivals with a European festival circuit on the books for the summer, followed by two select U.S. shows in August.

Loudwire;'Pam & Tommy' Series Includes Dialogue Between Lee and His Penis;See who will be playing the role of 'Tommy Lee's Penis.';"As much discussion as Tommy Lee's penis generated after his sex tape with Pamela Anderson went public in the '90s, you'd think it was its own character. Well, as it turns out, in the upcoming Pam & Tommy series documenting the story of the stolen sex tape, Lee's penis does have dialogue.In a feature article with Variety done about the upcoming Hulu series, it's revealed that the Motley Crue rocker's penis does come with a voice and will share dialogue with Lee upon first meeting and falling in love with Pamela Anderson. The penis will be voiced by actor Jason Mantzoukas, best known for his roles on FX's The League (where his character Rafi was a frequent guest opposite Pam & Tommy actor Seth Rogen's Dirty Randy), NBC's The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.According to the article, Lee's penis pops up in Episode 2 to have a discussion with the musician after he just met the Baywatch actress. But as is revealed, the creators of the series weren't taking creative license, as the so-called discussion was actually detailed in Lee's book, ""Tommyland.""“As much as I’d like to take credit for that, I was simply adapting a chapter from [Lee’s] memoir,” says scriptwriter Robert Siegel. “I think it might be a first [for television]. There was gentle pushback, because you’ve got to push back a little when a talking penis is presented to you. But Hulu was extremely supportive.”So how exactly did they pull off this one-on-one discussion? Director and executive producer Craig Gillespie told Variety that shooting the scene was ""just awkward,"" explaining, ""You’ve got four puppeteers working with an animatronic penis. And then, how much is too much, and do you start to lose his emotional torment of what’s going on? Hopefully it works.”Sebastian Stan, the actor portraying Tommy Lee, said of the scene that he approached it just like interacting with any other scene partner. “By the end of it, I treated it like it was an intimate buddy conversation that one might have when they’re falling in love,” he explained.The Pam & Tommy series kicks off Feb. 2 on Hulu.25 Actors Who Transformed Into Real Life Rock Stars for Movies";2022-01-19;https://loudwire.com/pam-tommy-series-dialogue-between-tommy-lee-penis/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE'PAM&TOMMY'SERIESINCLUDESDIALOGUEBETWEENLEEANDHISPENIS

Paramore are scheduled to return to the road later this year and into next.However, Oregon and Salt Lake will have to wait a little while longer for their next Paramore shows, judging by what Williams explained in an Instagram Story early on Thursday morning.""Hey everybody, we just got off stage in seattle,"" the Paramore singer writes. ""After speaking with our team and my doc, I know that trying to finish this tour is now going to come at a detriment to my health. My lungs are just not healing quickly enough to keep up. It got a little scary tonight.""She continues, ""We will have the team post an official statement ASAP but we are going to have to cancel the last 2 shows of the tour so I can get better, finally. I know some of you are camping in Portland already so I just wanted to get this out there.""Williams adds, ""I'm so sorry for all the chaos this has caused some of you. I really tried to kick this shit. Love you all.""As promised, Paramore followed the singer's update with an official statement reiterating the same sentiment later on Thursday. ""I'm now risking long term damage and I need to pay attention to my body,"" Williams said in the official statement. See it in full below. Refunds for the canceled Paramore shows will be available at point of purchase.Please subscribe to Loudwire's newsletter and download the Loudwire app to stay up to date with all of the latest rock and metal news.Hayley Williams' MessageHayley Williams Instagram StoryInstagram: @yelyahwilliamsloading...Paramore MessageParamore 2023 Tour DatesOct. 6, 2023 – New York, N.Y. @ New Yorker FestNov. 18, 2023 – Aukland, New Zealand @ SparkNov. 22, 2023 – Brisbane, Australia @ Ent.

Loudwire;Judas Priest's Glenn Tipton Breaks Silence on K.K. Downing's Accusations;'It’s just that his accusations have gotten sillier and sillier – and I deserve to respond,' said Tipton.;"In a new interview with Guitar World, Judas Priest's Glenn Tipton has responded to many of the public accusations levied by disgruntled former bandmate K.K. Downing over the last decade following his 2011 departure from the legendary metal band.In the press and in his 2018 biography, Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest, Downing has aired his grievances with the group as well as management and took particular aim at Tipton, both personally and professionally. Downing had asserted that his creative role in Judas Priest was consistently undermined or unheralded and that he was responsible for devising the band's iconic studded leather imagery, among other things.""I never wanted to get into a public argument after K.K. left,"" began Tipton. ""I never said a word, and I stuck to my guns for over 10 years, but there comes a point when you read things that have been said that are just crazy. It's time to say something, really because he's saying things that he really shouldn't be saying. They aren't fair.""The guitarist, who stepped back from his full-time live role in Judas Priest in 2018 due to complications from Parkinson's Disease, went on, ""He's insinuated that he was the driving force of the band. It just isn't true. Priest [is] made up of five guys working together. [There's] not just one person driving the band. He's said all these things that, I think, are meant to upset us and get us to say something in response and for a long time we didn't. But I've got a lot to say and enough's enough.""In his book and in an interview with Guitar World last year, Downing alleged that Judas Priest's live performances were inhibited by Tipton's onstage drinking habits, to which Tipton replied, ""Everyone knows it's not true. Like I said, the fans aren't stupid and they've seen me for 50 years playing around the world. I may have had a couple of beers onstage, but that's all. It's never affected the concert or my performance whatsoever and he knows that.""Tipton later suggested that Downing's work in the studio was not up to par and that he ""used to piece [Downing's] leads together."" ""I did a lot of editing to make his lead breaks worthwhile,"" Tipton revealed.Reiterating his reluctance to touch on the things Downing has said about him and the band over the last decade, the veteran Priest guitarist added, ""I would never have talked about Ken that way. It’s just that his accusations have gotten sillier and sillier – and I deserve to respond. He left the band. We couldn’t convince him to stay. And then he accused me of taking six years off to write two solo albums. I only did the solo albums because we were inactive at the time while Rob was doing his solo things.""Meanwhile, Richie Faulkner, who replaced Downing after he retired from Judas Priest, recently expressed that he wishes both sides could put away the bitterness of the last 10 years. ""To me, music aside, they should maybe pick up the phone and just talk to each other as buddies and go and have a beer and just be pals. You know, fuck music for a minute; let's just be pals. And then whatever happens, happens,"" he said.The Most Underrated Song on Every Judas Priest AlbumDeep cuts, hidden gems... whatever you want to call them!";2022-02-22;https://loudwire.com/judas-priest-glenn-tipton-responds-kk-downing-accusations/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREJUDASPRIEST'SGLENNTIPTONBREAKSSILENCEONK.K.DOWNING'SACCUSATIONS
Loudwire;Signed Guitar Kurt Cobain Smashed Onstage Can Be Yours for the Right Price;Own a piece of history.;"Kurt Cobain wasn't known for treating instruments nicely during Nirvana shows, but his fans now have the unique opportunity to bid on and own one of the guitars he smashed onstage.Julien's Auctions has announced an event called Icons & Idols: Rock 'N' Roll, which will take place Friday, Nov. 11 and Saturday, Nov. 12 both at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York and online. Pieces owned by music legends including Cobain, Eddie Van Halen, Gene Simmons, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Nikki Sixx and others will be part of the auction event.The Cobain-owned guitar is a 1973 Fender Mustang that the singer played and destroyed onstage during two shows in 1989, one in Chicago, Ill. at Club Dreamerz and the other in Wilkinsburg, Pa. at the Sonic Temple venue. These shows were part of the band's very first U.S. tour, which kicked off shortly after the release of their debut album Bleach. Cobain ended up trading the guitar for a smashed Gibson SG owned by Sluggo Cawley of the band Hullabaloo, and on the Mustang he wrote, ""Yo Sluggo / Thank for the trade / If its illegal to Rock and Roll, then throw my ass in jail / Nirvana.”See some images of the guitar below.The guitar currently has four bids, with the current bid being $200,000. There's a whole collection of items related to Nirvana that'll be included in the auction as well, including signed albums and articles of clothing, all-access passes,Those interested in bidding on Cobain's guitar or any of the other items at the auction must register beforehand, either online or in person at the event.

Loudwire;23 Years Ago: Metallica Go Symphonic With 'S&M' Release;Metallica stepping way outside their comfort zone.;"To some, it seemed like Metallica were running out of ideas. After 1997’s Reload – which was actually the completion of a session they began for 1996’s Load), the band released the double-album of covers, Garage Inc., and on Nov. 23, 1999, they put out S&M, a two-disc career-spanning live collaboration between Metallica and conductor Michael Kamen’s San Francisco Symphony.For anyone who’s examined Metallica’s history it was really just another example of the band expanding its horizons and trying something out because they just fuckin’ wanted to. It’s a path Metallica have taken throughout their career, whether pioneering a new musical style on 1983’s Kill ‘Em All, abandoning their thrash core and writing a straight-ahead metal record on 1991’s Metallica, experimenting with cut-and-paste production, low-fi engineering and angular writing for 2003’s St. Anger or joining forces with Lou Reed for the improvisational 2011 concept album Lulu.Sometimes the diversions have been triumphs, occasionally they’ve been failures, but each step Metallica has taken has been crucial in their evolution. Without the freedom to screw up, the band wouldn’t have enjoyed its success.S&M, which stands for Symphony and Metallica, wasn’t a groundbreaking achievement, but it was a cool experiment that yielded an enjoyable album. The album features at least one selection from every studio record except Kill ‘Em All, as well as the two new songs, “No Leaf Clover” and “Human,” and Kamen wrote a complementary orchestral score for over 100 classical musicians.Metallica With Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, ""No Leaf Clover""Kamen discovered Metallica in 1991 when he worked with producer Bob Rock on parts for an acoustic remix of “Nothing Else Matters,” which was the B-side of the “Sad But True” single. Intrigued by the possibilities of a true collaboration, Kamen asked Metallica if they would be interested in playing a set of their songs along with his orchestra.The band agreed and provided Kamen a list of the songs they wanted to perform. Kamen crafted a cinematic soundtrack to the songs that augmented and enhanced the music with whirling violin and flutes passages between riffs, and martial horn and string parts to accompany some of Metallica’s heaviest and most well-known rhythms. The band and orchestra debuted the compositions at two concerts at The Berkeley Community Theatre, April 21 and 22, 1999. Both shows were recorded and Rock edited the best takes into the S&M album. “S&M was Michael's idea, Michael's brainchild. He said he had always felt that our music lent itself to collaboration with an orchestra,” said Metallica.Metallica With Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, ""Human""Often, live albums featuring orchestras are greeted with indifference by fans; not S&M. Buoyed by glowing reviews, the set sold swiftly and abundantly, shifting 300,000 copies in its first week and debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart. By Jan. 14, 2000, S&M was certified quadruple platinum, according to the RIAA. On June 9, 2003 S&M was quintuple platinum.Metallica also released a video and DVD version of the concerts, filmed by director Wayne Isham. The film sold over 600,000 copies in the U.S. and was certified sextuple platinum. While Metallica thoroughly enjoyed working with Kamen and the attention it brought them, S&M was a one-off project rather than some sort of sonic epiphany.“From the time he approached us with the idea at that first breakfast meeting in 1997, to the day after the final mixes were complete on the record and the DVD, through the performances in Berlin, New York, and Las Vegas, we enjoyed two extremely fun, challenging, and creative years together,” said Metallica in a statement after Kamen died of multiple sclerosis in 2003. Metallica have not worked with an orchestra since S&M, though drummer Lars Ulrich doesn’t rule it out.“The thing about Metallica is you never know what we’re going to do,” he told me in 2012. “We might work with an orchestra again, we might get a call from someone we’ve never worked with before who we like and who wants to work with us, and suddenly we’ll do an album together.”Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;David Draiman Shares Thoughts On ‘Bigots’ Upset By A Black Ariel In New 'Little Mermaid' Movie ;The Disturbed singer speaks out against the trolls.;"If you follow Disturbed frontman David Draiman on social media, you know he has a lot of thoughts on politics, society, music and other hot topics. His latest is addressing the ""bigots"" that have stirred up some unnecessary controversy over Disney casting a Black actress to play the lead role of Ariel in a live-action take on the classic animated film, The Little Mermaid.On Friday, September 16, the singer posted on his personal Twitter account, ""If you have a problem with someone dark skinned playing the role of a fantasy creature like Ariel the mermaid, you’re not really worried about 'keeping true to the original story,' you’re just being a bigot.""Draiman was directly referring to those who have made veiled statements since Disney announced in 2019 that actress and singer Halle Bailey (half of sibling pop duo Chloe x Halle) would be in the lead role, saying that the choice is not in line with the original depiction of the animated character who was seen as a white, red-haired woman.The conversation took on a life of its own again last week when Disney released the trailer for the film, slated for a theatrical debut in May 2023. Blabbermouth reports that there was so much backlash on the YouTube video page that the beloved brand took the step of disabling the option to dislike it.Bailey has been focusing on the positive reactions to her casting in the movie, sharing a reel of reaction videos to her Twitter account on September 12 of young Black girls who have been delighting in seeing her in the starring role. As she shared with Hollywood Reporter, ""The fact that I get to represent all of these little young black and brown boys and girls who are to come is really special to me because I know that if I had that when I was younger, it would have changed my whole perspective on life.""Other celebrities and personalities have spoken out about the backlash again this week, including Trevor Noah who addressed it in a piece for ""The Daily Show."" CNN Reporter Lisa France also weighed in while CNN posted a ""rebuttal to every racist Little Mermaid comment.""Draiman's posting on the matter comes at a time he continues to be vocal about socio-political matters, after a period when he was so disheartened by social media (calling it a ""playground for trolls"") that he deleted his account back in 2015. But there's also music moments he shares too, like a retweet today celebrating the 20th anniversary of Disturbed's second album, Believe.How 15 Nu-Metal Musicians Felt About Being Called 'Nu Metal'They should own it.";2022-09-17;https://loudwire.com/david-draiman-black-ariel-little-mermaid/;2022-09-18;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREDAVIDDRAIMANSHARESTHOUGHTSON‘BIGOTS’UPSETBYABLACKARIELINNEW'LITTLEMERMAID'MOVIE

Loudwire;Oli Herbert's Widow Denies Killing Guitarist in First Interview Since His Death;She also shares what she thinks may have happened.;"The death of All That Remains guitarist Oli Herbert surprised many in 2018, and nearly four years later the case has not been closed. Not long after the death, the toxicology report stated that the musician had drowned, but police were treating the death as ""suspicious."" Now, in her first interview since Herbert's death, the musician's wife Beth has stated publicly, ""‘I absolutely did not kill my husband.""'Everybody’s telling me to shut up, but all shutting up has done is let this stuff solidify as truth, and it’s not,"" said Beth in speaking with The Daily Mail.Herbert's body was discovered on Oct. 16 in a pond near where he lived with his wife.  In the aftermath of the guitarist's death, Beth found herself under suspicion from both police and those who had been close to the musician. Herbert had notarized his will a week prior at a car dealership that would leave everything to Beth, also stating that his sister Cynthia would receive nothing. Beth explained that the timing of the will change was coincidental, noting that they'd recently had a friend who passed and that led the musician to make the decision to prepare for the unexpected.""We loved each other, we trusted each other and we were husband and wife, despite everyone else doing whatever they could to break us up,"" she stated, adding, ""We were leaving each other everything, including making each other beneficiaries of each other's life insurance policies.""Within the interview, the guitarist's widow states that she's been targeted since Oli's death with police trying to ""railroad"" her into a confession. She adds that her religious beliefs were even used against her, claiming, ‘The police department tried to get an arrest warrant based on witchcraft, saying I was casting black spells on him and slipping him drugs.""As for the night of Herbert's death, Beth recalls that the guitarist had been feeling sick that day. They had stood in the yard together, and she says, ""He was out of it. I had to lead him back to the house several times that evening."" Beth says they went inside around 9PM, adding, ‘I asked him if he wanted to go to bed and he said, ""No, I just want to sit here and listen to the wind blowing through the trees,"" The last thing he said before I went up to bed was, 'Thank you, I love you.""’Later that night, she was woken by some bumping that occurred downstairs, and when she got up the next morning, he wasn't there. He was reported missing in the afternoon, and later discovered in the water just shortly down from the house.Within the investigation of Herbert's death, it was revealed that in July 2018 the musician had made a complaint that a woman in the area near the pond had pushed him into the water.Beth told The Daily Mail that they had been involved in a strange account with a woman named Penelope who had showed up one night as the couple were searching for one of their dogs near the pond. Though neither Beth nor Oli claimed to have known her, they accepted her help to search for the animals. But according to Beth, at one point Penelope pushed Oli into the water and then ran off. They reported the incident to the police, but the mystery woman was never seen again""They (police) thought maybe she had something to do with his death, but they can’t find her,"" says Beth, who later added, ""Police accused me of being Penelope and pushing him. But I was like – how can I split myself in two?""Beth also goes into detail about the relationship with a Hartford auto dealership employee Wendy Skrivner, who notarized the will that Herbert had signed about a week before his death.Becth claimed that Wendy had slept with her husband, then got so upset when he broke it off that she called to apologize to Beth and they then started to have a friendship. But as the police investigation into Herbert's death continued, the two had a falling out. Wendy told The Daily Mail that she had never slept with Herbert, and denied flirting with the musician as Beth had suggested in her interview.When the subject of Oli's death came up, Beth stated, ""I absolutely did not kill my husband.""She went on to elaborate on the investigation, stating, ‘The police, they were talking to all these people who had an axe to grind with me. People are accusing me for various reasons, for revenge, for free publicity, to try to build careers for themselves."" She also called out lead detective, Michael Zeila, adding, ‘You could tell he was fan of the band. Here he is, this country cop, and he’s working on a rock star who died. I think he got star struck and was on a power trip.""When asked if she had any theories on how her husband died, Beth stated that she had no idea. She suggested Ambien as one possibility. She also circled back to Penelope as an option.""That did cross my mind when the police found my husband’s body – that it was Penelope. Did Penelope come back? Did he stumble down there on his own? We don’t know. All I know is I was upstairs in bed and when I came downstairs in the morning he wasn’t in the house.""In the time since Herbert's death, All That Remains released Victim of the New Disease, their final album with the musician that had been completed just before his death. Jason Richardson initially subbed in to help with touring for the record, then eventually signed on permanently to handle lead guitar duties.Now nearly four years removed from Herbert's death, Beth said she intends on moving away from the home where her husband passed.

Loudwire;10 Killer New Age Bands Playing Classic Heavy Metal;Arthur Rizk, producer and guitarist for Sumerlands and Eternal Champion, defends true steel with his picks.;"Arthur Rizk is not only one of the hottest producers in metal right now, he's also the guitarist in New Wave of Traditional Heavy Metal faithfuls Sumerlands and Eternal Champion. And he's here to share in the glory by schooling you in 10 Killer New Age Bands Playing Classic Heavy Metal. Around the time I was 8 years old, I was exposed to heavy metal and hard rock via my older cousins from Lebanon. When I learned to play guitar, the first things I learned were Iron Maiden, Scorpions and Metallica and that is the path I’ve stayed on. I’ve been obsessed with a variety of different music since then, but my love for what you would call “classic metal” is eternal.I’ve picked out 10 bands (all of which are currently active) who play classic metal in the modern day, which is sometimes categorized as NWOTHM (New Wave of Traditional Heavy Metal). I prefer to just say “heavy metal” because in 100 years, these bands may be considered just the “heavy metal” era alongside Judas Priest and Black Sabbath. After all, Mozart and Beethoven existed over 30 years apart from each other but are considered to be from the same period and they get labeled the same!Since I am also a producer who works in this genre, I left all the bands I have worked with off of the list out of respect for journalistic integrity and to avoid conflict of interest. I also tried to avoid a lot of obvious bands and highlighted a few that do not have a lot of worldwide recognition.The NWOTHM playlist Loudwire put together NWOTHM is a killer assortment of current shit from our era and features some I have worked with. It also includes the new Sumerlands single, ""Dreamkiller.” Wink, wink!Okay! Without droning on any further, and in no particular order, here is my list of 10 Killer New Age Bands Playing Classic Heavy Metal!Thanks to Arthur Rizk for answering the call to defend true steel. Get your copy of Sumerlands' 'Dreamkiller' album here (out now on Relapse) and follow the band on Instagram, Facebook, Bandcamp and Spotify. And blast Sumerlands' ""Dreamkiller"" below while checking out Rizk's picks.Sumerlands, ""Dreamkiller""Head here to listen to Loudwire's NWOTHM (New Wave of Traditional Heavy Metal) playlist.Killer Band: Mirror (Cyprus)  Killer Release: ‘The Day The Bastard Leaders Die’ (Cruz Del Sur, 2022)I saw Mirror play in an abandoned amusement park in Sweden this year at Muskelrock, and it was totally inspiring. After watching a million bands a year you eventually get desensitized and I was on a break from metal in general.Mirror made me immediately pick up my guitar to start writing and set my heavy metal spirit ablaze. Jimmy Mavrommatis’ voice, memorable choruses, tasteful solos/leads and the influence of the Mediterranean in their genetic makeup had me zooted.A crude combo of bands I would compare them to would be early Iron Maiden, Mercyful Fate and Warlord. Hail Cyprus! These guys also fed the whole audience booze they brought from Cyprus.Killer Band: Arch / Matheos (Connecticut)Killer Release: ‘Winter Ethereal’ (Metal Blade, 2019)Fates Warning wrote, IMHO, the greatest prog/power metal LP — Awaken The Guardian. Some members from that album started a new band in the 2010s and I was utterly shocked when I first heard it — a high end example of how a record from 2019 transcends music from 1986, but exists in a modern hybrid context. This record should be called “Sit down children, don’t quit your day job.” A bit of a cross between Rush, Crimson Glory and Cynic… Pure perfection. Thank you Arch / Matheos!Killer Band: Black Sword Thunder Attack (Greece)Killer Release: ‘March of the Damned’ (No Remorse Records, 2020)Black Sword Thunder Attack were the eighth wonder of the world to me when I heard the 2011 cult demo In Hell’s Reign and remained so until a few years when I first visited Greece. I met their bassist Stelios at a now sadly closed venue in Athens called The Crow Club. It was a sick place with movie memorabilia everywhere and a lot from the movie The Crow — R.I.P.I later learned they recruited a new singer (Mareike) and were about to release their first official EP with her. This release totally rocked me! The melancholic synth work is flawless Mediterranean dark pop composition, fused with the cold epic vocals of Mareike. I would crudely describe it as somewhere between Manilla Road/Lordian Guard but way more obscure sounding.Killer Band: Lords Of Triumph (Denmark/ USA [Parts Unknown])Killer Release: ‘Lost Times’ (Self Released, 2022)Phil Swanson (Vestal Claret, Solemn Lament, Smith & Swanson, ex-Sumerlands) is one of my favorite songwriters/vocalists of all time — it’s no secret. This band is a collaboration between Phil and another incredible songwriter Martin Sparvath of (another killer band) Altar Of Oblivion.I am a huge fan of the unassuming epicness of the choirs, the non-traditional choppy drum beats, the general doomed out song writing and the ultra-refined guitar leads. The new EP Lost Times has been on repeat and it’s so sick to hear some current obscure heavy metal with great hooks, both vocally and on guitar.Killer Band: Claymorean (Serbia)Killer Release: ‘Sounds From a Dying World’ (Stormspell, 2017)Claymorean are a recent discovery of mine, going back to the release of their Eulogy for the Gods album in 2021. The vocal lines, sung in English with a Serbian accent, are total earworms that hooked me on my first listen.I’m often reminded of later Judas Priest and they can be described as a cross between Manowar, Hammerfall and Dark Star. Much respect for prevailing in such a small scene!Killer Band: Terminus (Ireland)Killer Release: ‘A Single Point Of Light’ (Cruz Del Sur, 2019)My blood brother and singer of Eternal Champion, Jason Tarpey, put me onto Terminus. I loved their 2017 record The Reaper’s Spiral, but the newest record captivated me right away. From the first moment, it came in with the ferocity of a death-thrash record, but with power metal vocals. It’s like a mashup of Manilla Road, Twisted Tower Dire and Manowar on the heavier moments.Killer Band: Blood Star (Utah)Killer Release: ‘The Fear’ (Shadow Kingdom, 2020)Blood Star share members with Salt Lake City’s Visigoth, and once I heard that I wasted no time checking them out. The 7” titled “The Fear” is fucking amazing and starts with my favorite kind of heavy metal guitar playing — a fusion of melancholy and power metal.The vocals are insanely catchy — total earworm city. I can’t help feeling like Madeline’s vocals are slightly country inspired or maybe it is the Utah accent? Maybe it’s Blood Star’s cover of The Highwaymen’s “Silver Stallion” that makes me feel that way. I highly suggest jamming the song below — I have listened to it so many times.Killer Band: Wrathblade (Greece)Killer Release: ‘Into The Netherworld’s Realm’ (Eat Metal, 2012)I mentioned meeting Black Sword Thunder Attack in Greece at The Crow Club, but what I didn’t mention is we (Eternal Champion) were playing with the legendary band Wrathblade that night. I was already a fan, but that night I became a diehard and went home and jammed this record for a month straight. It again relit my heavy metal flame at a time where I was mostly listening to Bee Gees, Abba and Barbara Streisand. Perfect production — raw, heavy and in your face. A cross between Omen, Iron Maiden and Doomsword.Killer Band: Demon Bitch (Michigan)Killer Release: ‘Hellfriends’ (Skol, 2016)Demon Bitch appeared on Fenriz from Darkthrone’s 2016 end of the year list along with Sumerlands and Eternal Champion.Just three seconds into Hellfriends I thought it was perfectly mixed and at exactly 11 seconds in there was a skip kick drum beat that hit so hard. Logon’s vocals kicked in not too far after and I could not believe what I was hearing — he has the power of Geoff Tate circa Queensryche’s self-titled EP, not that there was any evidence of that inspiration.The guitar solos fly in and out so quickly that you don’t know what hit you. I was and still am addicted to the record — it is like crack and I am taking a break from writing this article to finish listening to Hellfriends right now.A cross of Jag Panzer, Agent Steel and early Queensrÿche. Hail MichiganKiller Band: Graven Rite (Texas)Killer Release: ‘The Summoner’s Pit’ (Parallel Resonance, 2012) This band preceded Eternal Champion and was a massive inspiration that lit a fire under my ass. I had been writing demos with the intent to start a band with their singer, Jason Tarpey, and when I heard the finished product that is this Texas metal classic, I just knew I had to work harder to make it worth his time. This record is flawless.A cross between Manilla Road and Cirith Ungol with some atmospheric elements of Queensrÿche. Hard as fuck above all else and, again, total legends.Honorable MentionsThere is a massive scene right now and I wish I could’ve made this list 50 bands long.

Loudwire;Charlie Benante Names 'The Best Thrash Record' Ever and It's Not What You Might Think;What could it be?!;Considering that the ‘Big 4’ of thrash metal are Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer, you’d probably say that one of them created the subgenre’s greatest record, right? Well, Anthrax’s Charlie Benante would disagree, as he feels that the “demo tape” of a certain Californian band reigns supreme.The famed drummer recently spoke with Bravewords about the upcoming second leg of Anthrax’s 40th anniversary North American tour (during which they’ll be supported by Black Label Society and Exodus). When asked why the latter group replaced Hatebreed – who opened for Anthrax last summer – Benante explained that Hatebreed “couldn’t make it” and that Anthrax has “taken [Exodus] out a lot through the years.”Perhaps a major reason why they’ve played with Exodus so much is that – according to Benante – Exodus made the best thrash record of all time. Specifically, he stated:The first time I heard Exodus was their demo tape. Actually, a friend of mine gave it to me. Then, another friend of mine was doing a record label, Torrid Records, and they were going to put out the first Exodus record. That’s when I heard what the record was sounding like. To this day, I say the same thing – that first Exodus record, to me, is the best thrash record that’s ever come out. I always put that #1.Obviously, he’s talking about their 1985 debut LP, Bonded by Blood (which Loudwire ranked at #2 on our list of the 10 Best Thrash Albums Not Released by the Big 4). That said, he does mention their “demo tape,” too, so he may've also been impressed by one of Exodus’ unofficial collections from 1982 or 1983. In any case, it’s interesting that he places it above something from the ‘Big 4.’It's also worth mentioning that near the end of the interview, Benante clarifies that there are “no plans” to film any of the upcoming shows with Black Label Society and Exodus.So, what do you think of his pick for the greatest thrash LP ever? Are you planning to catch the trio of bands on tour later this month or sometime in February?

Loudwire;Wolfgang Van Halen Has a Different Reverence for 'Frankenstein' Guitar Than His Father;'Picking up that guitar is almost a religious experience,' says Wolfgang.;"Eddie Van Halen's ""Frankenstein"" guitar is one of the most iconic instruments in the history of rock, one that is held in reverence by most Van Halen fans, including his son, but in a new Total Guitar interview, Wolfgang shares a humorous story about how his father's view on the instrument differed from his.Wolfgang recalled, “It’s funny, when I started recording with it back in 2015, we pulled it out and Dad picked it up, played it for a second and then sorta just tossed it on the couch. Everybody in the room gasped! Because to us, it’s quite literally the most famous guitar in the existence of music, where to him it was this little piece of junk he put together. So that divide in opinion over it was funny to see!”The ""Frankenstrat"" guitar was created by Eddie Van Halen in his attempt to combine the sound of a classic Gibson guitar with the physical attributes of a Fender Stratocaster. A copy of the Frankenstrat has been housed in the National Museum of American History.As for playing the guitar that his father famously played, the musician says, ""You can feel the history sort of emanating out of the Frankenstein. Picking up that guitar is almost a religious experience, even if you’re not a religious person. You just kinda hold it and feel the history right there in your hands.""While many might not dream of changing a thing on the instrument, that wasn't the case for Eddie, with Wolfgang explaining, “He was constantly tinkering with it – that’s why it was called the Frankenstein! He was never satisfied.”READ MORE: The 16 Most Expensive Guitars of All-TimeWill Wolfgang Van Halen Use Frankenstein Guitar on Next Mammoth WVH Album?Wolfgang played the legendary Frankenstein guitar on his last album, with the guitar being used on the songs ""Mammoth"" and ""Feel,"" and it is tentatively set to be used on Wolfgang's next Mammoth WVH album as well.""The only thing I have left to do is track the guitar solos, so what I want to do is go through some of Pop’s notable guitars and do a solo with each of them. Guitars like the Frankenstein or the Shark, stuff like that,” said Van Halen.As for that next record, Van Halen also offered Total Guitar an update on the scope of the album. “On the debut there was this width of what the project was – on the left you had songs like 'Distance' and 'Circles,' those softer vibes, and on the right you had tracks like 'Stone' and 'The Big Picture.' In the middle, there were songs like 'Mammoth' or 'Epiphany' and stuff like that. What I want to do with this album is widen what that breadth is,"" he explained.“Further left, for example, there’s a song that’s all on piano... so it has more of a softer vibe. But on the right, there’s some really heavy sh*t in comparison to the debut! That’s what I find really exciting, it’s fun to stretch the definition of Mammoth on both sides.”Will Wolfgang Van Halen Play All the Instruments on His Next Album?On his Mammoth WVH debut, Wolfgang played lead and rhythm guitar, bass, drums, piano and sang, and even though he fielded a touring band to support the record, he's back tackling the majority of the instruments on the second Mammoth WVH record as well.Some people try to turn me playing everything into a negative thing, which surprises me,"" he stated. ""It’s like they think I won’t let other people play on it or something like that. But really this is what Mammoth is and always has been – it’s my artistic expression.""“I’ve been in bands before where you collaborate and that’s not what this is,"" he continues.""I have a live band but in the studio I do everything and have a fun time doing it. I enjoy being able to express myself musically in every avenue.”An official release date and album details have yet to be revealed, but Wolfgang and his Mammoth WVH touring band are back out on the road this spring.

Loudwire;Concern Over Sexist Comments Is Why Paramore’s Hayley Williams Doesn’t ‘Dare’ Play Guitar Live;She shares her concerns with the members of Wet Leg.;"Paramore's Hayley Williams plays the guitar, though it's not something you often see her do live. During a recent chat with the members of Wet Leg on The Face podcast, she revealed why she's been reluctant to play guitar live, chalking it up to the commentary, some of it sexist, that would eventually result online.Williams joined Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers for a chat, when the discussion turned to being female musicians in guitar-led music.Teasdale offered, “I think for us one of the hardest or most irritating things about being women is probably just the stupid comments on the internet like, ‘Oh she’s holding that guitar but she’s not actually playing it.' Like, for example, when I am just not using my guitar but then I need to play it in the chorus or something, there will always be a comment being like, ‘Girls shouldn’t play guitar, women shouldn’t play guitar,’ and it’s just like… it’s so dated but it’s still there! And I just hate it so much. It’s so frustrating.”Williams then chimed in, “I know those people so well, and I don’t even play guitar onstage. I don’t even dare, because I love to play guitar but I don’t know if I could handle… man. I feel you so hard.""“I just hate that people even need to point it out,” she continued. “I don’t even really think about my gender at all, when we play the music especially. It’s just not part of the picture. I’m trying to lean into femininity and empower that part of myself more in this era of my career, but do you ever get on stage and feel ‘other’? You feel like this alien thing that’s powerful and beautiful.”Later in the discussion, Williams admitted her own insecurity playing guitar in front of others. She recalled, ""When I made the second solo record, just kind of by myself, and I had a friend engineer it for me, I played all that stuff and I felt so free to do it cause no one was watching. I was just at home and felt really creative and was like, 'Fuck, I'm kind of nailing it right now.' But if there had been anyone else in the room, maybe my bandmates would've been fine, but if there had been anyone else in the room I would have thought too much about it and I wouldn't have been able to write those parts and certainly execute them, because of that thing you're saying. As soon as you're aware that someone is perceiving you, and someone's gonna say some shit just because they love to hear their own voice, it kind of scares me back into myself.""The singer recalled breaking out the guitar for a ""Tiny Desk"" performance, explaining, ""What little guitar, I played for that, I was like, 'Oh god. It's gonna happen. I'm going to see those comments.'""Listen to Hayley Williams + Wet Leg on The Face Podcast27 Women Who Pioneered Hard Rock + Heavy Metal";2022-12-30;https://loudwire.com/concern-sexist-comments-why-paramore-hayley-williams-doesnt-play-guitar-live/;2023-01-01;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRECONCERNOVERSEXISTCOMMENTSISWHYPARAMORE’SHAYLEYWILLIAMSDOESN’T‘DARE’PLAYGUITARLIVE

""I've been receiving treatment at a hospital in Berlin and that team of Doctors has been nothing short of fantastic. But, at the same time they strongly advised me to stop the tour and go back to L.A. and begin my rehab.""Lawless continues, ""But it's hard for them to understand, this is the only 40th Anniversary I'm ever going to get, not to mention the fans that have stood by us this entire time have waited over 3 years, and because of the pandemic suffered 3 different sets of tour postponements. I go back to Berlin on Friday for 2 days for more treatments which means both the shows in Italy will be missed. At the start the Doctors there told me without rest and rehab I would definitely get worse. As hard as I've pushed through these shows, they were right. The show last night in Zurich was cut short by 2 songs, and I do apologize for that but the pain reached a point where I could no longer perform … My legs were giving out on me and it got dangerous.""He adds, ""I will not be able to stand to do the remaining 5 shows, so the compromise I reached with the Doctors was if I would stay seated, in a chair to do these last 5 then they will give me clearance to finish the tour and do those remaining 5 shows. I've never done this before, but please understand, my intention is to finish this tour, come hell or high water.""READ MORE: Why W.A.S.P.

The fan response in every venue was unique n' special!"" Rose tweets. ""Japan, Thailand n' Singapore!!""Then Rose wrote about how much of a fan he was of Nazareth and McCafferty, who had string of successful albums in the '70's and 80's. Their 1974 cover of ""Love Hurts"" was their most popular hit.""Haven't addressed this... been a tough pill to swallow,"" Rose continues. ""Very, very sad to learn of the passing of Dan McCafferty of Nazareth. I learned a day or so after rt b4 r show. Was in a bit of a surreal headspace on stage for several songs. Went on a Nazareth binge for a few days. Thanks Dan n' all of Nazareth for all the music over the years. Their music n' Dan's voice will always have a special place in my heart. Rest in peace Dan.""Gun's 'N' Roses would have played Bangkok, Thailand the day after McCafferty died, meaning Axl was in the ""surreal headspace"" during that show.

Loudwire;Igor Cavalera Credits 'Out of the Ordinary' Bill Ward for His Early Drumming Inspiration;The Cavalera brothers sing Ward's praises as a musician and a person.;"Most of today's top players had musicians that inspired them to pick up their chosen instrument, and while Cavalera Conspiracy's Igor Cavalera says that he was already into rock music when he came across Black Sabbath, Bill Ward's playing was one of the things that inspired him to pursue the drums.Speaking with Revolver (as seen below), Igor recalls, “It’s a funny story because my father had a bunch of records, and later, Max and I were going through his collection and we found the first Black Sabbath record in the middle of it. That was after we were already into rock music – not so much metal, but more like rock. And then, of course, Black Sabbath became one of those bands that are still my favorite, I still listen to those first records.""""Bill Ward, he’s one of those guys that inspired me, in the beginning, to play the drums,"" says Cavalera, explaining, ""The way that he was always pushing the limits with different percussions. He was out of the ordinary, he was the one.”When asked about what made Ward's playing so special to him, the drummer responded, ""I think the most unique thing is that, in a time when a lot of drummers would just follow the guitars and be normal, he was trying different things, he was going off. And, at times, it seems like the whole band was actually trying to catch up with him. For me, that was a huge lesson, because he put the drum in the front instead of just being the typical drummer who will only follow a riff, only follow the bass line. He was actually throwing a few curveballs back there and I think that, for me, that was the reason that made me look into him as a different drummer.""Cavalera Conspiracy frontman Max Cavalera then shared a memory of his brother getting to meet and hang with Ward. ""One of my coolest memories of Igor was actually playing with Black Sabbath. I think it was somewhere in Europe and Bill actually let Igor sit behind him,"" recalled the vocalist. ""After the show, he gave him his bandana. And I remember Igor was freaking out, of course, you would, that's his idol giving him a personal thing that he wore, a bandana, that's like, 'Alright, I can die now.'""""What a great idol he picked, because he's such a good guy, you know, he's a good-hearted guy,"" says Cavalera. ""There's nothing worse than worshiping somebody and finding out that the guy you'd been worshiping is a total asshole. [laughs] He's just an awesome, really nice guy. And one time he met my kids, met Zyon and Igor, and he was telling them about drummers that they should listen to, some guys from the '50s. And I was like, 'Oh, shit, this is crazy!' But yeah, that's a great pick.""Max and Igor Cavalera will carry on the inspiration they found in Ward this summer when Cavalera Conspiracy hit the road.

Loudwire;New Def Leppard Song Brings Big Riffs + Big Hooks;The opening track off their new album.;"Def Leppard are back with ""Take What You Want,"" the second single off their long-awaited new album, Diamond Star Halos.The track brings both big riffs and big hooks — two hallmarks of the Def Lep sound that catapulted the band to superstardom in the '80s and into the early '90s and have kept them atop the heap ever since. They're not out to create a whole new genre of music in the 2020s, which singer Joe Elliott recently said theatrical rock band Ghost did with their new album, Impera, this year.For the veteran rockers, they're still doing what they do best on a high level as ""Take What You Want"" brings a burly, super catchy guitar riff that drives the entire track, tuned a bit lower than the old days, offering a nice bottom-heavy crunch.Take a listen further down the page.""Take What You Want"" is the opening track on Def Leppard's new album, followed by previously released single ""Kick,"" just two of a total of 15 songs. Diamond Star Halos drops on May 27 and pre-orders can be placed here.Catch Def Leppard on tour this spring and summer with Motley Crue, Poison, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and more at these tour stops.Def Leppard, ""Take What You Want"" Lyrics (via AZ Lyrics)Life's complicatedLove it or hate itI'm in this to winYou don't have to believe itTake it or leave itJust let it beginFrom two different worldsWe come crashing inIt's like a brand new dayStill shoulder to shoulderSoldier to soldierSo show me the waySo take what you wantTake what you needTake anythingBut this [?]'s not for meSo take what you likeIf you like what you seeThere's a price to be paid'Cause it sure ain't for freeLife is [?]But I don't expect it[?]Don't try to move meIt sounds like a movie[?] is realFrom two different worldsWe come crashing inIt's like a perfect stormStill shoulder to shoulderSoldier to soldierSo just bring it onSo take what you wantTake what you needTake anythingBut this [?]'s not for meSo take what you likeIf you like what you seeThere's a price to be paid'Cause it sure ain't for freeAll alone, return to stoneAs the king is overthrownThe truth begins to shedAnd it's mine for now and foreverSo take what you wantTake what you needTake anythingBut this [?]'s not for meSo take what you likeIf you like what you seeThere's a price to be paid'Cause it sure ain't for freeWhoa-whoa, whoa-whoaWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoaWhoa-whoa, whoa-whoaWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoaDef Leppard, ""Take What You Want""Top 30 Hair Metal Albums";2022-04-20;https://loudwire.com/def-leppard-take-what-you-want-song-lyrics/;2022-04-20;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRENEWDEFLEPPARDSONGBRINGSBIGRIFFS+BIGHOOKS
Loudwire;Woodstock Organizer Michael Lang Dies at 77;Lang co-created the Woodstock Music and Art Festival in 1969 when he was just 24.;"Michael Lang, the man who helped create one of the most iconic moments in music history with the organization of Woodstock in 1969, has died. He was 77.Lang died last night (Jan. 8) at Sloan-Kettering hospital in New York. Representative and longtime family friend, Michael Pagnotta, confirmed the promoter's death, saying it was caused by a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Lang, John P. Roberts, Joel Rosenman and Artie Kornfeld co-created the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. The festival was dubbed ""Three Days of Peace and Music,"" and drew 400,000 people to Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York. The lineup for the event included Joan Baez, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and many more.“Everybody was crazy,” Baez told Rolling Stone in 2009. “I guess the collective memories that people have, I have in a sense. It’s the mud and the cops roasting hot dogs and people wandering around in the nude. And the fact that, looking back, it was in fact a huge deal. It was like a perfect storm and I realized that Woodstock was like the eye of the hurricane because it was different. It was this weekend of love and intimacy and attempts at beauty and at caring and at being political.”Lang was just 24 when he helped created the festival. “Woodstock came at a really dark moment in America,” Lang also told Rolling Stone in 2009. “An unpopular war, a government that was unresponsive, lots of human rights issues–things were starting to edge toward violence for people to make their points. And along came Woodstock, which was this moment of hope.”After the success of Woodstock, Lang created Just Sunshine Records in 1971, signing a young Billy Joel. He also co-produced another Woodstock festival in 1994 to mark it's 25th anniversary. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Green Day and Nine Inch Nails all performed. Later, he helped create Woodstock '99 and attempted to host a 50th-anniversary of Woodstock, but the event was scrapped.Lang is survived by his wife Tamara, their sons, Harry and Laszlo, and his daughters, LariAnn, Shala and Molly. Loudwire would like to send our deepest condolences to Lang's loved ones at this time.Rockers We Lost in 2021R.I.P. to the rockers who died in 2021.";2022-01-09;https://loudwire.com/woodstock-organizer-michael-lang-dies-at-77/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWOODSTOCKORGANIZERMICHAELLANGDIESAT77
Loudwire;David Draiman Reacts to Phoebe Bridgers' 'Down With the Sickness' Show Entrance;That's how you start a show.;"Phoebe Bridgers has been making headlines in the rock community for a few years now, but did you know that she often uses Disturbed's ""Down With the Sickness"" as her entrance song during her performances? David Draiman took notice, and has praised the singer for her use of the track.According to Setlist.fm, Bridgers first started her show with ""Down With the Sickness"" as early as April of 2022, so we're all a bit late with catching on. However, the singer is currently one of the supporting acts on Taylor Swift's massive Eras tour, and someone uploaded a TikTok of her coming onstage to the Disturbed hit that caught the attention of Draiman himself.In the video, Bridgers' name can be seen written in a metal font on the stage's side monitors as the animalistic drum intro to ""Down With the Sickness"" blasts through the speakers, and then flames engulf her name on the screens as her band takes the stage. Though one might not expect many Swifties to be fans of Disturbed, the crowd actually seemed pretty into it.Then, Bridgers and the band broke into her song ""Motion Sickness,"" so perhaps the use of the Disturbed track is intentional because of the similarity in the song titles.READ MORE: What 10 Artists Thought About Huge Bands That Covered Their Songs""This is absolutely amazing!"" Draiman wrote in a tweet with a link to the TikTok. ""Love it!

She was also invited to cover Metallica's ""Nothing Else Matters"" for their 2021 Blacklist album, which featured covers of songs from The Black Album by artists from all different genres.The 12 Most 'Metal' Artists That Aren't Actually MetalThe most metal artists that don't actually belong to the metal genre.";2023-05-09;https://loudwire.com/disturbed-david-draiman-reacts-phoebe-bridgers-down-with-sickness-show-entrance/;2023-05-10;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREDAVIDDRAIMANREACTSTOPHOEBEBRIDGERS''DOWNWITHTHESICKNESS'SHOWENTRANCE
Loudwire;Flea's Daughter Used RHCP's First Grammy Award as a Garden Shovel;It was a while before Flea even knew about it.;"Last week, Red Hot Chili Peppers were immortalized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, making them the 2,717th recipient of such an honor. When talking to KROQ about the historic moment, bassist Flea recalled another prestigious award — his first-ever Grammy — and how his daughter had used the trophy as a garden shovel, unbeknownst to him.A Grammy award, for many artists, is a career-defining moment and the opportunity to bring home that coveted golden gramophone is generally one that is not taken lightly... nor taken to the tool shed.When pressed about the Walk of Fame star recently bestowed upon the legendary alt-rock group, Flea told KROQ, ""It’s like a Grammy. Put it this way, I’m grateful to win a Grammy, Grammys are awesome, but after we won our first Grammy, like three years later, my mom said, ‘Michael, where’s your Grammy?’, and I was like, ‘I don’t know, mom, I put it somewhere.'""Evidently some time had gone by and Flea had yet to locate the trophy.""Months after that, my gardener came out of the backyard in the garden and you know how the Grammy looks like an old record player with the horn on it? My daughter had unscrewed it and was using it as a shovel for the garden. It had been out there in the dirt for the whole winter. It had been out in the dirt for the whole winter and stuff,"" the bassist continued.The whole ordeal is reflective of Flea's his attitude toward such accolades and he further explained, ""I’m just not really an awards guy. I don’t sit around or look at them or anything. Just being part of that street. When we were doing that thing [receiving the Walk of Fame honor] yesterday, I talked about panhandling on that street when I was 11 years old…That’s where I grew up, man. When I first looked at the street looking at the stars and all the people, imagining what it was, to be in the show business or to be an entertainer. To be a part of it, there’s just so much history there, it’s really nice."" ""That street has been a part of me since I was a little kid,"" he added, taking note that he hasn't lost touch of where he came from. ""Wherever I go in the world, it always comes with me. To be a part of it forever is really beautiful to me…I don’t know if the format and the way we do it is the best way or not, but it’s a weird thing. The competition aspect of it is weird, [not] the celebration of art and culture.”Fortunately for Flea, Red Hot Chili Peppers have scored six Grammy victories, so there should be a handful more shovels... err... trophies... laying around his new $14 million home.Catch Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour in Europe and North America later this year as they head out in support of their new album, Unlimited Love, their first with guitarist John Frusciante since 2006's Stadium Arcadium.Best Rock Album Grammy - Who Won and Who Should've WonWhat's your take on the past winners?Rock Musicians With Hollywood Walk of Fame StarsDoing time on Hollywood and Vine.";2022-04-05;https://loudwire.com/flea-daughter-red-hot-chili-peppers-grammy-garden-shovel/;2022-04-06;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREFLEA'SDAUGHTERUSEDRHCP'SFIRSTGRAMMYAWARDASAGARDENSHOVEL
Loudwire;Megan Fox Praises Machine Gun Kelly’s ‘Grace and Maturity’ in Grammy Loss;She says watching his personal growth is more rewarding than seeing him accept an award.;"While Machine Gun Kelly has occasionally spoken with bravado about his accomplishments, the rapper-turned-rocker came at his Grammy loss over the weekend from a place of humility, and it's something that didn't go unnoticed by his fiancee, actress Megan Fox. Fox penned a sweet message for MGK after losing out on the Best Rock Album category, praising his ""grace and maturity.""Speaking with E! News on the Grammys red carpet, the musician humbly offered, “Ultimately, I’m really happy to be in the company of such great musicians. I didn’t take the category home, and I almost feel like I asked for that lesson. Like, I felt like I lacked self-love, and I was valuing myself so much on career accomplishments that I needed this. The car ride here was very cathartic for me … I need to appreciate what I already have, and once that self-love happens for me, things like the awards and all that will come.”Shortly after his loss (Ozzy Osbourne's Patient Number 9 won over Kelly's Mainstream Sellout), MGK also spoke with Entertainment Tonight, revealing that he's been on a journey to discovering his self-worth. ""It was more cathartic, and I learned a bigger lesson in the 45-minute car ride that I had on the way here than I think I've learned in 30 years,"" he told ET. ""It's the beginning of my journey of self-worth,"" he added, taking the loss in stride.Complimenting the musician, Fox posted, ""Congratulations on being in the very small percentage of artists who have received a Grammy nomination. You have handled this process with a grace and maturity that I haven’t seen from you before and I’m so proud of you.""She continued, ""Watching you walk in humility and gratitude, watching you grow into yourself and become a better man is an immeasurably more satisfying experience than watching you accept an award. Although those will come… and this is irrelevant I guess but I will just never ever get over how beautiful your face is. I hope one day you’ll see yourself the way I see you. I love you and I’ll keep this memory of you forever.""Machine Gun Kelly's Mainstream Sellout did top the Billboard 200 Album Chart upon its release in 2022. The album yielded five singles including ""Papercuts,"" ""Emo Girl"" and ""Maybe."" Kelly's Mainstream Sellout was nominated against Osbourne's Patient Number 9 as well as The Black Keys' Dropout Boogie, Elvis Costello & the Imposters' The Boy Named If, Idles' Crawler and Spoon's Lucifer on the Sofa.The musician could add to his trophy case soon, though the honors may not be ones he's particularly proud of. The MGK-starring film, Good Mourning, was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards, celebrating the worst in filmmaking over the past year. As an actor, Kelly goes by his given name Colson Baker, and he's up for Worst Actor, Worst Director and Worst Onscreen Combo alongside fellow musician Mod Sun.

Loudwire;Mike Mushok Addresses Whether Staind Shows Will Get Political;Here's what fans can expect.;"Though Aaron Lewis is known for being outspoken during his solo shows, Staind fans most likely won't have to anticipate hearing about politics during their upcoming concerts. Guitarist Mike Mushok addressed the topic during an interview an Audacy Check In.Before 2021, Staind hadn't gone out on the road for an actual tour since 2014, but Lewis has toured in support of his country solo works. Over the last year, the singer debuted two songs with a strong political message during his concerts as a solo artist — ""I Ain't Made in China"" and ""Let's Go Fishin'."" Prior to that, he's addressed political and social issues onstage as well. During one particular show in July of 2022, he asserted that he won't stop talking about politics, as taking a stand is the only way things change.However, he apparently plans to stop talking about them when he's onstage with his bandmates in Staind — unless an opportunity presents itself.“There’s not really a conversation. I mean, I do feel like, and even Aaron said, he goes ‘My country career is really where I deal with that. Staind, not so much,’"" Mushok told Audacy host Jason Bailey. ""That’s something that he’s kind of said, so I mean, listen, people in the audience know who Aaron is and what he says. So sometimes that comes up – certain chants will happen during our shows from time to time. So, whatever.”See the full interview below.READ MORE: Mike Mushok Couldn't Be Happier With Staind's New Album - 'We've Evolved, Here We Are'Staind just released a new song yesterday (April 19) called ""Lowest in Me,"" which was their first bit of new music in 12 years.

Loudwire;Interview - How (Don't Call 'Em a Supergroup) L.S. Dunes Saved Its Own Members' Lives;Anthony Green (Circa Survive) and Tucker Rule (Thursday) needed this band more than they realized.;"For anti-supergroup L.S. Dunes, the magnetism of friendship and love of their craft made coming together a no-brainer, especially during a particularly turbulent moment for the industry and within their personal lives.In this excerpt from a conversation with drummer Tucker Rule (Thursday) and vocalist Anthony Green (Circa Survive) we learn just how much swapping sound files during a global pandemic helped heal their hearts and minds.The band's lineup is a scene dream, also comprised of guitarist Frank Iero (My Chemical Romance), guitarist Travis Stever (Coheed & Cambria) and bassist Tim Payne (Thursday), and while fans may be quick to brand them a supergroup, that's not the sentiment these members harbor. It isn't about assembling an all-star band as the scene equivalent of the Justice League superheroes and more about bonding with like-minded musicians and, more importantly, dear friends.Being cutoff from our regular social circles and points of contact helped frame a new perspective for us all amid the pandemic, and losing out on this essential element of the human experience led Green in particular down dark paths. Prioritizing mental health, and with the support of his L.S. Dunes bandmates, he confronted these issues and is grateful to have bettered his relationships as a result.Get your copy of L.S. Dunes' 'Past Lives' album (out Nov. 11) here and follow the band on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Spotify.They're not a supergroup, they're SUPER BUDS!TUCKER RULE: All of us in our bands are the ones that are heads-down, want to write music and enjoy playing music. That's why we all have multiple bands.When we get together, we joke about the ""L.S."" standing for ""low stress"" because we just want it to be fun. People love to throw around the term ""supergroup,"" and we don't like that. We're a group of super buds, and this is just our circle of friendship. It's not like, ""Oh, we've got to get the guy from Coheed and the guy from Circa and the guy from MCR..."" These are my dudes and I know we get along musically.Another thing with ""supergroup"" is that [people think], ""Oh, they're just going do one show here and one show there."" Why start a band if you're not going to go bring it out live? That's our goal — to play as much as we can. This is another full time job.ANTHONY GREEN: I don't really get to have many friends that are outside of this business. It kind of sucks because you end up feeling kind of lonely when you're not working or when you're home.Once we started connecting more, it was like, “Man, I'm talking to Tucker every other day.” I didn't realize how much I was lacking in my life. It's hard to even find two people that connect on a creative and personal way level so that they can make stuff, so when people have bands that are so good together, it's like, “These guys just bring out the best in each other!”It’s hard to find people that creatively mesh well, and this is five people who fit together creatively just perfectly.L.S. Dunes, ""Permanent Rebellion"" Music VideoIt's not business, it's personalAG: If at any moment Travis called us and was like, ""Hey, I'm going through this and I need X, Y, and Z,"" that's the most important thing from the get-go. No matter what comes our way, we're able to deal with it because we're not looking at this like it's a business, we're looking at it like this big art project.We all know from our other bands that when you have a business that's run cutthroat where it's about the bottom line or getting as many streams, or making as much money, it can become convoluted. Whereas, if you have a situation where everybody's just looking out for one another because of the fact that this is an emotionally driven band where we're processing a lot of really heavy shit together, you end up feeling so safe and secure and strong because you know that everybody has your back.The most important thing is that everybody's mental health and personal relationships. Everybody's life is more important than just a song or a stream. That makes a project strong and fun... and no one's judging [personally or creatively].Creativity is life-sustainingTR: I would wake up or go to bed hoping somebody would write a riff so I could wake up in the morning and get to work on it [laughs]. And vice versa — I would write a drum beat and send it out and I'd be like, ""Please, somebody work on this"" and then I'd get something back. It [felt] like it was Christmas and it was during COVID, too, so there was very little to look forward to.I think it saved all of our lives, to be honest with you.It was a time where none of us knew what was going to happen with our industry. I know everybody had it rough and all industries suffered, but I can only speak for myself and the music industry was in shambles. We knew that it might not come back for a really long time and we had no idea how we were all going to make money. When you've done this for 20 years, you kind of get really good at it and not good at other things. For me, getting another job was not an option.All of us are dads and at that time I had an infant. I was trying to figure out how to make money and was writing these songs with these dudes that I love, not thinking that we would make money from it.So, why did it save our lives? It was like this was out of necessity to feel like we were a part of something, again.L.S. Dunes, ""2022"" Music VideoEven so, life was still very challenging through all thisAG: We got laid off [amid the pandemic]. People were talking about when shows come back or when things reopened, but it was so scary [having the mindset of], ""Okay, well let's save up until everything comes back,"" and then I was just like, ""Hey, this is never going come back. It's never going to be like it was and we're going have to get used to playing through our computers."" It was almost like a comforting thing for me to close the book on that chapter in my life.I was so depressed. I had been going to AA and NA meetings where you make a pretty hardcore connection with other addicts and people who are struggling and that was gone. My therapist was not seeing people face to face. Yeah. [This band] was almost like an excuse to miss therapy a bunch.I was also diagnosed as bipolar shortly after my my overdose. I was struggling with it, and I didn't want to admit that I was bipolar. I was really scared of even saying it. It's crazy to think about it now, but I just didn't want anybody to know. I wasn't medicating at all, and I was trying to figure out how to go through life without getting fucked up to deal with my problems, but also not doing any of the recommended things that you do to manage bipolar.I was in this manic low, hallucinating, and this project coming to me at that moment... I hate saying this because your kids are the reason why you want to live... I thought my kids would be better off without me. I was convinced that I was just going to be a bad dad, and that I was going hurt them at some point.That's what friends are forIf I didn't change my shit, I would've [wound up hurting them in some way], but the faith that Tucker, Tim, Frank and Travis had in me really did so much for my confidence and did so much for me in that moment and in those few months. It was like a fucking life preserver. I wasn't looking at my family, my life and my career as something worth fighting for. I was just so lost and there was so much joy anchored in the fact that I had this band that wanted to make songs with me, that believed in me, that wanted me to be in their group.It really helped me see that my kids would be better if I got my shit together and went to therapy and figured out how to maintain. My family and my friendships would all be better—nobody'd be better off if I was dead.When you don't see that yourself sometimes, it takes somebody else reminding you. And these guys did that and the songs did that. This band and these songs were like a little box of sanity. It became like a drug, almost. When I was feeling crazy, I would think about the fact that we had this thing that we were building and it would bring me back to earth every time.Thanks to Tucker Rule and Anthony Green for the interview.

Loudwire;Why Paramore's Hayley Williams Says People View 2000s Pop-Punk with 'Rose-Tinted Glasses';'It was an alternative scene for a reason – it was weird.';As the singer of one of the most beloved pop-punk/emo bands of the last 20 years – Paramore – Hayley Williams has plenty to say about the golden age of those styles. For instance, she recently declared that the “alternative scene” wasn’t as great as many people might remember.In a chat with NME published yesterday (Feb. 10), Williams spoke about the group’s latest studio LP – This is Why – as well as the importance of “competitiveness,” inclusivity and “feel[ing] seen” in music (especially for women).Get Paramore Tickets HereWhen asked about Paramore’s “contentious relationship with pop-punk’s heyday” – as interviewer Erica Campbell put it – Williams didn’t hold back in sharing her views:People look back with these rose-tinted glasses. They talk about the good and forget the rest. It was an alternative scene for a reason – it was weird. Those kids were bullied, that’s why so many guys in those bands wrote shitty songs about ex-girlfriends. I just get angry about the injustice of a bunch of people who were bullied, essentially creating a world where other people didn’t feel welcome.She’s certainly got a point, and it’s not the first time Williams has discussed her experiences with aggression, sexism, bigotry and the like within the music industry.Last month, for instance, she went into depth about how NOFX co-founder “Fat” Mike Burkett “used to tell people that [she] gave good rim jobs onstage when [she] was 19 years old.” She added: “And I feel strongly that without young women, people of color and also the queer community, I just think we would still be where we were then.”In December 2022, Williams revealed that she’s hesitant to play guitar live because of “stupid comments on the internet” regarding women’s abilities to use the instrument. Prior to headlining When Were Young Festival last October, she even shared an open letter regarding her history with emo and pop-punk.In it, she stated:To be a young girl in love with this scene was to have the hope that I might find my own way to belong. It took years to find that belonging. It's taken a lot of unlearning. A lot of untangling knots I didn't even know were there. What I did know was that for every “Take off your top!” or snarky punkzine review … for every dramatic headline pinned on my name, or any season of self-doubt … no one was going to define Paramore but Paramore.Luckily, Williams and company are continuing to defy the haters, with This is Why garnering many positive reviews thus far. They’re also gearing up for their 2023 international tour (with Bloc Party, Foals, The Linda Lindas and/or Genesis Owusu). You can see the full list of dates here, and purchase tickets here!There Are Only Two Songs Paramore Have Never Played LiveWhat are they?;2023-02-10;https://loudwire.com/paramore-hayley-williams-pop-punk-rose-tinted-glasses/;2023-02-12;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWHYPARAMORE'SHAYLEYWILLIAMSSAYSPEOPLEVIEW2000SPOP-PUNKWITH'ROSE-TINTEDGLASSES'
Loudwire;Mick Jagger Posts Emotional Video Honoring First Anniversary of Charlie Watts’ Death;Watch the emotional tribute.;"Mick Jagger honored the first anniversary of the passing of his longtime bandmate Charlie Watts with an emotional video. The video displays The Rolling Stones drummer over the years to the tune of ""'Till the Next Goodbye"" by The Rolling Stones as well as a voiceover by Jagger.The video starts off with an image of a young Watts looking and smiling at the camera, then shows images of him at rehearsals and shows, on an airplane, as well as images with Jagger and with the rest of the band.Jagger's voiceover (which begins at the 1:11 mark) says, ""You know, I miss Charlie because you know he had a great sense of humor and we also were outside of the band, you know, we used to hang out quite a lot and have interesting times. We loved sports, we'd go to football, we'd go to cricket games, and we would have other interests apart from just the music. But you know, of course, I, you know, really miss Charlie so much.""The tribute video, which you can watch below, ends with an image of Jagger embracing Watts tightly as Watts smiles. The late drummer was with The Rolling Stones since 1963 and passed away a year ago in a hospital in London at the age of 80.The Rolling Stones played their first show without him on Sept. 21 and Jagger said to the audience ""it's a bit of a poignant night for us because it's our first tour in 59 years that we've done without our lovely Charlie Watts.""He dedicated the show to Watts by saying, ""We all miss Charlie so much. We miss him as a band, we miss him as friends, on and off the stage. We've got so many memories of Charlie, and I'm sure some of you that have seen us before have got memories of Charlie as well. And I hope you will remember him like we do. So we'd like to dedicate this show to Charlie - let's have a drink to Charlie.""Watch Mick Jagger's Emotional Video Honoring the First Anniversary of Charlie Watts' DeathRockers We've Lost in 2022Rock + Metal Musicians Who Died in 2022";2022-08-23;https://loudwire.com/mick-jagger-emotional-video-honoring-first-anniversary-charlie-watts-death/;2022-08-24;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREMICKJAGGERPOSTSEMOTIONALVIDEOHONORINGFIRSTANNIVERSARYOFCHARLIEWATTS’DEATH
Loudwire;Paramore Fan With Disability Shares Emotional Account of Singing 'Misery Business' Onstage With Band;Watch the special moment take place and read Macayla's reaction.;"As many fans are now aware, Paramore have returned ""Misery Business"" to their sets on this tour after previously removing it. With the group currently out on tour, they've also invited fans to the stage to sing along on the track, often making the fans' days in the process. That was the case for 23-year-old actress and artist Macayla Smith, also a person with a disability, who recently joined the band's Atlanta performance at the Tabernacle, then shared what that special moment meant to her via social media.As can be seen in the video below, fans were selected from the audience and Macayla got the call to the stage, with some assistance by Paramore's security, who helped lift her from the pit area and got her safely to the stage along with her walker. The moment moved many in the crowd, with singer Hayley Williams coming over to hug her as well as one of the fellow ""singers"" pulled from the audience.Smith, a longtime Paramore fan, was visibly excited, screaming as she was being called to the stage, and later calling it ""the best night of my entire life."" The moment was a spontaneous one, too, as she would later reveal, explaining that had she known the moment was coming she would have been prepared to express to Williams what it and the band meant to her.Instead, she penned a heartfelt message via her Instagram account, in which she highlighted the welcome nature she's always felt from the Paramore community as the band has always put accessibility at the forefront with fans. Read Macayla's message to the group in full below.The love of my life is Paramore. I've been a Paramore fan since at least 11 years old (might've been earlier). And I've been going to their concerts since I was 13. I am 23 years old now. If you would have told little me that ~12 years later I would SING ON STAGE WITH MY FAVORITE BAND?!?! I never ever would have believed you. The band that has been with me through everything?!?! I never thought that I would actually get chosen for Misery Business. If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have written them a letter to give to them. The letter would have said something along the lines of ""Thank you for sharing your art and your heart with the world. I know that you are not perfect (i.e. Idle Worship lol). In truth, it is your willingness to be open about your imperfections and vulnerabilies that makes us fans feel seen. That is what is so special about Paramore. Your honesty about your struggles--with mental health, with heartbreaks, with identity, with society, ect.--makes us feel understood. It makes us feel like there's someone else out there who gets it. Your art helps us get through our own struggles and hard times. One of the reasons I love Paramore's music so deeply is because it always feels like a vehicle for catharsis. It allows us to scream, vent, cry, rage, dance, and love freely. It's a vehicle for expression. It's the roar in my chest whenever I sing one of your songs; it's resonances reaching down to the bone and farther still... Paramore is also a family. It has brought me to so many places and I've made so many wonderful friends through Paramore. It's a community like no other. It is full of love and passion. It will always feel like home to me. Paramore will always be the love of my life. So thank you for your art. We are all better because of it.Check out footage captured of this special moment for Macayla below.@chasingmik @Paramore I’ve seen you more times than I can count!

Loudwire;Ronnie Radke - I'll Never Apologize For Things I Said in the Past;He doesn't think 'cancel culture' will last.;"There are a lot of musicians who've said things in the past that wouldn't be tolerated in today's media climate, including Falling in Reverse frontman Ronnie Radke. But, he says he won't apologize for what he's said in the past, and believes it's ""insane"" how careful people need to be with their words now.Falling in Reverse just released a new track called ""Zombified"" a couple of days ago. During a discussion with Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez, Radke explained the meaning behind the song, particularly the lines ""Oh no they’ll never let go / Of something you said 10 years ago / They’re cancelling you / And they won’t stop till everybody’s / Zombified.""""I guess that's the very thing that inspired it — whenever I'm doing interviews or anything nowadays, I worry if I say the wrong thing. That is insane to me, I can't believe that. And it's very minimal things. It's like, 'Well if I say this, this person might get upset,'"" the singer said.""I feel like everybody feels that way now,"" he continued. ""Most people that are in any sort of public eye or doing anything that works for a big company, they have to constantly worry if they're saying the right thing, or if something they said f--king literally 10 years ago — when it was okay to say it — is gonna be not okay to say it now and your whole life is over. You're fired, your career is over, you said something 20 years ago that was okay, but now it's not and you're done. You're a piece of shit.""Radke believes the problem is that people aren't given the chance to grow, and that while sometimes being scrutinized can be helpful if you actually did do or say something wrong, other times it seems ""ridiculous.""""I'll never apologize, because something I said 10 years ago was literally okay then,"" he affirmed. ""[If] I said something in the '90s that's not okay now, it's unacceptable, come on. It doesn't make me a bad person. What would make me a bad person is if I continued, even knowing it's not right. There's just a fine line you gotta walk. It just feels like you have to walk on eggshells. It's hard to be any type of celebrity nowadays.""Tune into Loudwire Nights tonight at 7PM ET to hear the rest of the interview.

Loudwire;Richie Faulkner Wanted to Go Home Instead of to Hospital Amid Nearly Fatal Aorta Rupture;The Judas Priest guitarist recalls the experience and how lucky he considers himself.;"Judas Priest's Richie Faulkner considers himself lucky in many ways after the events of Sept. 26, 2021. That was the night he was onstage with Judas Priest at the Louder Than Life festival in Louisville when his aorta ruptured as the band was finishing their performance. In a new interview with Guitar World, Faulkner details some of the events that happened in order for him to have gotten the emergency surgery he needed that night.Faulkner recalls his chest tightening during the show, feeling moderate pain with some shortness of breath, but he was determined to finish the performance. Video was later posted of the musician playing ""Painkiller"" as his aortic rupture was happening. Following the performance, Faulker collapsed into a chair at the side of the stage.“I needed to finish the song, but I had the presence of mind to come back from the edge of the stage just in case I passed out from fatigue,” Faulkner revealed. “Luckily, Metallica was headlining that night or we would have played a full set and I probably would have dropped dead onstage.”“If I had known my heart had split open and I was bleeding into my chest cavity, I might have handled it a bit differently. But I had no idea,” Faulkner added. “I got my jeans and T-shirt on. I didn’t think it was anything really serious and I didn’t want to make a fuss. I probably would have kept going if we did an encore.”While it was initially suggested by paramedics that Faulkner go to the hospital, the musician initially had another thought in mind. “The original plan before the show was to drive home and have a few days off at the house to spend with our new baby,” Faulkner says. “Then I was going to fly to Denver to meet the band and carry on with the tour. I figured I could still do that. I’d been healthy before the show, so I was like, ‘Obviously, it’s not a big deal. Let’s just get in the car and go back home. It’s going to be okay.’ There’s no question I would have died in the car on the way back home if I even made it to the car.”At the urging of his medics and his girlfriend Mariah Lynch, the guitarist eventually decided to go to the hospital, and luckily the festival grounds were just five miles from the Rudd Heart and Lung Center at U of L Health-Jewish Hospital.Faulker says that the aortic rupture ""came right out of the blue,"" and that he really hadn't noticed any warning signs prior that seemed out of ordinary for his given profession.“In February 2020, I had a physical in England and the doctor checked my blood pressure and said it was a little high, but she said it was okay and there was nothing to worry about,"" recalls Faulkner. ""The Kentucky show was in September the following year, and there was never any indication of any problem before I got halfway through 'Painkiller.'”One other thing that surprisingly worked in Faulkner's favor was the fact that he was playing a live show just as the incident was happening. The guitarist says, “One question I had for the doctors was how I was able to go on for so long, because, yeah, once these things rupture you’ve usually got minutes and you’re gone. They think that maybe my adrenaline was so high because we were playing and that my heart was pumping hard enough and fast enough to keep me going long enough to get pumped up with more adrenaline and keep me going to the hospital. So I can literally say the power of heavy metal kept me alive long enough to save my life. I was literally, possibly saved by metal.”The procedure took 11 hours, but Faulkner reveals that they were able to repair the aortic rupture and take care of an aneurysm as well. ""There was no heart attack to fix,"" he adds. ""My heart was completely fine. It was the aorta that burst, so they repaired it with a mechanical valve. And they repaired other parts of my heart with bits of metal since the dissection caused a lot of damage. I’m more metal now than ever. I like to joke that I’ve literally got a heart of metal.""He continues, ""I know how serious it was and I know I would have died if I didn’t have these miracle doctors.""

Loudwire;Chris Jericho Powered Through Blood Clots Before Shutting Down 2021 Tour;See how the rocker and wrestler overcame.;"Chris Jericho, the lead vocalist of Fozzy, has revealed that he survived a pulmonary embolism last year while on tour with the hard rock band. It led to the cancellation of the rest of Fozzy's fall 2021 tour due to his doctor's orders. But not before the singer carried on with gigs until he said he could barely walk.Now recovered, the rocker who's also an AEW wrestler looked back on the scare on his Talk Is Jericho podcast, where the entertainer addressed the symptoms that led to his diagnosis as the group traveled.""During this time frame, when I was feeling a little bit kind of short of breath, I was talking to my doctor at home … who said, 'This could be blood clots,'"" Jericho explains. (via Blabbermouth)""[Once we were in the U.K.] I thought, 'Well, I'm not gonna go to the hospital in Bournemouth or Chester,'"" he continues. ""'Let me just wait till I get to London and we can figure out kind of where I'm at.' So we did the Chester gig, and then I had two more shows — Birmingham, where I felt okay, but I knew that we had London after Bournemouth, and that would be kind of the place where I'd get checked out and see kind of what's going on.… I remember saying after the Bournemouth show, 'I can't do another show like this. We need to figure out what's going on.'""After seeing a traveling physician, Jericho was ""really having problems walking."" He adds, ""About an hour later I got a call from the doctor, who said, 'You have blood clots. We can tell by the blood that we drew. You have to go directly to the hospital.' Now — pretty scary. Keep in my mind, I'm in London. I'm thousands of miles away from home in a foreign country, and now I have to go to a hospital. … They tell me very soon after, 'Yes, you've had a pulmonary embolism.' What does that mean? It means that your lungs are filled with blood clots and you are now staying in the hospital. And they went and did an ultrasound and found that there was evidence of a clot that had been in my throat.""Jericho warns, ""If a clot gets in your throat, that's getting into stroke territory. And the reason why these are so dangerous is if the blood clot breaks free and gets into your lungs, you could have some serious issues. … So this is some serious, serious shit here.""Fozzy's latest, Boombox, is one of Loudwire's Best Rock & Metal Albums of 2022 (So Far). Below, see more from the July 8 Talk Is Jericho episode.'Chris Jericho tells the whole story behind his health issue last December that resulted not only in FOZZY canceling shows for the first time but also in the formation of the Jericho Appreciation Society in AEW! Chris details the symptoms that started during FOZZY’s UK Tour that led to his hospitalization and pulmonary embolism diagnosis in London. He speaks candidly about the harrowing days of having trouble breathing, watching his oxygen levels drop, and seeing specialists to help turn his condition around. He discusses his extended hospital stay, being unable to fly before the holidays, and the hard work he put in once he was able to return home to Tampa. Finally, he talks about his physical transformation and how that directly contributed to his heel turn in AEW, teaming up with 2.0 and Danny Garcia, and launching the Jericho Appreciation Society.Talk Is Jericho, ""How I Survived a Pulmonary Embolism"" (Excerpt) - July 8, 2022Rockers Who Hold Charity EventsFind out which of your favorite rockers hold annual events to raise big money for causes close to their hearts.";2022-07-25;https://loudwire.com/chris-jericho-fozzy-blood-clot-throat-tour/;2022-07-28;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRECHRISJERICHOPOWEREDTHROUGHBLOODCLOTSBEFORESHUTTINGDOWN2021TOUR
Loudwire;Tobias Forge Explains Why Haters Are 'A Good Thing' for Ghost - 'Keep on Talking';He has a good point!;"In a new interview with Elliot in the Morning, Ghost mastermind Tobias Forge lightly addressed the negative online comments the band frequently receives and explained why it's ""actually a good thing"" overall.Forge was asked whether or not he gets angry over people trying to figure out what type of stylistic identity to assign to Ghost, to which he replied (transcription via Blabbermouth), ""No, definitely not angry. That is not my problem, really. I don't have a problem with people having a problem with it.""""If I want be the most super-positive person ever and just see everything from a half-full perspective, it's, like, a lot of… Most things today [are] measured by activity — Spotify activity, online activity, whatever — as opposed to 30 years ago when it was sales; one record sold was one unit and that was counted. But nowadays everything is about content and activity,"" he went on.""One thing that people — especially those who aren't really chatting about how good they think we are but how bad they think we are, that adds to the activity,"" Forge explained.On social media, comments help fuel engagement and, as a result, the posts will be seen by a greater number of people. ""So it's actually a good thing,"" said Forge with a laugh, grateful for the online hate. ""So keep on talking. It's all good. It's all fun,"" he mused.Listen to the full interview below.Despite all the negative criticism from fans, it hasn't stopped Ghost from becoming one of the biggest rock/metal bands over the last dozen years as they're now a seasoned arena headliner in North America. Regarding Ghost's arc of success, Forge recently told The Wall Street Journal, ""For me, it’s always been, if you want to make it big, if you want to be a musician, you need to tour all the time. And you need to do, like, five shows in Wisconsin.""He also credited a ""very strong"" merchandising strategy that has been incredibly beneficial to help building that increased level of success by enabling them to tour at a greater scale.Ghost's headlining North American tour with special guests Mastodon and Spiritbox ends on Sept. 23.

Loudwire;Leaked Supreme Court Draft Would Overturn Roe v. Wade - Rockers React;See who's saying what about the leak and the potential huge legal ramifications.;"In one of the most significant legal shifts in U.S. history, it was leaked Monday night (May 2) that the Supreme Court was planning to overturn the long-standing 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that granted federal constitutional protections for abortion rights and would now put the decisions on the legality of abortions within the hands of the governing bodies of the states instead.As revealed by Politico, an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito has circulated inside the court, stating that ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. We hold that Roe and Casey [1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey] must be overruled.” Alito added, “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”According to Politico, a person familiar with the court's deliberations stated that the four Republican-appointed justices had voted with Alito in a conference held after oral arguments in December, while the three Democratic justices were working on one or more dissents, and that how Chief Justice John Roberts would vote or if he was drafting his own opinion remained unclear.While the draft was leaked, the court's ruling will not be finalized until it is published, reportedly within the next two months.As pointed out by Slate, the leaking of a Supreme Court opinion is incredibly rare as the court is one of their more secretive bodies in the country. That has led to speculation about who was behind the leak and the motives involved, as mid-term elections near. President Biden said in a written statement, “If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.”Given the many ramifications of the potential ruling, there has been plenty of discourse about the issues involved online. Several musicians including Disturbed's David Draiman, Shinedown's Zach Myers, Lamb of God's Mark Morton and members of Periphery have contributed to the discussion, sometimes with each other.In addition, one time death metal vocalist turned Virginia delegate Danica Roem offered, ""To my constituents: No matter what happens with the SCOTUS ruling, the 49 years of precedent for your right to safe/legal abortion care will remain in VA *only* b/c of our 21-19 Senate Democratic majority. Majorities matter. Your privacy rights and healthcare are on the ballot.""Read a sampling of the reaction to the leak of the Supreme Court draft to overturn Roe v.

Loudwire;Bruce Dickinson Explains Why He Left Iron Maiden in 1993;'Unless you left, nobody would take anything that you did seriously,' says the singer.;"There's no doubt that Iron Maiden reached new heights during Bruce Dickinson's run as the band's frontman, so why did the musician leave the group in 1993 after the Fear of the Dark album? Dickinson offered some insight into his reasoning during the March 23 stop in Montreal of his current spoken word tour.The shows have provided Dickinson a chance to take fan questions from the audience at each stop and during the Montreal stop, the singer was asked about his exit.As seen in the video shot below (at about 2:14 in) and posted by The Metal Voice (as viewed below), Dickinson recalls, ""Honestly, I was as surprised as anybody else. I don't think people really believed that at the time. You have to change around in your life sometimes.""He then elaborated, ""I just thought that if I stayed with Maiden forever, all I would learn about was what it was like to be in Maiden. And in order to learn what it was like outside Maiden, you have to leave, because, unless you left, nobody would take anything that you did seriously. It would always be, like, 'Oh, bless him. He's doing a solo record. It's not very important really. Let him have his fun and then he can go back to being in Iron Maiden.'""""I hated that, right. So I thought, 'Fuck it. I'll just leave,'"" continued the singer, adding, ""And [people said], 'What happens if your [solo] career doesn't work out.' I said, 'Well that's God or fate saying maybe that's [for] the best.' I said, 'Maybe [it's] better to do that now and do something else with your life than sit there somewhere in fantasy world and end up just grumpy.'""After Dickinson left, Iron Maiden soldiered on with Blaze Bayley at the helm, releasing The X Factor and Virtual XI before Dickinson returned to the group in 1999. Meanwhile, Dickinson made the most of his time away, issuing the solo albums Balls to Picasso, Skunkworks, Accident of Birth and The Chemical Wedding in the six-year span that he was out of the band.Dickinson's current ""An Evening With Bruce Dickinson"" trek is in the home stretch.

Jack Osbourne now has the Twitter verified blue check mark, and he explained his rationale behind agreeing to pay the fee that many have balked at.""So I paid for the blue check mark. I did it because whether you like it or not twitter is the largest free speech platform on earth,"" explained Osbourne. ""I will also support free speech.

""Exactly why a nobody like me paid 8$. Free speech isn’t free. Never has been,"" said another.Meanwhile another fan noted one of the flaws in the reasoning, stating, ""Which is fair.

Loudwire;Gene Simmons Always Says ‘Rock Is Dead,’ Does Paul Stanley Agree?;Do they see eye-to-eye about it?;"We'd be beating a dead horse if we wrote another story about how or why Gene Simmons thinks ""rock is dead"" — he's been saying it for years. But, Classic Rock recently did the lord's work and asked Simmons' bandmate and fellow KISS co-founder, Paul Stanley, if he agrees with the statement.""It’s a great soundbite, but that’s about all it is,"" he responded.So, no, Stanley doesn't agree with the notion, but he does have an interesting way of measuring the current state of rock 'n' roll.""My son Evan is playing all around Los Angeles with a rock band that kicks ass and is getting great crowds, with beautiful models coming, and that’s proof to me that rock’s not dead,"" the rocker said.It's hard to say whether or not models attending concerts have anything to do with the success of the band or the quality of the music, but Stanley then added that what's popular in the mainstream always changes over time.""It ebbs and flows. There’s a lot of rock music being made right now, and some of it may be too derivative to really stake a claim and take it to the next level, but it will happen, it will happen,"" he stated.

Loudwire;Daryl Hall Says He Turned Down Van Halen Offer to Replace David Lee Roth;Forget Van Hagar, we could've had Hall Halen.;"Daryl Hall, of the legendary pop rock duo Hall and Oates, has confirmed that he was once asked to potentially replace David Lee Roth in Van Halen after the singer's mid-'80s departure from the group.At the time, Hall and Oates had just released their 12th full length album, Big Bam Boom, which was greeted with continued success on the back of the smash pop hit ""Out of Touch."" The duo, who released their first record in 1972, were evolving with the times and their sound had become more experimental by bringing modern technology (synthesizers) and recording techniques to the fold.Van Halen had also dabbled in this area, most noticeably on the 1984 hit ""Jump"" and its iconic opening synth part. After they had selected Sammy Hagar as Roth's replacement, this sound came to more prominently define the group as well.But before landing Hagar, guitarist Eddie Van Halen evidently had Hall on a list of suitable successors to ""Diamond Dave.""""Actually, yes,"" Hall told Q104.3 when asked if it was true that Eddie had once approached him and gauged his interest on fronting Van Halen.""I knew those guys really well. We actually shared some people — crew, and things like that,"" Hall continued, ""And Eddie came to a show with Valerie [Bertinelli, his wife at the time]. This goes back, you know? And David had just left the band. And Eddie said, 'Do you want to join Van Halen, man?' He was half joking, but I think he was serious. I really do believe he was serious. And I took it seriously. I went, 'Meh, I think not. I think I've got my own shit going on.'""The pop rock singer and songwriters also confirmed that Hall and Oates' ""Kiss On My List,"" the third single off the duo's 1980 album Voices had a major impact on shaping one of Van Halen's biggest hit songs — ""Jump.""""That is correct,"" Hall said of his song's influence on the track. ""That is what [Eddie] always told me. That inspired 'Jump.'""In 1985, the same year Roth and Van Halen split, Hagar was welcomed to the band, though as bassist Michael Anthony recalled last year, the group's label home (Warner Bros.) had hopes of changing the band's name in conjunction with the lineup change.

But Lemmy kept coming back to one remark over and over. Ozzy says his favorite thing to tell him was ""Your best record was No More Tears"" and Ozzy's response would be, ""Yeah, because you wrote on it, you cunt!""Four songs on the album were co-written by Lemmy and the album became one of the most successful albums of Ozzy's solo career. No More Tears has been certified as four times multi-platinum by the RIAA and has sold four million units.Ozzy saw Kilmister in South America in his latter days, but says the Motorhead leader was not in good health. ""He was so fucked he couldn't speak to anyone. He was sitting at the front, skinny as a rake. He was riddled with cancer at the end, but mind you, he turned round to me and said 'I'm probably going to die soon, I suppose.

Loudwire;Serj Tankian Explains Why He's Cooled on Idea of Large Scale Touring;He reveals the reasons why.;"Serj Tankian has a new EP to support, but you may not see the System of a Down vocalist and solo artist doing extensive touring for some time. During a chat with Metal Injection, the singer revealed that some recent health concerns combined with bit of disinterest have him cooling on the idea of large scale touring at the moment.The touring talk came up during a discussion about the possibility of doing something to pay a nod to System of a Down's Toxicity and Steal This Album anniversaries. After initially shutting down the idea of playing Toxicity as a full set because it was too short, Tankian revealed, ""Based on my health issues and kind of redundancy in doing the same thing over and over again in terms of touring, it's something I'm not very interested in doing at this time. Not just for System, for my own stuff, for orchestra or solo stuff. I just haven't been touring. I also had back surgery last year.""Speaking about his health, he explained, ""I've got certain issues that I'm getting over that are health issues that are affecting my mobility. I mean, I walk fine and I'm able to do stuff and I could perform. But the travel of a tour really, really affects me at this point. That and, to be honest with you, it's not in my creative purview, you know? So a show here and there we've done and might still do. But as far as doing a specific thing, it's not really something where I'm at right now.""The vocalist also spoke of the monotony of a larger scale tour, explaining, ""When you're doing a full tour, those first two or three shows are really exciting, you know? Because you haven't toured in a while and you're playing the sets. You're out there and you're moving around and then you got the same set on the fourth show, fifth show, sixth show. By the 10th show, it's fucking, what's that movie? The Bill Murray one? Groundhog Day. You know, it becomes Groundhog Day. And you still have fun because it's a different audience, different city and all that, but it becomes a bit automatic, mechanical, a bit. And to me, that's redundant artistically. Having one show that's in a special place, done in a special way, is more interesting.""So it does not appear that extensive touring is in Tankian's immediate future. That said, while appearing on the Kyle Meredith With... podcast, the System of a Down frontman did tease earlier this week about their 2023 plans, ""As of now, we haven't talked about anything. We will be making an announcement about something next year that I can't really tell you about. So there is that. But further than that, I can't really say.""For now though, fans can check out Tankian's latest solo work, the Perplex Cities EP that just arrived.

Wade, the legal precedent that had guaranteed Americans' constitutional right to abortion for the last 50 years.It came up during a recent radio interview with the singer, songwriter and guitarist who just released the single ""More Than Machines"" with the veteran English alt-rockers. The tune, which obtusely touches on the topic, will be on Bush's The Art of Survival, out Oct. 2.See Rossdale's interview near the bottom of this post.""To me, it's an obvious thing,"" the British rocker told 93X this week. ""It seems [like] a medieval step in the wrong direction, and it doesn't make sense to me. So I just put it in a song."" (via Blabbermouth)The stanza in ""More Than Machines"" is as follows:Everything wrong should be right, girlsYou in controlNot the governmentNot the governmentRossdale remarked, ""It just sparks conversation. My job as a lyricist is to just kind of capture the time, to capture the zeitgeist or the feeling or the emotion. That's what [my] songs are, from the beginning to now. They're sort of commentaries on what's going on around me that other people relate to.""He added, ""'Girls are in control, not the government' seems pretty straightforward. But just 'Girls are in control' is a powerful statement. I love that. And it would be a better world if women were in power.""Other artists also reacted to the controversial decision representing the court's current supermajority of conservative justices. Rage Against the Machine and Coheed and Cambria donated concert proceeds to reproductive rights organizations. Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong said he was renouncing his U.S. citizenship in defiance. Pearl Jam, Paramore and Nova Twins also voiced opposition.The Bush bandleader continued, musing on other current events, ""I think there's a lack of erosion of the evil that we're seeing. There [aren't] many Russian women involved in the invasion of Ukraine, as far as I can tell. A lot of guys think it's a good idea. A lot of dudes. I haven't seen any women saying, 'This is great.'""However, Rossdale warned, ""I'm not better than anybody; I don't know more than anybody. These things I read about every day, and it sort of filters into my job. That's where I do my work. And I think it provides substance for people to sing about their broken hearts or broken lives and other things that are going on.""Turning to environmentalism, the rocker concluded, ""We are destroying the planet … and nobody seems to care. So, all the time, you've gotta keep doing these songs to just keep the conversation going.""Bush's Gavin Rossdale on 93X - Aug. 4, 2022Bush, ""More Than Machines"" (Lyric Video)Rock + Metal Bands Helping Provide Support for UkraineAmid Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022, several rock and metal bands came up with ways to offer support for affected Ukrainians.

Loudwire;Oli Sykes - BMTH Were Once Portrayed as Motley Crue-Esque 'D--kheads';He thinks they were given a bad boy reputation.;"Over the last decade and a half, Bring Me the Horizon have cemented themselves as a household name within the heavy music community, but they weren't always so well-respected. Oli Sykes recalled that when the band was first gaining popularity, they were portrayed ""as a Motley Crue-esque bunch of fucking dickheads.""The discussion came up in a reflective interview with Kerrang!, where Sykes explained that BMTH were depicted negatively by the media — even though he felt they didn't deserve such a regard.“Our band was kind of branded as a Mötley Crüe-esque bunch of fucking dickheads,” the frontman declared. ""One of the first interviews I did, the guy twisted every single word. Things that were said as a joke were put like I was saying it angrily, and it was just a massive shock to me that we were portrayed as these people. I thought I was a nice guy, and there were all these magazines that said I wasn’t. It was amazing just how your words could be twisted into something you didn’t mean, and I struggled with that.""Sykes added that he became a polarizing figure as a result of the reputation.“People either painted me as an idol or I was fucking hated. You’re the guy on the cover and it’s Photoshopped and put in the best light, but you can never look like that. And you’re also not this horrible, evil person, you’re just a regular person that makes mistakes like everyone else – but no one thinks you’re a regular person. You’re either a c--t or a god. It’s quite a headfuck.”Despite the criticism the band endured in its early years, the vocalist admitted he actually feels bad for new artists that are trying to establish themselves now, especially because of the role that social media plays in someone's success.“Most labels want you to do skits for TikTok, or be thinking about your social media presence, and that alone is a full-time gig. I can’t imagine what it would be like to be a new artist and have that responsibility,"" Sykes said. ""It’s not just making music, you’ve also got to be an actor, almost. I’m watching it with my wife [Alissic] now, and it’s mad.”Bring Me the Horizon will spend the summer touring throughout Europe, then they'll head over to North American for a fall tour, which kicks off with a performance at the Louder Than Life festival in September. Knocked Loose, grandson and Siiickbrain will join them as openers throughout the run.

Loudwire;Poll: What's the Best Led Zeppelin Album? - Vote Now;To be a rock and not to roll.;Led Zeppelin are often regarded as one of the most important bands in both rock 'n' roll and metal history. They were on top of the world throughout much of the late '60s and '70s, and released eight studio albums during their reign. But which of their records is the best? That's what we want to hear from you in this week's Loudwire Nights Album of the Week poll.You'll have until Friday at 12N ET to cast your votes. We’ll then play the three tracks from the album with the most votes during Loudwire Nights' Album of the Week block to start the following Monday's show!Led Zeppelin's cocktail of the blues and heavy, distorted rock 'n' roll often gives them recognition as one of the very first true heavy metal bands along with Black Sabbath and Cream. Over the course of their career, which lasted about 12 years, they became one of the most massive artists on the planet. From their 1969 eponymous debut to their eighth and final record In Through the Out Door, Robert Plant's distinct screeching vocals, Jimmy Page's innovative riffs and the thunderous rhythm of both John Paul Jones and John Bonham made them one of the most influential musical groups of all time.All eight of their studio albums have been certified platinum multiple times, four of which have actually reached the diamond status (Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin IV, Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti). But, in 1980, they called it quits when Bonham unexpectedly died at the age of 32 years old. Plant, Page and Jones have reunited several times since then, but they rarely went by the Led Zeppelin name, except for when Jason Bonham filled in for his late father.All four musicians were experts in their craft, and have been major sources of inspiration for generations of rock stars that followed. We'll likely never get another Led Zeppelin album and probably won't ever see them take the stage together again, but they left behind a legacy that'll never fade.Head below to vote for your favorite Led Zeppelin album, then tune into Loudwire Nights next Monday at 7PM ET to find out which record prevailed. During tonight's show, you'll get to find out which Foo Fighters album was voted the best, and hear three songs from the winner.Loudwire Nights with Toni Gonzalez airs nightly starting at 7PM ET.

Loudwire;Guns N' Roses Soundcheck Previously Unreleased 'Chinese Democracy' Era Song in Tel Aviv;Could we soon be getting a setlist addition?;"Guns N' Roses certainly are shaking up the setlist on their recently launched tour, having previously played rarities ""Bad Obsession,"" ""Pretty Tied Up,"" their ""Down on the Farm"" cover"" and ""Anything Goes"" during their tour kickoff in Abu Dhabi earlier this month. And the mining of their back catalog may not stop there, as fans outside the venue at their June 5 show in Tel Aviv caught the band soundchecking the song ""Perhaps.""For those who need a refresher, while it was not included on the final album, ""Perhaps"" was one of the songs that was in consideration during the band's Chinese Democracy album. And per Setlist.fm, it was one of several songs the band ran through ahead of their performance, with others being ""It's So Easy,"" plus the recently added ""Bad Obsession,"" ""Pretty Tied Up,"" ""Anything Goes"" and ""Down on the Farm"" as well. While each of the other soundcheck songs made their way into the set, ""Perhaps"" was left out, perhaps in need of a little more polishing first.Get Guns N' Roses Tickets HereIt's not been unusual for GN'R to use their soundchecks to warm up to eventually placing new music in their sets, having previously done so for ""Hard Skool"" and ""Absurd"" in the past. But for now, the fan-recorded snippets of ""Perhaps"" from the Tel Aviv soundcheck can be heard below.As for that Tel Aviv show, the Times Of Israel reports that the band played to a sold-out, 60,000 person crowd at Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park. This marked six years since their last appearance in Israel, and their fourth show in the country since they first played there back in 1993.READ MORE: Guns N' Roses Confirm Support Acts, Add Dates to 2023 U.S. TourThe 27-song set also included the Duff McKagan-led Stooges cover of ""T.V.

Ed Sheeran says he's been a fan of the band for some time now.""We're going to write a song together...playing with Bring Me the Horizon was a dream. I got in touch with Oli and we were going to write together but then the pandemic happened so we're in touch - I've been a fan for a long time.""The pop singer reached out to Oli Sykes about performing together at the 2022 Brit Awards and it all came together within a couple of weeks.""Oddly enough that's the kind of music I grew up listening to and had a Kerrang subscription and I listened to it constantly,"" said Sheeran.The pop star has opened up about his love for metal before. Last summer he told The Sun that he was ""really into death metal as a kid"" and ""listened to Cradle of Filth and Slipknot and all that stuff."" And after Cradle of Filth's Dani Filth heard this, he reached out for a possible collaboration with Ed Sheeran, which he says would be fun.Ed Sheeran is always down to collab and it seems like both his and Bring Me the Horizon's sounds are both constantly evolving.

Loudwire;Hayley Williams Calls Out Fat Mike's Past Comments About Her - 'I Do Not Think That's Punk';The Paramore singer also addresses the emo nostalgia craze.;"In a new interview, Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams pressed back on the emo nostalgia craze and suggested that the early punk scene she came up in wasn't all it was cracked up to be.Remembering the era from what she experienced, the Paramore vocalist also discussed suggestive onstage comments that she said were once made by NOFX bandleader ""Fat"" Mike Burkett.When Paramore played the nostalgia-driven music festival When We Were Young this past October, as Billboard pointed out, Williams told the crowd that the scene had not always been a safe place ""if you were different, if you were a young woman, if you were a person of color, if you were queer. And that's really fucked up if you think about it, because this was supposed to be the safe place, wasn't it?""She shared similar thoughts in a letter before the fest. In the past, Burkett has come under fire for onstage banter. NOFX once apologized for onstage comments.""We don't want to be a nostalgia band,"" William tells Billboard now. ""But I think what I felt was a mixture of vindication and also a lot of anger. I was really surprised that I had so much anger well up in me because I was like, 'Wait a minute. They're treating us like a prize now.'""She adds, ""But like, Fat Mike used to tell people that I gave good rim jobs onstage when I was 19 years old. I do not think that that's punk. I don't think that's the essence of punk. And I feel strongly that without young women, people of color and also the queer community, I just think we would still be where we were then.""For listeners ""trying to remember better days … I'm sitting there like, 'They weren't that much better,'"" Williams says. Going forward, she explained she feels the scene's importance lies in the fans that made the music such a movement in the first place.""We hung out with My Chem[ical Romance] a few minutes before we went on the last weekend [at When We Were Young 2022], and I think they feel very similarly about how they were received. What it comes down to is that the fans are the ones with the power because otherwise, us and My Chem wouldn't have been headlining that thing.

Loudwire;13 Rock + Metal Songs Written In Tribute To Late Musicians;Death can provide inspiration.;"The music business is not nearly as dark as it might seem on the surface. While there are some artists that can grow jaded as the years go on, musicians still have a heart, and it grows that much more heavy when they see their fellow musicians pass away. As such, it's not uncommon for the deaths of peers to inspire musicians to share their grief through song.Although not all of these songs tackle death in the same way, you can hear the musicians wrestling with their emotions and trying their best to move on after losing some of the most important people in their lives. It might not be easy, but these are the kind of songs that are more than just notes on a page. These tracks are what help musicians and fans move on from tragedy.Check out these 13 Rock + Metal Songs Written in Tribute to Late Musicians below.""Friend of a Friend"" Foo Fighters Tribute to Kurt CobainAfter Kurt Cobain’s tragic passing it would be totally understandable for Dave Grohl to never pick up an instrument again. When he started to soldier on with the Foo Fighters though, it felt like Dave was using it as a way to move on from his trauma.With years under his belt, “Friend of a Friend” from 2005’s In Your Honor is one of the few songs where Dave opens up about Kurt, talking about the old days when they were sharing an apartment together when Nirvana were first getting big. A decade had gone by since Kurt’s passing at this point, and just hearing Dave and a guitar gives us a little peek behind the curtain, as if we’re a fly on the wall in those early pre-“Teen Spirit” days. For all of the manic screams Kurt gave us on Nirvana records, this is a look at the gentler side of him we didn’t see too often.""Aesthetics of Hate""Machine Head Tribute to Dimebag DarrellWhenever a giant passes away, there’s always going to be musicians willing to pay their due respects. When Dimebag Darrell passed away though, one journalist wasn’t so kind, making disparaging remarks about Darrell’s playing just a week after his murder. The metal community was never going to take kindly to that, let alone Robb Flynn from Machine Head.From the first few seconds that Flynn opens his mouth, he is ready for war, taking this critic to task for disrespecting one of the greatest players to ever pick up a guitar. While everyone’s entitled to their own opinion, “Aesthetics of Hate” is about a manner of respecting those who have passed on. Everyone can be a critic sometimes, but in the house of Machine Head, no blasphemy of Dime is going to be tolerated.""Goodbye""Slipknot Tribute to Paul GrayThroughout Slipknot’s career, the 9 have always acted like metal brothers in arms. And when bassist Paul Gray passed away from a drug overdose in 2009, there was no way the band was going to sidestep the issue, dedicating their entire next album to Paul’s memory.While the shadow of Gray’s memory looms large over most of .5 The Gray Chapter, “Goodbye” is when the lyrics get a lot more personal. In just over two minutes, Corey Taylor is really wearing his heart on his sleeve. The only way to get through that darkness is acceptance, though, and the Knot were able to move on and become stronger people with this song, paying tribute to the crazy mother****** who kept the good times rolling through the years.""White Lightning""Def Leppard Tribute to Steve ClarkAt the height of their fame in the ‘80s, it almost felt like Def Leppard were cursed to some extent. While they notched up hit after hit, they had to deal with production struggles on 1987’s Hysteria with the absence of Mutt Lange, record executives constantly asking about when the album would be due for release, and even soldiering on after drummer Rick Allen lost his arm in a car accident midway through the production.Then again, nothing cut deeper than losing guitarist Steve Clark to drug abuse in 1990, and the band finished off the recording of their next album, Adrenalize, with “White Lightning” acting as an epic in Steve’s memory. With the title taken from a nickname Steve had while on the road, Phil Collen had even mentioned the spookiness of recording the album after his passing, almost like having the ghost of Steve by his side as he was playing his parts. Because even if Steve wasn’t there in the studio anymore, his presence was still tied up in between this recording.""To Live Is To Die""Metallica Tribute to Cliff BurtonMany of us would-be musicians can only dream of doing half of what Cliff Burton did before his passing. It looked like Burton was going to be one of the most accomplished bass players of all time, before a tragic bus accident on Metallica’s ""Master of Puppets"" tour in 1986 brought everything to a halt.And as much as …And Justice for All gets a lot of flak for having the bass mixed fairly low throughout the entire record, “To Live Is To Die” is a touching tribute to Cliff, where the band makes an instrumental featuring some of the final lines that Cliff ever wrote spoken by James Hetfield at the tail end of the song. Listening to this song almost feels like you’re seeing the band deal with his death in real time, from the sad midsection being a depiction of the accident and spending the rest of the song coming to terms with what they just experienced.It was going to be a long road back to normal, but these were the steps that Metallica needed to take to carry on.""in My Darkest Hour""Megadeth Tribute to Cliff BurtonWhile we’re on the topic of Cliff, Metallica weren’t the only ones left grieving over his passing. Across the world, Dave Mustaine ended up hearing the news of Cliff’s death relayed to him second hand by Maria Ferrero from Megaforce Records. Needing to vent out his frustration somewhere, Dave came up with “In My Darkest Hour,” which works as both a ballad to Cliff and a way for Dave to work through his only feelings about it.Though it has been described as a breakup song by Mustaine, you can still feel that initial spark from hearing about Cliff’s passing, almost acting as another shade of black to Dave’s sadness. While this is a lot softer than most Megadeth songs, it never loses the edge that makes it a metal song either. Cliff was always a fan of heavy music, and this is the kind of epic sendoff that he deserved.""Tearjerker""Red Hot Chili Peppers Tribute to Kurt CobainThroughout the Chili Peppers’ career, Anthony Kiedis was never shy about opening up about the dark side of life. And when the band had to soldier on without John Frusciante in the guitarists’ slot, things were getting a lot more depressing, with later songs like “Warped” off of One Hot Minute in 1995 alluding to Anthony Kiedis relapsing on hard drugs. While the rest of the album had a dark streak, there’s a beautiful ballad buried underneath everything in “Tearjerker,” which was written in tribute to Kurt Cobain.Since Anthony Kiedis had known Kurt from Nirvana opening the ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" tour, this is the kind of song that feels like an outsider looking in. Anthony had said that he never got to know Kurt personally on the tour, but always thought of him as a gentle soul and was in awe of his music despite how much darkness was tied up in his story. Some songs might act as a eulogy for musicians, but this song feels more like a celebration of life.""So Far Away""Avenged Sevenfold Tribute to The RevIn the wake of Jimmy “The Rev” Sullivan’s death, Synyster Gates said that Avenged Sevenfold spent a week wondering whether they should even continue on. These guys were musical brothers, and losing one of their own was going to leave a gaping hole in their sound. In the final days of recording Nightmare, “So Far Away” was made in memory of Jimmy, with lyrics that are enough to leave any listener in shambles.Though most of the record was well into production before Jimmy's death, this is where everyone starts to process the loss of their musical brother in song. Instead of being angry or bitter over his musical brother passing on, this is a way for M Shadows to look back and think of all the things that he could say to Jimmy but doesn’t have the chance. While the band did have the intent of making a concept record with Nightmare, things really shifted focus after The Rev’s passing, and you can still feel his spirit onstage whenever they play this song.""Say Hello 2 Heaven""Temple of the Dog Tribute to Andy WoodWhereas some supergroups come together for the fun of it, Temple of the Dog was one of the purest collaborations ever made. After rooming with Andy Wood of Mother Love Bone in the early days of grunge, Chris Cornell of Soundgarden was shattered when he heard of Wood’s passing midway through a tour.While he didn’t anticipate his tribute songs being an album at first, “Say Hello 2 Heaven” is the kind of hard rocking slow burn where you can feel every bit of emotion dripping out of his voice. After drafting in Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament in tow to help fill out the record, this is Cornell pouring his heart out for his fallen friend, with the rest of his grunge brethren standing right by his side. The Seattle scene was always a tight knit community, and this was a time to grieve and heal those raw nerves.""Never Fade""Alice in Chains Tribute to Chris Cornell + Layne StaleyThe entire Seattle scene has had to deal with its fair share of darkness. Even before Kurt Cobain’s death, Alice in Chains already had their fair share of turmoil, as Layne Staley struggled with heroin addiction throughout most of the band’s run. Though they managed to document their substance abuse on Dirt, the band reached its tragic end when Staley succumbed to an overdose in 2002.While Jerry Cantrell managed to soldier on by sharing harmonies with William DuVall, Alice hadn’t forgotten where they came from, as “Never Fade” pays tribute to Layne as well as Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, who died the year before the record was due for release. While the eeriness of Alice’s sound is still accounted for, the message behind this song is a lot more wholesome. Just because their friends might be gone doesn’t mean they’ve been forgotten, and we will be remembering these fallen icons for years to come.""Above and Beyond""Deep Purple Tribute to Jon LordWhen Deep Purple were told that their beloved keyboardist Jon Lord had passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2012, it was a heavy blow. While Lord had stepped away from the band all the way back in 2002, his keyboard lines are still some of the most untouchable riffs in the world of hard rock, guitar or otherwise.His spirit lived on in Purple’s music even without him there, and Ian Gillan wanted to pay his due respects in song on Now What?! In 2013. For “Above and Beyond,” Gillan wrote the lyric “your souls had been touched are forever entwined” specifically in tribute to Jon’s memory. Purple had certainly moved on since Jon’s departure with Don Airey assuming the keyboard throne, but if you look at these lines, the impact Jon had on the band is stronger than even mortality.""Life Wasted""Pearl Jam Tribute to Johnny RamoneAs grunge started to flood the airwaves in the early ‘90s, rock fans certainly got a reality check with subjects of mortality. Alice in Chains had already mentioned the horrors of substance abuse, and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam was no stranger to a bit of darkness either, like covering teen suicide on “Jeremy” on their debut album Ten. You get a lot more perspective on death as you grow up though, and Eddie seemed prepared to take on the passing of a dear friend on the track “Life Wasted.”Written as a tribute to Johnny Ramone, the lyrics are a lot more optimistic than most tribute songs, seeing death as an opportunity to cherish the moments that you have while you’re still here. By PJ standards, Eddie basically wrote his own version of a Ramones song here, sticking to the straight ahead rhythm and power chords that smack you in the face from the minute they start. Much like the classic Ramones tracks he loved, Eddie learned one important lesson: there’s no time to screw around, so you might as well get to the point.""Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do""Van Halen Tribute to Kurt CobainIt could not have been easy for Kurt Cobain to deal with the pressure of being the voice of grunge. Fame can be a tricky tightrope to walk, let alone for someone like Kurt who had openly dismissed his own masterpiece Nevermind in the press.When the darkness got the better of him back in 1994, Van Halen's Sammy Hagar was really affected by it and wanted to say his piece about anyone who might be dealing with the same struggle that Kurt had. While “Don’t Tell Me What Love Can Do” was reworked in the recording process to be a lot less specific, the message of pushing on when times are tough were untouched. Even though Kurt’s demons become too much for him to bear, that doesn’t mean that we have to live the rest of our lives in the shadows as well.Rockers We've Lost in 2022Rock + Metal Musicians Who Died in 2022";2022-05-30;https://loudwire.com/rock-metal-songs-tribute-late-musicians/;2022-06-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE13ROCK+METALSONGSWRITTENINTRIBUTETOLATEMUSICIANS
Loudwire;Axl Rose Addresses Health Issues, Working With Vocal Coach;Well wishes!;"Following Guns N' Roses' cancelation of their Glasgow performance earlier this week, frontman Axl Rose has addressed his health issues in a statement on his social media, adding that he's been working with a vocal coach as he recovers.The band played two consecutive shows in Tottenham, England, on July 1 and 2, and during the second night, the singer admitted to the crowd that he was struggling a bit and had slept in the stadium the night before rather than their hotel.

Loudwire;Chad Smith Laments Participation in Interview About Taylor Hawkins in New Statement;He says the Rolling Stone feature was 'sensationalized.';"Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith has issued a clarifying statement in the wake of a Rolling Stone story on Taylor Hawkins that emerged Monday (May 16). In the article, friends and collaborators of the late Foo Fighters drummer claimed he was unhappy with the Dave Grohl-led rock band's touring schedule and wanted to ease back.The release of Smith's statement on Tuesday (May 17), which expresses regret for granting the interview and a misunderstanding about the long-running music outlet's overall intentions, echoes the one released the same day by Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron, who also lamented his participation in the feature.""Taylor was one of my best friends and I would do anything for his family,"" Smith says on social media. ""I was asked by Rolling Stone to share some memories of our time together, which I thought was going to be the loving tribute he deserved. Instead, the story they wrote was sensationalized and misleading, and had I known I never would have agreed to participate. I apologize to his family and musical friends for any pain this may have caused. I miss Taylor every day.""Chad Smith Statement - May 17, 2022Smith, Cameron and singer Sass Jordan (who worked with Hawkins in his early career) all shared similar recollections with Rolling Stone that Hawkins was having a difficult time keeping up with Foo Fighters' touring demands.""[Foo Fighters] is a big machine [with] a lot of people on the payroll. So you've got to really be cognizant of the business side of something when it's that big and that has inherent pressure,"" Cameron said after claiming Hawkins and Grohl had a ""heart-to-heart"" conversation about why the drummer said he ""couldn't fucking do it anymore.""""I guess they did come to some understanding,"" Cameron was quoted as saying, ""but it just seems like the touring schedule got even crazier after that. … He tried to keep up. He just did whatever it took to keep up, and in the end he couldn't keep up.""Jordan corroborated the notion and suggested Hawkins was ""tired of the whole game"" and ""finally spoke to Dave and really told him that he couldn't do this and that he wouldn't do it anymore.""Smith, meanwhile confirmed to Rolling Stone that it was Hawkins who was the then-unidentified member of Foos rushed to a Chicago hospital after boarding a flight last December.""He just said he was exhausted and collapsed, and they had to pump him full of IVs and stuff,"" Smith told the magazine. ""He was dehydrated and all kinds of stuff.""To Rolling Stone, a representative for Foo Fighters denied the story. ""No, there was never a 'heart-to-heart' — or any sort of meeting on this topic — with Dave and [Foo Fighters' management],"" they said. They added the plane incident was ""not true.""The cause of Hawkins' death is still unknown after he was found dead in Bogota, Colombia, on March 25, before Foos were to play Festival Estereo Picnic. A preliminary toxicology report suggested he had 10 different substances in his system when he died. Both Cameron and Smith paid tribute to him after his death. Cameron is currently out from touring with Pearl Jam after testing positive for COVID.In response to the publication of Rolling Stone's story, Cameron issued the statement seen below.Matt Cameron Statement - May 17, 2022Rockers We've Lost in 2022Rock + Metal Musicians Who Died in 2022";2022-05-18;https://loudwire.com/red-hot-chili-peppers-chad-smith-statement-taylor-hawkins-rolling-stone/;2022-05-18;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRECHADSMITHLAMENTSPARTICIPATIONININTERVIEWABOUTTAYLORHAWKINSINNEWSTATEMENT

That's why there's a deluxe edition of the record en route next month, complete with extra material including the band's newly released cover of Muse's ""Stockholm Syndrome.""It's a crushing cover, showcasing the heaviness of the original track while adding some of ERRA's own style and emphasis to the song.""The first time I heard Muse's 'Stockholm Syndrome,' I thought, 'This song is begging to be covered by a metal band,'"" shares guitarist and clean vocalist Jesse Cash about the impetus for choosing to interpret this song. ""It has aggressive riffs, soaring vocals, keyboard arpeggios, and a big ending breakdown. It has all the necessary materials to be contextualized into an ERRA song.""He continues, ""The chromatic guitar octaves in the verses also left me a lot of room to play with some chromatic groove riffs in the style of Meshuggah. I realized as long as I maintained the root notes of those original octaves, I could kind of be as creative as I wanted during those verses. I also adjusted the original tuning from Drop D to Drop E and tuned the guitar down an entire octave to make the song low, heavy and more akin to the range ERRA generally tunes in.""Below you'll find the new visualizer for the song, but just a head's up that those with photosensitive epilepsy might want to listen rather than watch in order to possibly avoid triggering a seizure.As for that new deluxe edition of the self-titled ERRA album, it's en route for a March 18 release. There are seven new tracks in total, including one, ""Vanish Canvas,"" that features a guest turn by Spiritbox's Courtney LaPlante.

Loudwire;Is Eddie Vedder's 'Brother the Cloud' About Chris Cornell?;There are a few different theories.;"Eddie Vedder's third solo record Earthling arrives later this week (Feb. 11). A few weeks ago, the Pearl Jam singer released the song ""Brother the Cloud,"" and its emotional lyrics discuss dealing with loss, which begs the question — was it written about Chris Cornell?Vedder and Cornell had a longstanding friendship that dates back to 1990 when the Soundgarden singer was working on an album called Temple of the Dog, which was a tribute to his late friend Andrew Wood. Vedder traveled from San Diego to Seattle to audition for a new group that Wood's Mother Love Bone bandmates were looking to start, as they were simultaneously working on the Temple album.The two vocalists struck a connection, and Vedder was invited to sing on ""Hunger Strike,"" one of the most successful tracks on the record.Temple of the Dog, ""Hunger Strike""Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, of course, went on to become two of the most successful rock bands to come out of Seattle in the 1990s, and Vedder and Cornell occasionally sang ""Hunger Strike"" live together in the following decades. That is, until Cornell died by suicide in May of 2017.Vedder didn't speak publicly about Cornell's death for a long time. In fact, he didn't really open up about the subject until an interview he did on The Howard Stern Show in late 2020.""I've had to be somewhat in denial,"" he admitted, noting that their bond wasn't only rooted in music. ""I was just terrified of where I would go if I allowed myself to feel what I needed to feel or what I was instinctively wanting to feel or how dark I felt like I was gonna go.""The lyrics could be about Cornell.The rocker released the song ""Brother the Cloud"" in January of this year, and the lyrics appear to highlight his feelings about the death of his friend — the opening verse reads, ""I had a brother / But now my brother is gone / Oh, I search the sky for a glimpse of his blue eyes / And there I find his image in the clouds,"" and the final lines repeat, ""What are friends for?""Reddit pages were flooded with speculation that the song is about Cornell soon after it was released. ""I feel like this is Eddie Vedder’s song for Chris Cornell, I miss him so much!"" one user wrote.Cornell had blue eyes, yes, but there's a bit more to the backstory than people may realize.Vedder endured another personal tragedy shortly beforehand.In the same discussion that Vedder had with Howard Stern, he also explained that in 2016, his biological brother Chris died during a climbing accident in Africa.""That one took me down so hard — and my brothers and my mom — I seriously didn't know if I was going to get out of that one,"" the singer recalled.This is a fact that many on Reddit are also pointing out, however, some listeners believe that the song may be about both losses.""I think the part near the end just completely gives it away like the other person said. I think what Ed was saying when he wrote, 'Put your arms around my brother my friend,' and the line before that as well, he was talking to his brother and Chris,"" a fan acknowledged.Further proof that the song was at least partly-inspired by Vedder's brother came from his wife Jill on Instagram. A photographer named Danny Clinch, who's acquainted with Vedder, posted about the song on his page, and Jill Vedder commented, ""Ed's little brother Chris is so missed by our family.""The pandemic caused a lot of loss for many. And, finally, in a new interview that the Pearl Jam leader did with Variety alongside producer Andrew Watt, a more general meaning was given to the song.""We’re in a time now of a lot of loss — this pandemic and saying goodbye to people. A lot of things have gone away from the way they were. People that were with you are not,"" Watt said. ""The song is a very honest display of that ambivalence, anger and sadness. The most important job I had was to shut my mouth and make sure the microphone was on so we didn’t miss a fuckin’ thing.”Ultimately, no one has given concrete confirmation that the song was written about Cornell, but there are plenty of reasons to believe that the late singer's death had an influence on it.

Now he's back for a second taste of this special record, dropping the video for his performance of ""Fly Me to the Moon.""They say it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing, and that's definitely the case as Sinatra's band members are in fine form bringing this classic to life with Tremonti's eerily close take on this Sinatra favorite. At the end of the clip, you can hear the words uttered, ""Sounds like a good one to me, that was poppin',"" which is a pretty accurate assessment of the performance.The song is the latest to arrive from Tremonti's Tremonti Sings Sinatra album that is part of his Take a Chance for Charity initiative. ""My biggest thing is to get Take a Chance for Charity happening,"" Tremonti told us in an interview last month. ""And this project was all done under the Take a Chance for Charity umbrella, which is an organization that I want to start that gets other musicians or athletes or actors or whoever has a fan base or platform to do something strange or outside of their comfort zone. It’s something their fan base would not know about. Maybe it’s some hidden passion that maybe people have always been nervous to put out there because it’s something different."" Learn more about Tremonti's goal with the initiative here.Within that initiative and the album release, all proceeds will go to support the NDSS (National Down Syndrome Society), a charity that Tremonti has become very familiar with as his daughter Stella has Down Syndrome. ""It’s my new life’s purpose do as much as I can to raise money for Down Syndrome,"" said Tremonti in the same interview.The 14-track Tremonti Sings Sinatra is scheduled for release on May 27 and pre-orders are available here. In addition to the album release, Tremonti and members of Sinatra's orchestra will perform at a sold out charity benefit in Orlando, Florida at the Abbey on May 14.Mark Tremonti, ""Fly Me to the Moon""The 40 Best Cover Songs by 40 Rock Bands";2022-04-22;https://loudwire.com/mark-tremonti-frank-sinatra-band-fly-me-to-the-moon-video/;2022-04-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREMARKTREMONTISWINGSWITHFRANKSINATRABANDMEMBERSININFINITELYCOOL'FLYMETOTHEMOON'VIDEO

In the clip, the rock singer initially refuses the autograph, expressing his concern about professional autograph dealers who only grab celebrity signatures to sell them.

(Out of the Vein is Third Eye Blind's 2003 studio album.

Loudwire;Hear a Chaotic Bluegrass Version of System of a Down's 'Chop Suey';Wake up ... with a banjo, mandolin, cello and guitar.;"Wake up! It's time to give System of a Down's ""Chop Suey"" a little shakeup, and bluegrass outfit The Dead South are just the band to do it.The band has a two-part covers EP en route with their take on the System of a Down classic turning up as a pivotal piece in the second part of their Easy Listening for Jerks sets. While you've heard the song many times prior, it takes on a different feel with the plucking banjo, mandolin, cello and guitar. But, as seen in the video below, just because it's bluegrass doesn't mean it's any less chaotic.For their covers sets, the band shows off some of their folk influences on Easy Listening for Jerks, Part I and gives them a more contemporary edge, while the second set of covers leans heavier taking influence from the band's own pre-show playlist. ""Chop Suey"" lines up with covers from CKY, Misfits, The Doors and more on Easy Listening for Jerks, Part II.If you like what you hear, both covers EPs are set for release tomorrow (March 4) and you can pick up Part I here and Part !! here. And if you want to check out other cool, weird and wild covers of ""Chop Suey,"" head here.Having sparked initial interest through YouTube, the foursome have since graduated to club shows and larger venues. The band has a few dates in the U.K. and France over the next two months before venturing stateside.

Loudwire;Artist Creates Creepy But Cool Taylor Momsen Bedding Set;Take a look.;"An artist has created a creepy yet cool bedding set with Taylor Momsen's face all over it. This could take your obsession with The Pretty Reckless to a whole new level.Taylor Momsen recently reposted some of the amazing artwork on her Instagram account, featuring the bedding set completely covered with eerie images of her. The bedspread is a huge sinister-looking portrait of her with her signature black eye makeup and eyes that look as if they're whited out and rolled back. There are also three pillows in the bedding set, all complete with more Momsen imagery.One of the pillows features the singer with a large cross neckless, standing in front of a brick wall. Another shows her holding her black guitar. In an interview with Total Guitar Magazine, Momsen revealed her guitar's name is the Punisher and is a specific Fender Telecaster custom with two DiMarzio Super Distortion humbuckers. The last pillow shows Taylor Momsen bent over with part of her garter belt straps showing a heart on her back.The artist, who's name is Lucas David, specializes in portraits of musicians and celebrities and he has created portraits of Tatu, Lindsay Lohan, Emma Roberts, Megan Fox and more.This Taylor Momsen-covered bedding set isn't the first time he's worked with The Pretty Reckless. David also illustrated the ""Death By Rock And Roll"" lyric video in 2020, which you can see below, and he has created portraits of Taylor Momsen prior to that.We didn't find the bedding set for sale on Lucas David's website, but who knows, maybe you'll be able to cuddle up and sleep with Momsen soon.Here's a look at the creepy but cool bedding set featuring Momsen below.

Loudwire;Mick Jagger Gets Flashed at Concert, So He Flashes Back;It's a gas, gas, gas!;"Mick Jagger has likely seen it all, performing onstage with the Rolling Stones, so when he recently spotting a topless woman flashing him in the crowd at the band's Tuesday show (Aug. 2) in Spain, he was ready with his response, flashing her right back.The band was in the midst of performing ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" when the incident occurred (sadly, they were not playing ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"") as footage shared by the New York Post shows.As seen in the video at the bottom of this post, the woman filmed from behind clearly is without her shirt as she waves an American flag and bounces on a fellow concertgoer's shoulders to the song. As Jagger traipses across the stage he eventually spots the woman in the crowd, then briefly lifting his own shirt to bare his nipples to her as well, all while not missing a beat in his performance. As the video concludes, the woman then starts to put her shirt back on.Jagger had briefly posted the footage to his Instagram account, before it was shared by the Post.The Rolling Stones are currently touring as part of their 60th anniversary. The band returned to the road shortly after the death of drummer Charlie Watts last year.

Loudwire;How Did Disturbed's David Draiman Lose All That Weight? - He Explains;Will you get down with the fitness, too?;"Over the last few months, Disturbed singer David Draiman has been commenting on his weight loss journey, then confirming earlier this week that he's now down to 180 pounds, dropping 34 pounds since he started trying to shed the lbs back in January.The singer posted a photo along with his weight-loss update, showing his svelte and lean transition while achieving a weight he says he hasn't maintained since the mid-2000s. He added that he's now ""in shape to kick everyone's asses this summer."" So how did Draiman do it? He's now shared his weight loss routine through Twitter, serving up some helpful tips for those also looking to shed some weight.In a Twitter thread, the musician starts, ""Lots of people have been asking about what I did to lose the weight."" He then details six key tips that helped him get to the place he's at now.First up, ""Since I have severe acid reflux disease, I can’t eat 4 hours prior to performing and 2 hours prior to sleeping, so my last meal on show days is usually a late lunch, so intermittent fasting becomes the norm,"" he explained.He adds, ""I avoid fried foods, caffeine, chocolate, overly spicy foods and try to eat as cleanly as I can out on the road."" That can be a challenge given travel times and availability, but Draiman has been up to the challenge.The musician adds, ""I workout 3-4 days a week, isolate muscle groups, muscle confusion, HIIT training for cardio, use a couple apps I can use anywhere when there’s no gym nearby.""The fourth tip may be a little harder for non-musicians, with Draiman noting, ""I easily burn 500-750 calories each time we play a show."" While not everyone has the live show platform to burn off those calories, there are likely other exercise alternatives that could get you something close.He also shares with a laugh, ""I drink more water in a day than the average person does in a week,"" but, drinking water instead of soft drinks and caffeinated beverages does help.And his final tip is to ""avoid yogurt, and flax seed (testosterone inhibitors), only eat eggs when poached or boiled."" ""There you have it,"" says the singer. Down with the fitness, indeed!So look for the leaner David Draiman onstage this summer, as Disturbed continue promotion of their Divisive album. Shows are coming up in Denver (July 11), Salt Lake City (July 13) and Ridgefield and Auburn, Washington (July 15 and 16) next week.READ MORE: David Draiman Responds to Fans After Opening Up About Mental HealthSubscribe to the Loudwire newsletter and download the Loudwire app to stay up on the latest rock and metal news.The Songs 30 Huge Rock + Metal Bands Only Played Live OnceNote: songs that were played as part of a medley and cover songs were not considered for this list.

Loudwire;The Killers Stop Show to Make Sure Older Crowd Surfer Is Okay;'Billy the Crowd Surfer' is reportedly 67.;"The Killers paused a performance last week in Manchester, England, after bandleader Brandon Flowers spotted an older crowd surfer who had injured his head in the audience.Video of the subsequent exchange between the musician and the concertgoer, called Billy by the singer, has now gone viral, as shown this week by Consequence and Stereogum.Billy received chants in his name from the audience after Flowers returned to the stage to explain what had happened. In the British press the following day, the crowd surfer was identified only as 67-year-old ""Billy the Crowd Surfer,"" although The Killers singer initially guessed he was just slightly older. (via Radio X)Watch the video down toward the bottom of this post.""Who dropped him?"" Flowers asks the audience in fan-captured footage of the incident last Saturday (June 11). ""Come on — is he okay? It's okay — oh, his head's bleeding a little bit.

""Billy was trying to crowd surf,"" Flowers jovially reported back to the crowd. He looks like he's about 68 or 69.""Relaying the pair's brief exchange, Flowers adds, ""Billy, what are you doing?

Loudwire;33 Years Ago: Motley Crue Release 'Dr. Feelgood';Mötley Crüe were unapologetically obsessed with crafting the kind of sticky, sleazy hard rock that defined MTV hair metal.;"Five albums into their career, Mötley Crüe were unapologetically obsessed with crafting the kind of sticky, sleazy hard rock that defined MTV hair metal and hooked the masses like steaming bowls of salty buttered popcorn. Dr. Feelgood, which came out Sept. 1, 1989, was basically the Crüe’s take on Aerosmith-style stadium rock. The album, which was performed with inexhaustible energy and brimmed over with giant-sized hooks, even featured Aerosmith vocalist Steven Tyler in “Sticky Sweet” and the intro to “Slice of Your Pie.”""Nikki and Tommy and I hung out a lot,"" Tyler told Rolling Stone. “Of course, we're all akin by our old drinking and drugging days.”Motley Crue, ""Dr. Feelgood""Nikki Sixx wrote most of the songs for Dr. Feelgood after going through rehab and getting clean and sober, and tracks like “Dr. Feelgood” (about dope dealers who provide the perfect fix) and “Kickstart My Heart” (which Sixx wrote after surviving an overdose) are perfect examples of an artist writing about what he knows. “Slice of Pie” and “She Goes Down” exposed the other side of the debauchery-fueled Mötley playbook. But Dr. Feelgood isn’t just a filth-fueled recipe for a raging party, it’s full of the band’s most focused material and loaded with choruses as infectious as an STD.“In rehab they told me that the only way to get clean is by believing in and seeking the help of a higher power that could return sanity to my life,” Sixx wrote in The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Rock Band. “Most people chose God or love. I chose the only woman who hadn’t abandoned me my whole life: Music. And it was time to pay her back for her faith and perseverance.”Other standout tracks on Dr. Feelgood include ""Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)"" and “Same Ol' Situation,” which features backup vocals by Night Ranger’s Jack Blades. ""That was about a girl leaving a guy for a girl,” Sixx told Rolling Stone. “The subject plagues men worldwide. I love it because when [our label] Elektra heard it they were like, 'Oh, this is perfect for a single.' In Mötley fashion, we were like, 'Wonderful. We'll tell you later that it's about lesbians.'""Motley Crue, ""Same Old Situation""Producer Bob Rock’s production played a large role in the enjoyability of Dr. Feelgood. Instead of giving the band a glammy sheen, as Tom Werman did on Theatre of Pain and Girls, Girls, Girls, Rock EQ’d the guitars with ample low-end and plenty of midrange so even the sing-songy numbers sounded gritty. And the band weren’t afraid to compliment boozy, blues-inspired numbers with syrupy ballads like “Without You” and “Don’t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away).”""That's a great song,” Neil said. “I love to play guitar and sing that song. It's kind of a feel-good song. When that song comes on everybody wants to sing along with you.”Motley Crue, ""Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)""Since Mötley Crüe didn’t always get along, even when they were sober, Rock encouraged them to record their parts at separate times when they entered Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia in mid-1989. Whether Rock’s plan strengthened the record or the musicians just had more ability to concentrate than they did when back when they were all raging drunk or high all the time, Dr. Feelgood is Mötley Crüe’s most consistent album, and one that at least sounds like it was a blast to make. In addition to the guest appearances by Roth and Blades, Bryan Adams, Cheap Trick’s vocalist Robin Zander and guitarist Rick Nielsen and members of Skid Row all contributed backing vocals.Dr. Feelgood entered the Billboard album chart at No. 1 and sold more than six million copies in the U.S. alone. The album won Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal album of the Year at the 1991 American Music Awards and the title track and “Kickstart My Heart” were nominated for Grammy awards for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Both times the Crüe lost to Living Colour, first against the song “Cult of Personality,” then against “Time’s Up.”Motley Crue, ""Kickstart My Heart""Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;Bruce Dickinson Doesn't Want Iron Maiden in the Rock Hall - 'We're Not Dead Yet';He makes some good points.;"Of all the artists who’ve yet to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Iron Maiden’s repeated snubbing may be the most egregious and contentious. According to frontman Bruce Dickinson, though, fans shouldn’t feel too bad about it since he doesn’t even want the designation anyway.Speaking to The Telegraph in between shows in Prague late last month (but published on June 16), Dickinson didn’t sugarcoat his response to the fact that Iron Maiden weren’t one of the 2023 Rock Hall inductees:We don’t give a monkey’s [ass] because the people that get us are not the people that run the music business establishment, whatever that is, because that is largely run by people that can’t make a living doing anything else. I don’t want to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! Because we’re not dead yet! Some people feel almost actively threatened by metal. Not by the nature of the music. But by the fact that it doesn’t conform to their worldview of what pop music should be, which is: pop music is disposable, darling. Well: we don’t make disposable pop music.Although they’ve been eligible since 2004, Iron Maiden have only been nominated twice: in 2021 and 2023. Naturally, fans – as well as industry writers and fellow rockers – immediately voiced their disapproval of the choice to reject Iron Maiden (and Soundgarden) once again.Meanwhile, Rock Hall CEO Greg Harris explained to Audacy Check-In in May 2023: “We love that people . . . care if [Iron Maiden are] in or out, and that their fans care. The truth is anybody that’s nominated, the odds are good that they’ll eventually gonna get in. In fact, I think it may be as high as 90 percent eventually go in."" Specifically, Harris continued, it took Rage Against the Machine about half a dozen attempts before they were inducted this year, “so sometimes it takes a while.”At the time, we asked ChatGPT to describe why Iron Maiden weren’t included, to which it responded: “The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has strict criteria for inductees, and the selection process is highly competitive. . . . It is worth noting, however, that induction into the Hall of Fame is not necessarily a reflection of an artist's talent, influence, or popularity, but rather a complex combination of various factors, including the opinions and decisions of the Hall's voting members.""READ MORE: The Super Deep Cut Iron Maiden's Steve Harris Really Wants to Play LiveIt's not like this is the first time Dickinson has rebuked the Rock Hall, either. Back in 2018, he told The Jerusalem Post that he “would never want to be there. If we’re ever inducted, I will refuse – they won’t bloody be having my corpse in there.” Clearly, his newest views are consistent with his past ones.Plus, Iron Maiden haven’t exactly been wallowing in self-pity. Instead, they’ve been kicking butt on the Future Past tour, where they played “Alexander the Great” for the first time ever. They’ve now also got their own Monopoly game, “Monopoly: Iron Maiden Somewhere on Tour”!So, how do you feel about Dickinson’s recent comments?

Loudwire;Matt Skiba Reveals 'Almost a Whole Album's Worth of Stuff' Was Written With Blink-182;The former Blink-182 member reveals the presence of unreleased music from his time in the band.;"Tom DeLonge is back in Blink-182 and Matt Skiba, who filled in admirably over the last seven years, has now taken a step back from the group. But in a new interview, Skiba reveals that he was quite far along with Blink-182 on material for a new album that may or may not see the light of day.Recently speaking with Vulture, Skiba confirmed the presence of unreleased songs from his time within the group. ""I don't know if they'll come out,"" said the singer-guitarist. ""I think they're really good.""""There’s almost a whole album’s worth of stuff,"" he then added. ""It was supposed to be an EP, and it just kept going, and going. And now we have, I don’t know if they’re just going to get scrapped, but there’s eight or nine brand-new songs that are done. We basically finished those, and then Mark was diagnosed, if I’m getting the timeline correct.""Skiba is of course talking about co-vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus, who underwent treatment for cancer during the late spring and summer of 2021. It was during that period that Hoppus and DeLonge reconnected on a more significant level, with DeLonge declaring in September of last year that they had ""completely repaired"" their friendship.Further discussing the work he'd already done with Blink, Skiba stated, ""I hadn’t even thought about those recordings. But I have them. They’re good songs. I’ll keep them a secret. I’ll keep them safe forever. But we’ll see. I don’t know, maybe they’re something that we could open up and look at differently, or it’s something that’ll come out later, I have no idea.""Within the same interview, Skiba reiterated that he was glad to see DeLonge return to the band. He initially posted after DeLonge's return was announced, ""I am truly grateful for my time with blink and I am truly happy you guys are a band and a family again.""In the Vulture interview, he elaborated, ""I really am genuinely glad, as a fan of the band, that they’re a family again. It seems like people are really psyched about it, and I’m one of those people too. I’m honored to have been asked to fill in for Tom or to join the band or however you want to phrase it. I’m proud of the work that I did with them. We had a great time... There’s no bad blood, there’s no drama, there’s no nothing. It’s just the next chapter in the band’s life.""During his time in the band, Skiba appeared on the California and Nine albums, and there's always the possibility that the now shelved material could eventually surface when the time is right.The move hasn't left Skiba without work, as his long-running band Alkaline Trio have several dates surrounding their When We Were Young festival appearances.

Loudwire;The Mars Volta Debuted New Songs + Played Many Classics at First Show Since 2012;The Texas troupe performed several tracks for the first time!;It’s been over a decade since prog/jazz/psych rock masters The Mars Volta put out a new album – 2012’s Noctourniquet – and embarked on a subsequent tour. Thus, this past Thursday’s (Sept. 22) first show in support of their recently released self-titled LP was heavily anticipated, and gratefully, their setlist included a mix of old favorites and brand-new bangers.The concert took place at The Factory in Deep Ellum (in Dallas, Texas). Although it’s several hundred miles away from the band’s hometown of El Paso, Texas, it’s as close as they’ll come to playing a hometown show during their 2022 live trek.Naturally, they debuted a couple of songs from the critically acclaimed The Mars Volta – “Graveyard Love” and “Blacklight Sunshine” – yet the biggest surprise came when they opened with another never-before-played tune: “Vicarious Atonement” (from 2006’s Amputechture).You can see a clip of the song below:The Mars Volta, “Vicarious Atonement” at the Factory in Deep Ellum on Sept. 22, 2022Beyond that, numerous pieces were performed from their initial run of records for the first time in nearly – or literally – fifteen years.For instance, their inaugural LP (2003’s De-Loused in the Comatorium) was acknowledged via classics such as “Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of),” “Televators” and “Drunkship of Lanterns.” Then, highlights such as “L'Via L'Viaquez,” “Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus,” “Viscera Eyes,” and “Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound” represented later albums.Of course, The Mars Volta played the same sequence at the same venue last night (Sept. 23). If these first two setlists are anything to go by, it doesn’t look like they’ll be showing any love to either 2008’s The Bedlam in Goliath or 2009’s Octahedron.We’ll just have to wait and see what their upcoming shows bring.On that note, you can still catch The Mars Volta’s 2022 United States tour through the end of October.

Loudwire;Slipknot's Corey Taylor Reveals the Job He First Wanted Before Becoming a Musician;He also answers questions from fifth grade students in a new interview.;"As a guest on BBC Sounds with host Craig Charles, Slipknot's Corey Taylor revealed the job he first wanted as a child, before becoming a musician and, in a convenient twist, he also answered questions that were submitted by fith grade students at a U.S. school.Charles acknowledges Taylor as the type of person who can likely succeed in anything he puts his mind to and inquired about what the singer would be doing today if he had not become a world renowned musician.""I wanted to be a teacher, to be honest. I wanted to be a history teacher, but I quickly learned in my mock up classes that I would do as a 12-year-old for my six-year-old sister that I don't have patience for any of this. None — not one drop,"" the singer says, ""And I realized that I was going to have to go to school for years and years and years and I also didn't have patience for that. So, I just kind of tucked that love for history and whatnot into my back pocket and kind of waited for whatever to come to me.""Keeping with this theme, the discussion then shifts to a viral TikTok video where a fifth grade music teacher used Slipknot's ""Wait and Bleed"" as an example of how to count out and identify meter. The song was selected after one of her students was disgruntled at the rap example that was being used, preferring heavy metal, which the teacher was familiar with and began vocalizing the lyrical melody while tapping a hand drum.When part of an interview with the teacher is played back, Taylor can't believe it. ""It's not often that I find myself at a loss for words,"" he admits, ""That's pretty rad, dude. I don't even know what to say, man, I'm infecting a whole new generation [laughs].""Students from that class also recorded themselves asking questions for the Slipknot frontman. One question was about if the band has any songs that change time signatures and Taylor identified ""Vermillion"" as one that perfectly fits the bill.""'Vermillion' is actually a song that goes from three-four into four-four and kind of back and forth. I think there’s a section in there that goes from three-four to seven-eight, actually, which is very weird. It all kind of ties together with a riff that could go either way. And it allows us to kind of flow back and forth between them,"" explains Taylor.Other questions pertained to meter, if Slipknot intentionally write in certain time signatures or if it just happens naturally as well as how he became a musician and what inspires him to make music.After answering those questions from the students, Charles remarks that the singer sounds like he would have been a ""brilliant"" teacher.""There are times that I wish maybe I might've gone back to it,"" he says of teaching, ""I've done special classes with kids who work in music and stuff and it was great. But I barely have enough patience for my own kids, I don't know if I could do it with anybody else's kids [laughs].""Slipknot's U.S. tour with Crown the Empire and Ice Nine Kills finishes up on Oct. 7.

Loudwire;Ghost's Tobias Forge - I'd Rather Be More Like Rammstein Than Pearl Jam;Apples to oranges.;"Ghost have always been a unique band. They fall into the shock rock category more than any other, as their theatrical performances are a huge part of their identity as a band. Speaking with The Pit, leader Tobias Forge has cited another compelling band as one he strives to be like — Rammstein.Though Ghost and Rammstein have pretty much nothing in common sonically or visually, they do have the shock component in common. Rammstein's shows are full of pyrotechnics and other dramatic visuals, and their songs tend to have some controversial lyrics that push the envelope, whereas Ghost experiment more with their appearance and storytelling during their performances.“If there’s a comparison to make, it’s better for us to compare ourselves to more contemporary bands rather than my idols. All those '60s bands, it feels like they were 100 years ago now, with a completely different set of rules and a different world. But even talking about AC/DC, Metallica or Iron Maiden, it was a different time and age,"" Forge explained.“But if I compare us to a band that’s at least a little bit closer to me, generationally, it would be Rammstein. I have no intention of sounding like them, but as a visionary, it’s motivating for me to see how a band that were doing arenas up until a couple of years ago now play stadiums.""The Ghost mastermind noted that there's a difference between playing arenas and selling out arenas, and further added that he'd rather put on an exciting show than be known for being more simplistic.""[Rammstein are] also a fictional sort of band, highly themed, and they put on a show, as opposed to Pearl Jam, who go up in normal street-wear and play on a carpet, and who seem like your down-to-earth, well-educated bros. Ha ha! So I’d see Rammstein as the sort of guidepost that I’m working towards,"" he elaborated.Perhaps Forge has been speaking with Nikki Sixx.";2022-04-08;https://loudwire.com/ghost-tobias-forge-rather-be-rammstein-than-pearl-jam/;2022-04-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREGHOST'STOBIASFORGE-I'DRATHERBEMORELIKERAMMSTEINTHANPEARLJAM

Loudwire;Behemoth's Nergal Slams Majority of New Metal Albums for Sounding 'Robotic';The musician opined on modern production.;"On top of his music, Behemoth bandleader Adam ""Nergal"" Darski is known to metalheads for freely speaking his mind on a wide variety of topics, including the very business of metal — just two months ago, he warned metal musicians against starting new bands.""Do you really want to put another song on another album that no one will pay attention to?"" Nergal asked at the time. Now, the Behemoth figurehead and extreme metal veteran is taken modern metal record-making to task, saying the production of most metal music today sounds ""robotic.""""Every band these days, you talk to every band, and every band — literally, heavy metal band, thrash, death, whatever — says, 'Oh, we managed to get that organic sound,'"" Nergal recently illustrated to Australia's Heavy magazine. (via Blabbermouth)""And then I go and listen to those records,"" he continued. ""I'm, like, 'There's nothing organic about this record.' Ninety-nine percent of the records, they sound robotic. Every fucking click, every kick, every snare drum, every part of the record is exactly the same.""Nergal opined, ""It's not organic. Organic is when music fluctuates, when there's dynamics, when it goes up and down. … These days, you can fucking perfect things to the point that you cannot fucking listen to it. Because the perfection makes things boring, imperfect and … uninteresting. Live, it's not perfect – that's why it's so fucking exciting. So why make things that are just so fucking polished?""The musician, who also performs in the country-blues group Me and that Man, added, ""I don't get it, especially in extreme metal music. It's gotta be fucking weird, it's gotta be dangerous. Where is the danger factor? So I really wanted to bring the danger factor back to our music.""Behemoth released their latest, Opvs Contra Natvram, last fall. Listen to the effort's ""Versvs Christvs"" below.

Loudwire;Spoiler - Iron Maiden Debut Three 'Senjutsu' Songs + Samurai Eddie at First 2022 Show;There were quite a lot of setlist changes.;"On May 22, Iron Maiden kicked off the 2022 edition on their ongoing Legacy of the Beast world tour with a show in Zagreb, Croatia where the band not only debuted a new samurai Eddie onstage, but three new songs off last year's Senjutsu album.It's the first deviation in the setlist on the Legacy of the Beast trek, which continues through the summer and will return to North America this fall. Rather than opening with ""Aces High"" and a spitfire plane dangling overheard, the Powerslave cut instead appeared at the very end of the night as Maiden stepped back out onstage for a second encore.This was the first time Maiden ever closed a show with ""Aces High.""In it's place (and the place of other tracks which have been discarded from previous tour sets) were the three leadoff songs on Senjutsu, the title track, ""Stratego"" and ""The Writing on the Wall,"" backed by an entirely new element of the stage production that matches the Japanese theme of the record's visuals.The other setlist change came with the inclusion of Blood Brothers, a standout on 2000's Brave New World and it was the first time Iron Maiden had played this since 2017.These four additions to the setlist came at the expense of ""2 Minutes to Midnight,"" ""The Wicker Man,"" ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""For The Greater Good of God,"" all of which had been staples of the Legacy of the Beast setlists until now.The members of the band appeared to be no worse for the wear after two years away from the road and Bruce Dickinson sounded particularly strong as he comes up on what will be his 64th birthday later this summer.See the complete setlist directly below and watch fan-shot footage of the Senjutsu tracks further down the page.Iron Maiden Setlist — May 22, 2022 (via setlist.fm)01.

Get a closer look at the clip at the bottom of this post.Much like they did when releasing the massive hit ""Photograph,"" Nickelback have pumped up the nostalgia on their latest single, ""Those Days.""The track, which is taken off the rock powerhouse's forthcoming album, Get Rollin', follows the ultra heavy ""San Quentin"" and, stylistically, changes things up quite a bit. ""Those Days"" has a trace of country vibes, opening with some acoustic guitar strumming as Chad Kroeger recollects times gone by and days of blissful ignorance (""Remember when we thought that first base was just holding hands"").Prince's ""Purple Rain,"" Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"" and Guns N' Roses' ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" all get name-checked as well as Nickelback go back to the good ol' days of their youth and the youth of so many of their fans.At the end of the song, Kroeger proposes a question to us all — ""What would you be doing back in those days?""Read the lyrics to ""Those Days"" directly below and listen to the song further down the page.

Loudwire;Dave Mustaine Willing to Forgive David Ellefson but 'Won't Play Music With Him Anymore';The Mega-man gets real about the split with his former bandmate.;"Megadeth bandleader Dave Mustaine said he's willing to forgive the heavy metal act's former bass player, David Ellefson. But he's unwilling to play music with him again.That's how Mustaine laid it out to Metal Hammer in a candid interview on Friday (June 24).Megadeth's new single, ""We'll Be Back,"" arrived the day before. The band's 16th studio album, The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead! comes out in September. Last year, Ellefson was let go from the group amid a sex scandal. Bassist James LoMenzo replaced him last month; Testament's Steve Di Giorgio stepped in to record bass on the album.""I have made mistakes myself and so I know what it feels like to have people gunning for you,"" Mustaine tells Metal Hammer. ""But what we had to remember is that Megadeth has a lot of moving parts to it. …  I've made decisions in the past that were detrimental to the security of the band, and I know what harm that caused.""He adds, ""But I don't want to be saying anything about anyone who is unable to defend themselves.""Still, the Megadeth singer-guitarist continues, ""Let me just say this — it was a hard decision that had to be made. There were a lot of people involved and I had to make a decision, because unfortunately, when you're the leader, you're the one that has to suck it up and face the music. All I wanted to do was make a clean break, and not hurt anyone, not hurt the fans and not hurt him. I just wanted to move on, and I hope the gentleman concerned is doing okay. I imagine there was some adjustment that had to take place when it happened.""Recalling the fallout of Megadeth's two-year breakup from 2002 and Ellefson's subsequent $18.5 million lawsuit in 2004, Mustaine says, ""I've forgiven him before when he sued me and I'lll forgive him a thousand times. I just won't play music with him anymore.""Mustaine also spoke of the decision's difficulty to Rolling Stone this week, saying, ""It was hard on me letting him go. And I'm happier now than I’ve ever been.""Last year, Ellefson returned in The Lucid — a band featuring Sponge singer Vinnie Dombroski and Fear Factory drummer Mike Heller — with the singles ""Damned"" and ""Maggot Wind."" Meanwhile, Megadeth's ""We'll Be Back"" marks the Mustaine-led band's studio debut of drummer Dirk Verbeuren, who joined in 2016 but had yet to contribute on LP.The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead! arrives on Sept. 2. This summer, Megadeth will head out on tour with Five Finger Death Punch for a slew of shows in North America.

Loudwire;Rob Trujillo's Advice for Young Musicians + His Bassist Son Tye;Learn some valuable lessons from one of the best.;"Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo was a guest on The Ex-Man With Doc Coyle podcast and he offered great advice for young musicians as well as the advice he gave his son, Tye, when the kid was 12 years old touring with Korn.A lot of the podcast's focus is placed on Trujillo's early career, fitting the ""ex-man"" theme as a former member of Ozzy Osbourne, Suicidal Tendencies and Jerry Cantrell. Chatter also surfaced around Mass Mental and Infectious Grooves, two funk metal bands Trujillo played in during his youth, both of which reformed in the mid-2010s.With experience comes wisdom, and the bassist had a strong message for young musicians who are just starting out.""When you're in a band, it's about the relationship. Creative people can be very complicated as people in life as individuals. It's one thing to be able to play. You've got to be able to play... that gets you through the door. But then you've got to be able to be a solid individual with these guys that are going to become your new family. A lot of times you'll have sort of a role in that band that you may not have in other situations. That is imperative that you sustain your responsibility, not just as a player, which goes without saying, as a friend, as support,"" Trujillo advised (transcribed by Loudwire).These situations may be difficult at times as well, to which Trujillo attested, ""Any band I've ever been in — Ozzy, Jerry Cantrell — I've had everybody at, no disrespect, their worst in their lives [in regards to drugs and partying]. At that time, it's like, 'Okay, how do I make this work? How do I prevent the volcano from erupting?'""He chalked it about to being able to properly read the room and have a sense of where someone is at emotionally, identifying it and using that information to best maintain a positive vibe in that room.Since a band is often regarded as a family of its own, the rocker urged to take what you learn by interacting with friends and family and apply it to the band.""I try to stress that to Tye, my son, because he's in a couple of bands and he's having the time of his life,"" Trujillo told Coyle, who is the guitarist in Bad Wolves, ""And I said, 'Just remember, when you go on the road, you want to be balanced and you want to balance the people that are around you. You want to be responsible and take care of your end of the deal.""Tye has bounced around between a couple bands of his own in recent years, on top of playing a gig with Suicidal Tendencies last year, and is currently amid a small run of tour dates with OTTO and tourmates Bastardane, which features Castor Hetfield, son of Metallica's James Hetfield, on drums.Citing examples from his own life which he has passed down to Tye, Trujillo recalled, ""For instance, lobby calls — when he was out with Korn when he was 12, I was his tour personal tour manager. I made sure he was up for his lobby calls because he didn't like to be up early (of course, nobody does), but I said, 'You don't want to be the guy showing up late.'""""I told him a story about me when I was that guy who was holding everybody up,"" he carried on, ""and it was actually [guitarist] Rocky [George] who had to pull me to the back of the bus when I first joined Suicidal [Tendencies] and he's like, 'Dude, you're showing up 20 minutes late to lobby calls. Everyone is waiting for you. We have to get to the next city.' And I said, 'Man, I'm sorry.' There was clarity there. I didn't say, 'Oh, screw you, man. I do what I want.' No, I realized you can't be that guy — it's about the team.""Listen to the full interview below.Robert Trujillo on The Ex-Man With Doc Coyle Podcast15 Rock + Metal Bands Featuring Kids of RockstarsTop 66 Hard Rock + Metal Bassists of All TimeSee Loudwire's picks for the Top 66 Hard Rock + Metal Bassists of All Time";2022-05-21;https://loudwire.com/metallica-rob-trujillo-advice-young-musicians-son-tye/;2022-05-21;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREROBTRUJILLO'SADVICEFORYOUNGMUSICIANS+HISBASSISTSONTYE
Loudwire;Brian May + Eddie Van Halen Collaboration Gets 40th Anniversary Box Set Reissue;'It's all here, all of it,' says May.;"Back in 1983, on a break from Queen, guitarist Brian May pulled in a number of his musical friends for a new project. Among them was Eddie Van Halen, whose band would become the biggest thing in rock over the next year with their 1984 album. While this collaborative project didn't reach the commercial highs of their respective bands, interest has continued to grow over the years, and now a 40th anniversary box set reissue digging into those sessions en route to release under the moniker, Brian May + Friends: Star Fleet Project.“It’s all here. ALL of it. Every note we played on those two days is right here, on show for the first time,"" says May. ""I will take you behind the scenes into that studio with us for two unforgettably exhilarating days.”Get Queen + Adam Lambert TicketsIn addition to May and Van Halen, the session included REO Speedwagon drummer Alan Gratzer, bassist Phil Chen (Donovan, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, Pete Townsend) and session keyboardist Fred Mandel (Supertramp, Queen, Elton John, Alice Cooper).Though only recording over a two-day period on April 21 and 22, 1983, this new collection that's part of the ""Brian May Gold Series"" features a wealth of previously unreleased material. It comes with two CDs, a vinyl LP, a vinyl single and other collector's items and will be issued as a deluxe box set on July 14. There will also be a separate, exclusive 7"" double A-side single issued on CD the same day featuring newly mixed versions of ""Star Fleet"" and ""Let Me Out."" Plus, a special red vinyl version is going to be offered through the official Queen Online store and can be pre-ordered here.For now, fans can check out an edited single version of ""Star Fleet"" that's available as a digital single. It's available for digital download and streaming at this location.Brian May + Friends, ""Star Fleet""brian may + friends, star fleet, let me outBrian May Gold Seriesloading...In the sleeve notes for the box set, May says, “We are going to give you everything… every take of every song, the things that went wrong, the laughing, the finding new things to do. But it won’t be just a remaster – we’ve rescued everything from the original multitracks, every detail magnificently remixed, and more! You’ll hear every take from the historic 1983 sessions plus fragments of conversations, outtakes and musical experimentation.”The original three-track mini-album was released on Oct. 31, 1983, featuring a full-length version of ""Star Fleet"" that was inspired by May's viewing of a Japanese-made kid's science fiction series of the same name. The program had become a favorite of the guitarist and his son, who was four-years-old at the time. The album also featured the song ""Let Me Out,"" a track that allowed for May and Van Halen to put their guitar soloing efforts to the test.May says, “If Paul hadn’t written a very catchy song as the theme tune for that kid’s TV science fiction drama series, things would have been different. The signature tune began to stick in my head, and I could hear my own arrangement of the tune developing in my mind. But how to record it? So one morning, I woke up in Los Angeles on a break from activities with Queen and made some phone calls. I’ve told the story of what happened next in the material you will find in this box. The outcome was something I will forever treasure.”“We did a little preparation on the phone and at home with tiny Rockman amps and earphones. Then we went in. The tapes rolled. My LA neighbor Alan Gratzer beat the hell out of his kit with the fattest, heaviest drum sticks I had ever seen. Phil Chen, a friend I had met when he played with Rod Stewart, brought his unusual style of funk-orientated rock playing to the party, along with his sunny Caribbean energy and humor. Fred Mandel, one of the classiest keyboard players I have ever met, tickled both the ivories and some very technical synth patches to bring the spacey riffs to life,"" he continued.""Ed (I can still never call him ‘Eddie Van Halen’ because he more than once told me that he found it annoying!) played the guitar as if it were a piano … tapping and snapping and sliding and skipping around the fingerboard like an electric sprite - always with a cheeky smile,"" recalled May. ""If anything he did was difficult for him, he never showed it. A total original. Pure joy. What an everlasting privilege to play with him.”Revisiting the music for the 40th anniversary set, May says, “It’s been very exciting to open up the vault to find these tapes where, in the blink of an eye, I’m trading licks with my friends including the fantastic Ed Van Halen. It’s highly emotional, especially since Ed is sadly no longer around. We have since also lost Phil - so the rest of us cherish these fleeting moments together.”The album also includes the epic ""Blues Breaker,"" where May and Van Halen get to share in their guitar passions. “It was inspired by John Mayall’s Blues Breakers, the album with Eric Clapton reading The Beano on the front cover. Edward said, ‘This is great for me; I haven’t played like this in years. This is where I come from! I didn’t come up doing tapping and all the fireworks. I grew up doing blues, wanting to be like Eric Clapton and do something melodic,” recalled May.“There was a lot of ebullience, a lot of exploration, discovery and astonishment,” he adds. “And some truly magical moments when everything gelled together - a fusion of energies!”Of working with Van Halen, May marveled, “[He was] never quite treading the same path twice. Ed was a wonderful soul. Listening to him and me, I feel completely outclassed by him in the studio. But in a very pleasant way – what a joy for me to be around a guy who could do all that. Such a privilege.”“So, you’ll hear us in the studio trading licks,” adds May. “We’ve cleaned up the mix and now EVH’s sound is larger than life. You’ll hear the development of his solo, which I always thought was one of the greatest things he did… a real immortal classic of Ed Van Halen pieces.”READ MORE: Brian May Names His Greatest GuitaristsAs you can see in the full track listing below, the box set includes multiple takes of songs, interviews with Los Angeles DJs Cynthia Fox and Bob Coburn, a live version of ""Let Me Out,"" discussion and banter from the sessions, multiple Eddie Van Halen solos and more.

Loudwire;David Lee Roth Reveals the Nickname Van Halen Had for Eddie Van Halen;The whole band would call him this!;"David Lee Roth and his Van Halen bandmates used to call Eddie Van Halen what? Indeed, the influential hard rock quartet had a personal nickname for the Van Halen guitarist that came from a special source.On an episode of Roth's The Roth Show podcast, the former Van Halen singer kept it all in the family, first remembering the time his grandmother came to a Van Halen show but left early. After discussing the gig, the rocker looked back on the familial nickname that he and the group reserved for Eddie, the iconic Van Halen figurehead who died in 2020 at age 65.Listen to the episode near the bottom of this post.Roth set the scene at a Miami concert back in the day by addressing Van Halen's affinity for firearms. ""We brought our brand new Japanese pellet rifles with us,"" the singer explains on the Feb. 16 Roth Show, as transcribed by Loudwire.com. ""Played the show at the Sportatorium in Miami — a very successful show."" (The gig was likely in 1980 or 1984, per Setlist.fm.)He recalls, ""I remember they brought my 90 — Jesus, I think she was, 95-year-old grandma. They had bought her some brand new — I think they were Nike tennis shoes. That were several sizes too big for her.""Roth's Grandma Left Van Halen Show EarlyHowever, Roth's grandmother ultimately left ""halfway through the show,"" the singer remembers.She ""demanded to leave 'cause she thought the volume was gonna shake her bones apart,"" he adds. ""Came backstage, [said] hello — 'Oh, I love ya, darling; I love ya, darling.' She was like Aunt Em out of Wizard of Oz — 'Ah, love ya, darling.' Pinched my face and everything.""Fin Costello, Getty ImagesFin Costello, Getty Imagesloading...The singer continues, ""And halfway through the show I said, 'What happened to Grandma?' At the end of the night — Oh, she [thought] the volume was gonna shake her bones apart. So she took off.""Eddie Van Halen's Nickname in Van HalenAfter the Van Halen concert in Miami, the band ""adjourned to the Holiday Inn,"" Roth remembers.""Previously that day, I had sent out my security guard,"" he illustrates before sharing the nickname the group used for the guitarist. It differentiated Eddie from the security guard who was also named Ed.""We didn't call Eddie Van Halen 'Eddie,' we called him 'Vard,'"" Roth says. ""That's because his mother used the Dutch expression"" of the Dutch-born guitarist's name.He adds, ""The way she said it was Dutch — Edvard! Edvard! And we would call him Vard. My security guy's name was Ed, and we called him 'Big' Ed.""Roth shares other tales of his time in the band on previous episodes of The Roth Show. It returned for a second season last year, said Van Halen News Desk.Van Halen quietly disbanded after Eddie's death. Roth then announced his retirement from music. But he's shared previously unheard material since then.Hear the story start in at 3:53 in the episode below.The Roth Show Episode 6 - Feb. 16, 2023Top 66 Hard Rock + Metal Frontmen of All TimeSee Loudwire's picks for the Top 66 Hard Rock + Metal Frontmen of All Time";2023-02-15;https://loudwire.com/eddie-van-halen-nickname-vard/;2023-02-17;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREDAVIDLEEROTHREVEALSTHENICKNAMEVANHALENHADFOREDDIEVANHALEN
Loudwire;10 Rock + Metal Musicians Who've Been Emergency Responders;See? Music CAN save lives!;Many artists have other jobs before, during and/or after they become musicians. For instance, Kurt Cobain worked as a janitor to help get Nirvana off the ground and Debbie Harry was a Playboy Bunny before she fronted Blondie.At times, they even take on extremely selfless, dangerous and hectic gigs such as emergency responders (police officers, firefighters, EMS personnel, etc.)  However honorable and helpful they are onstage and in the studio, they’re truly making a difference behind the scenes.That’s where the 10 rockers on this list come in. Regardless of if they’re world-famous rock stars or burgeoning small-town players, each of them deserves a standing ovation for risking their lives to save others.10 Rockers Who've Been Emergency RespondersThe Jobs 26 Rock + Metal Musicians Had Before They Were Famous;2022-11-29;https://loudwire.com/rock-metal-musicians-emergency-responders/;2022-11-30;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE10ROCK+METALMUSICIANSWHO'VEBEENEMERGENCYRESPONDERS

The Man;Hear the first cover from AWOLNATION's upcoming covers album.;"It's time to wet your whistle, as AWOLNATION have revealed a new cover of the Scorpions' 1991 rock ballad, ""Wind of Change."" And singer Aaron Bruno has a couple of guests helping him out as Incubus' Brandon Boyd and the members of Portugal.The Man also turn up on the song. Listen to the cover and see the video in the player below.""Wind of Change"" is the first of a number of AWOLNATION covers that could be arriving this year as Bruno has been using the pandemic downtime to complete a covers collection titled My Echo, My Shadow, My Covers that's on schedule for a May 6 release.The singer explained to Billboard, ""I thought it was an opportunity — since I was all alone, like everybody was — to make a covers album. I’ve always wanted to do that, and these are songs that made me feel like I was escaping from the reality of 2020. And then 2021 and now 2022.""As for having not one but multiple guests on the his Scorpions cover, the musician calls it a happy accident. He initially reached out to Portugal. The Man, but a delay in the turnaround due to the band working on their own record then led him to ask longtime friend Brandon Boyd of Incubus.""Just when I got Brandon’s vocal, the Portugal guys said, ‘Hey, we’re in town. We want to come over and do the song.’ This is when everything was starting to settle down and people started to get together. I thought, ‘Oh, fuck, I hope they’re both cool with each other.’ I asked both of them separately about all three of us being on the song together, and everybody was really excited about it,"" said Bruno. ""It was a totally strange combination of worlds and a happy accident.""Speaking about the decision to cover ""Wind of Change,"" Bruno says he liked the challenge ""mostly because it was a ridiculous idea (laughs), and an enormous attempt at not butchering a classic song."" He added, ""One of the most fun things about doing a covers record is if anyone doesn’t like the songs, it’s not my fault. I didn’t write it! I chose great songs and just a weird collection of songs that I’ve always wanted to cover at some point in my career. I’m never going to claim that I’m even scratching the surface of the originals, but it was just a fun thing to do.""The original song first appeared on Scorpions' Crazy World album and was written after the band visited the Soviet Union in the late '80s toward the end of the Cold War. The song hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is a gold certified single in the U.S.Take a listen to the cover below and you can pick up the song via streaming services here.AWOLNATION Featuring Brandon Boyd + Portugal.The Man, ""Wind of Change"" (Scorpions Cover)Best Rock + Metal Covers of 2021Fresh takes on older favorites.";2022-01-21;https://loudwire.com/awolnation-cover-scorpions-wind-of-change-brandon-boyd-portugal-the-man/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREAWOLNATIONCOVERSCORPIONS''WINDOFCHANGE'WITHBRANDONBOYD+PORTUGAL.THEMAN
Loudwire;Fozzy Postpone Remaining 2022 Tour Dates While Chris Jericho Heals From Bruised Larynx;Get details on the latest postponed dates.;"UPDATE: Fozzy's Chris Jericho was hoping that he would eventually be able to return to the road in 2022, but the singer has now posted an update that his bruised larynx will need additional time to heal, thus forcing the postponement of Fozzy's remaining tour dates for the year. The singer released a statement that reads as follows and includes info on the rescheduled dates:After five weeks of waiting for my bruised larynx to heal with minimal results, my Laryngologist sent me for a vocal stroboscope today (Thursday, September 15). This is a procedure in which a camera with a strobe light attached, takes detailed pictures of your vocal cords to find any hidden issues. Now, I’ve never seen my vocal cords before (have you seen yours?!), but once I got past their gnarly appearance, I could see what the Doctor’s were seeing plain as day….that the left side of my larynx is still bruised and swollen. Good news is it’s not permanent and it IS healing! Bad news is I still need more time to heal, in order to be able to sing at 100%. Therefore we are forced to postpone and reschedule the rest of the 2022 US leg of the Save The World Tour. Nobody likes to move shows, least of all me, but if Fozzy and I can’t give you 100% during each and every show we do, we won’t do them. Therefore we are moving the shows to the spring of 2023.We will see you at the rescheduled dates in 2023 and in the meantime thank you for your love and support and for making I Still Burn our biggest hit since Judas!

Please contact venue for refund.Fozzy frontman Chris Jericho injured his throat earlier this month during a wrestling event, therefore the band's tour has been postponed so that he can make a full recovery. The rockers issued a statement on their website regarding the incident.""On Aug. 10 during the Quake by the Lake AEW event in Minneapolis, Chris suffered a throat injury that left him with a severely bruised larynx. Unfortunately, even though the injury is healing and is not permanent, Chris hasn’t fully recovered and his laryngologist has recommended that Fozzy postpone the first two weeks of the Save The World tour (scheduled to start in Columbus on Sept. 8) in order to facilitate a full recovery as soon as possible,"" the statement reads.The shows, which were originally scheduled to take place between Sept. 8 and 19 with No Resolve, GFM and Seventh Day Slumber, have been postponed until the spring of 2023. All tickets will be honored for the new dates. As it stands, Fozzy's next show is set to take place Sept. 29 in Charlotte, N.C.

Loudwire;Brent Smith Calls New Shinedown Record 'Honest' + 'Historical';He explains what makes it so controversial, and welcomes all reactions.;"Shinedown finally gave us a taste of their upcoming new album Planet Zero when they released the title track earlier today. Singer Brent Smith discussed the record's ""honest"" and ""historical"" nature in a recent chat with Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez.The band didn't start working on the follow-up to 2018's Attention Attention until after the global pandemic and its accompanying social unrest had already hit. Smith recalled that he and his bandmates actually had to sit down and make a decision as to whether or not they really wanted to tackle some of the subjects that came up in the lyrics.""If anybody describes this band with one word, I would hope it would be honest,"" the singer said. ""We just had to be honest with what we were seeing and what we were looking at, because everything was happening in real time.""One of the biggest things Smith and co. noticed happening in the world was a large dissonance between what the media was portraying, and what they were actually seeing with their own eyes.""Go out into the real world, because in the real world, it's not happening the way that it's being presented on these mechanisms. People would say, 'What do you mean go out into the real world? Everybody was inside.' I wasn't, I didn't stay inside. I went out... in the real world, people weren't trying to destroy each other. In the real world, people were trying to help each other,"" he noted.The frontman had previously described Planet Zero as ""controversial,"" and during this chat, he elaborated more on what he meant by that.""Not so much the fans — that's what I want the fans to do, is I want them to talk, I want them to discuss it,"" he enthused. ""I think that certain media outlets will look at this and go, 'They're really gonna discuss this. They're a band that's known for being a certain way, and they're really going to go this far as to present...'""It's heavy stuff. There's a lot of psychology to it... This band's been writing about mental health for 20 years. There's a lot of triumph on this record, though, too — an immense amount of triumph. But there's also elements here where some people will say that it's a big more aggressive than usual, but it's necessary, because the only way to get the point across in some of this material, we have to be aggressive. This was a record that was written for the people, by the people.""When covering touchy subjects, Smith is aware that Shinedown will face some scrutiny from a portion of their fanbase. But, he welcomes all reactions to the material.""The record is not a complete political record, thought-provoking record in regards to, 'This is what we think and you should think that way.' It's the complete opposite of that,"" he added. ""What it is, it's historical. Nobody writes records like these anymore.""To hear more about Planet Zero — which you can pre-order here now — tune into Loudwire Nights tomorrow (Jan. 27) at 7PM ET.Loudwire Nights with Toni Gonzalez airs nightly starting at 7PM ET.

Loudwire;Photo Shows Metallica's Kirk Hammett Performing Atop Giant Wah Pedal;Is that not that biggest pedal you've ever seen?;"Kirk Hammett gets the joke. On Tuesday (Feb. 15), the Metallica guitarist shared a photo that shows him performing on top of a giant wah pedal.""Look over there!!"" Hammett captioned the pic. That's because it shows the Metallica member and leader of The Wedding Band gesturing with his hand, stylishly pointing off-camera as a comically large yet instantly recognizable replica of a Dunlop Cry Baby Wah pedal supports his weight. That includes his instrument, cables, and, yes, his actual wah pedal.That's right — there's a wah on top of a wah. See the image down toward the bottom of this post.The photograph was taken by Ross Halfin, the prolific music photographer behind a recent book of black-and-white Metallica portraits.Over Metallica's history, Hammett has developed a bit of a reputation for his liberal use of wah, and it seems he's leaning into that now. (Once seemingly in response, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine quipped that he didn't use a wah until 2019.) Reddit has spotted Hammett's giant wah onstage before, so it looks like this is somewhat of a regular gag for the rocker.However, last year, Hammett explained that he doesn't use the wah when writing guitar solos, something he stressed of his solos on Metallica's 1991 ""Black Album,"" the landmark heavy metal effort that recently celebrated its 30th anniversary.The guitarist said his wah use before then was the ""culmination of having been on tour for …And Justice for All and just having fun on stage, stepping on my wah for a lead break or in between songs.""""But when I really think about the solos on the black album,"" he continued, ""I came up with all of them within about a week. 'Enter Sandman,' I had that one complete by the second or third time we played it. Because when the songs are strong, the solos come easy. And back then, I'd compose a solo and then, if it felt appropriate in the studio, I'd bring in the wah and see if it brought anything more out.""Hammett will release his first-ever solo EP, Portals, on April 23. Last year, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said it was ""way too early"" to talk about a new Metallica album, though the band has seemingly been working on one.Kirk Hammett Performs on Top of Giant WahMetallica: A Photo Timeline of Their Remarkable Career";2022-02-17;https://loudwire.com/kirk-hammett-giant-wah-pedal-metallica/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREPHOTOSHOWSMETALLICA'SKIRKHAMMETTPERFORMINGATOPGIANTWAHPEDAL
Loudwire;Mark Zuckerberg's Sister Sings Cyptocurrency-Themed 'We're Not Gonna Take It';Dee Snider is not impressed.;"Randi Zuckerberg, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's sister, recorded a cover of Twisted Sister's ""We're Not Gonna Take It."" The cover is aimed at promoting women in crypto. And while promoting women in tech is commendable, Twisted Sister's Dee Snider is not pleased with the creation.Randi posted the song on her Twitter, writing, ""A decade ago, I sang this song on Broadway. Today I sing this song, surrounded by new friends, as a rallying cry for the women of web3. Together, we can accomplish anything. And have fun doing it! #WAGMI""Randi's cryptocurrency-themed version includes lyrics like, ""you’ve got coins from different blockchains and want to do some trading"" and ""carpe your crypto diem.""When Snider found out about the cover, he took to Twitter to express his opinion on the situation. In a string of tweets, he called the song ""dog shit,"" saying he couldn't believe it has millions of views. He also said that Randi did not get the go-ahead to make the cover, and that the band's legal team is exploring their options. You can check out his tweets below.""We're Not Gonna Take It"" has become one of the most popular anthems of defiance. Many groups and people have co-opted it, trying to attach it to one agenda or another. This occasionally leads Snider to weigh in on if he supports the use of the song for a particular agenda.Recently, Ukrainians have been using the song as a battlecry during the conflict with Russia, and Snider gave his full support of their use of the song.What do you think of Randi Zuckerberg's ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" cryptocurrency-themed cover?20 Artists Who Told Politicians to Stop Using Their MusicPoliticians are consistently using songs by bands without their permission, and these artists had enough of it.";2022-03-05;https://loudwire.com/mark-zuckerberg-sister-cyptocurrency-themed-were-not-gonna-take-it-twisted-sister-video/;2022-03-06;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREMARKZUCKERBERG'SSISTERSINGSCYPTOCURRENCY-THEMED'WE'RENOTGONNATAKEIT'

COVID, no proms, no graduations, an insurrection, school shootings. The list goes on.""He added, ""Their lives have been tossed around like clothes in a dryer, as the tensions within our country have infiltrated our own homes, friends and families.

The group were grunge icons in the '90s, evolving their sound to something a little more glammy by the end of the decade. But which of their albums is the best? That's what we want to know during this week's Loudwire Nights Album of the Week poll.You'll have until Friday at 12N ET to cast your votes. We’ll then play the three tracks from the album with the most votes during Loudwire Nights' Album of the Week block to start the following Monday's show!After forming in Los Angeles in 1989, Hole made their debut with 1991's Pretty on the Inside album, a critically hailed offering that started generating the buzz for the band thanks in part to such songs as ""Teenage Whore,"" ""Garbage Man"" and the title track.That buzz paid off with a commercial breakthrough for their sophomore set, 1994's Live Through This. The set made Hole MTV and radio stars with songs such as ""Miss World"" ""Doll Parts,"" ""Violet"" and ""Softer, Softest.""It was a lengthy turnaround for their next album, with Celebrity Skin arriving in 1998 with a bit of a makeover. The stellar title track became one of their biggest hits, while ""Malibu"" and ""Awful"" commanded the airwaves as well.After a decade away that included a solo album, Love returned under the Hole moniker with a whole new group of players surrounding her on 2010's Nobody's Daughter.

Loudwire;The 5 Best Zombie-Themed Music Videos;Brainsssss!!!;"Stu Folsom, leader of ""death western"" metal group SpiritWorld, is here to take you on a brain-starved trip through the Best Zombie-Themed Music Videos.The band has a trilogy of blood-splattered, western-tinged videos of their own, dating back to ""The Bringer Of Light"" single off the Pagan Rhythms debut album and up to the current with cinematic pieces for ""Relic of Damnation"" and the Deathwestern album title track, so who better than Folsom to talk shop regarding other artists who have delved into the world of the undead?If you're not familiar with SpiritWorld, well... you've really been missing out. They're quite groove-intensive with melodic accents and muscular hardcore riffs all coalescing to yield some decisively catchy tracks. It's not so much genre-mashing as it is genre-merging, creating a fresh new sound with an even fresher look. It also might be the first time rhinestones and cowboy hats have not at all been off-putting in heavy metal, so credit to Folsom for pulling off the impossible.The lesson here? Come for the zombies, stay for the six-shooters and riffs.Before we get to Folsom's picks further down the page for the Best Zombie-Themed Music Videos, check out the video for SpiritWorld's ""Deathwestern"" song directly below. Look for Deathwestern to drop on Nov. 25 on Century Media (get your copy here) and follow the band on Instagram, Facebook and Spotify.SpiritWorld, ""Deathwestern"" Music VideoBloodbath, “Zombie Inferno”Hot rods, fire, gore, riffs!

But what about the kind of tune that sneaks up on you with its creepiness? It might have a sunny melody or what seems like a simple lovelorn lyric.

And then I'll look at some crazy idea of what they think they can get away with,"" reveals Rockett in the video. It's also been revealed that scammers have reached out to his family members, closest friends and business associates with their cons.Within the clip, the couple detail some of the many red flags that have happened with scammers reaching out to fans with requests using Rockett's name as bait. TC reveals, ""They have been going down and contacting privately everybody that leaves comments on Rikki's posts, that's on Facebook, that's on Instagram, that's on YouTube and what they are doing is they have a fake profile to make it look like they are Rikki's personal manager. They pretend to work at either Capitol, Universal or some official sounding type of company.""Within this video, TC details one particular scam and how they were able to work to catch the person. As noted in the description on their new video, ""100% throw and go video because it just needed to get out right now! Yeah, a scammer.

Loudwire;Machine Gun Kelly Shuts Down TikToker Who Claimed He Didn't Play Guitar Live;Tickets to someone's downfall.;"Machine Gun Kelly's guitar playing was called into question last week on TikTok when a video went viral of a Guitar Center employee dissecting his guitar playing and claiming that a kill switch on his guitar seen in several photos suggested he was performing live without the instrument's volume turned on. After the video circulated on the social media site, the musician shot his own TikTok in which he shut down the theory, explaining where this idea went wrong.The clip, titled ""Machine Gun Kelly EXPOSED,"" started with Gunnar Dugrey sharing with viewers that after receiving the new Machine Gun Kelly signature Schecter guitar at his store, he first took notice of the kill switch. ""It's got a pretty interesting feature, it's called a kill switch. If you flip this in the down position, it cuts off all the volume making it completely silent,"" stated Gunnar, then adding, ""That got me wondering, how does MGK use this in his live performances.""Dugrey then shows various shots of Kelly performing with the kill switch in the down position, adding, ""It certainly seems like he doesn't use it for much other than muting his guitar while he plays.""But after the video circulated over four million times, one of the people to view it was MGK himself, who then dissected what was wrong with the hypothesis. Sharing a duet video, Kelly chimed in on each point, then explaining, ""Hold on, you reverse-engineered it to go like this 'cause when it goes down, it's on. I only play my guitar live. You should go watch a performance, you can clearly hear that live.""The musician also mocked back, ""You're wearing a Liquid Death hat. I'm also a part-owner in that company so you're promoting me while hating on me.""@machinegunkelly #duet with @gunnar_dugrey ♬ original sound - Gunnar DüGreyAfter MGK's TikTok response circulated, Dugrey posted his own video apology to the musician. ""I was wrong and I'm happy to admit that. This was the first guitar that I had seen that had a kill switch like this and it was in fact off in the down position and on in the up position when it came out of the box but I didn't realize you can apparently spin this thing around. Usually toggle switches like this are used for pickups and you have to rewire it for the change of direction. There's no spinning for something like this, so I just didn't consider that and that's on me,"" he explained.He also admitted that had he done more research, he would've seen that the video that one of the photos came from clearly showed MGK playing live. He also added that he only had 200 followers and didn't think his video would blow up like it did or be viewed as serious hit piece, but he did offer his formal apology to the musician.@gunnar_dugrey My response to @machinegunkelly #FYP #guitardrama #MGK #machinegunkelly #guitar ♬ original sound - Gunnar DüGreyMachine Gun Kelly, very much playing his guitar, is ramping up to the March 25 release of his Tickets to My Downfall follow-up, Mainstream Sellout.

Loudwire;Musician Testifies About Ticketmaster 'Monopoly,' Goes Viral;His explanation is extremely detailed.;"Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation dominate the world of event ticketing, and the public is becoming increasingly frustrated with their practices. A musician has testified against Ticketmaster during a Senate Judiciary committee, providing a thorough explanation as to why the company is problematic from an artist's perspective, and has gone viral as a result.During the Tuesday hearing, committee members from both parties criticized the company, calling it a monopoly that ""hinders competition and hurts consumers,"" according to the New York Times.When tickets for Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour went on sale this past November, the server was overwhelmed by the volume of fans trying to buy them, and it crashed. Though a few million people were successful in their transactions, another couple of million were left disappointed. Tickets on the resale market were priced as high as $45,000, according to Time.The situation then raised some red flags, and the U.S. Senate called for an antitrust hearing to investigate the lack of healthy competition within the live event ticketing industry.The hearing took place on Tuesday (Jan. 24), and while Swift was not in attendance, Joe Berchtold, president of Live Nation Entertainment, was, as well as an artist named Clyde Lawrence, who spoke on behalf of musicians. A video of his testimony has gone viral.""Most of the issues we face stem from the fact that Live Nation/Ticketmaster often acts as three things at the same time — the promoter, the venue and the ticketing company. Let's imagine we just played a sold-out show at a venue Live Nation owns and operates. When an artist plays these venues, they're required to use Live Nation as the promoter. Far from simply advertising, the promoter coordinates and pays the upfront costs to put together a concert, such as renting and staffing a venue, and striking a deal with the performer,"" Lawrence stated.""Since both our pay and theirs is a share of the show's profits, we should be true partners, aligned in our incentives — keep costs low, while ensuring the best fan experience. But with Live Nation not only acting as the promoter, but also as the owner and/or operator of the venue, it seriously complicates these incentives,"" he continued.Lawrence pointed out that artists are unable to negotiate with Live Nation because of their control over the industry as a whole.""If they want to take 10 percent of the revenues and call it a 'facility fee,' they can, and have. If they want to charge $30,000 for the 'house nut,' they can, and have. If they want to charge us $250 for a stack of 10 clean towels, they can, and have. Once these costs, some of which went to Live Nation's subsidiaries, are taken into account, the remainder is split between Live Nation and the band.""The musician further pointed out that the artist, in this hypothetical situation, gets about $12 from a ticket with a $30 face value. The fans, however, didn't pay $30 for the tickets — they paid $42 because of added fees.Watch the video clips below to hear the rest of Lawrence's detailed explanation.

In one verse, Kiedis confirms what we already knew, singing, ""Acid landing on my tongue.""Musically, it's one to get lost in as funky bass lines roll onward and creamy guitar textures and distorted effects help to further alter reality on this chill track.Take a listen further down the page.""We're just so happy to be making music again,"" drummer Chad Smith tells ALT CTRL Radio on Apple Music 1.""Like most people, and creative people, and artists, to be able to have that opportunity to go out and play concerts and play new music. We wrote a lot of songs during the pandemic time and we recorded them all. We just wanted this next record to be an extension of Unlimited Love. It stands on its own,"" he continues.""We felt like we had so many songs that we love that we just need to have them all come out, and we don't want to put them all out at once,"" Smith adds, ""Here's the second batch and it's just as important. And just as effervescent to use your word, and joyful and happy.""The creative juices with returning guitarist John Frusciante have obviously been flowing and the drummer notes that wide range of possibilities that exist in the band's music in stating, ""The cool thing about our band is one of the things I think is kind of whatever we do, it sounds like the Chili Peppers. You got Anthony's voice, is so identifiable. And then you got the band, which has a unique sound. Of course, having John Frusciante back in our band again, we've got that chemistry going and we just want to share it with everybody.

Loudwire;Porno for Pyros Share Intimate Rehearsal Video From Reunion Tour;Perry Farrell and co. run through 'Bad Sh-t' backstage.;"Porno for Pyros, the reunited '90s alt-rock band led by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell, have given an intimate look at a backstage rehearsal from their recent reunion tour.In a short video they shared last week, Porno for Pyros are seen performing a low-key version of ""Bad Shit,"" a deep cut from their 1993 debut, also called Porno for Pyros. In that decade, they followed it up with 1996's Good God's Urge. But so far, Porno for Pyros haven't released a studio album outside of the '90s. However, it appears that could change soon, according to a 2022 interview with Farrell.Watch the video down toward the bottom of this page.""Quick run through before we hit the stage…"" Porno for Pyros said of the relaxed rehearsal they posted to Instagram on Feb. 4. Subsequent comments on the clip include several requests from fans for more Porno for Pyros shows, including concerts in Europe.""I always wanted you guys back at it,"" one commenter replied. ""Even some new songs. But the old songs are def most of my alltime favs. So glad you are back at it.""""Sound(s) amazing! Any chance of a tour?"" another fan added. ""Perry could sing me the phone book, awesome stuff,"" one remarked. ""Thank you guys for returning,"" another said.In 2020, Porno for Pyros got onstage for the first time in 26 years (apart from a brief 2009 gig) to play Lolla2020, the virtual version of Farrell's Lollapalooza festival that replaced the live event that year.In 2022, Porno for Pyros returned in earnest with several shows that culminated at that year's Lollapalooza.Will Porno for Pyros' first album in 27 years finally emerge in 2023? Indications are good. Last year, Farrell said he would be working on new Porno for Pyros material in addition to new stuff for Jane's Addiction and his Kind Heaven Orchestra project.""As soon as we finish this [Porno for Pyros'] Lolla performance, we're going back home and I'm going to be recording through August,"" the singer explained.

Loudwire;30 Years Ago: Stone Temple Pilots Make Their Debut With 'Core';On Sept. 29, 1992, Stone Temple Pilots introduced themselves to the world with the strong debut disc 'Core.';"As 1992 arrived, the explosion of ""grunge"" was hitting new heights and a new band from SoCal was ready for their turn in the spotlight. A four-piece featuring bassist Robert DeLeo, guitarist Dean DeLeo, drummer Eric Kretz and a charismatic vocalist named Scott Weiland had just taken the name Stone Temple Pilots after forgoing their previous moniker Mighty Joe Young due to a potential legal conflict. On Sept. 29, 1992, the band arrived on the scene by releasing their debut disc Core.The Stone Temple Pilots story starts several years earlier, as the DeLeo brothers left their home base in New Jersey, with older brother Dean getting a job offer in California and briefly giving up music. ""This was in probably '85. I moved out in '84. He was into this job. I think that around '87 he got the urge to get some equipment again,"" Robert DeLeo told KNAC. ""I had gotten some inheritance money from our dad passing away. He passed away when I was a year old. So I got about $15,000 when I was 21. I sunk it all into a home studio. So I had a home studio in an apartment in Long Beach, and started really getting into recording and engineering and writing songs ... This was around '86 I guess, because that's when I met Scott. He came over with the band that he just broke up with and asked if I could record some songs for the new band he was forming. I started recording some songs for him, and then he asked me to play on the songs, and then he asked me to join his band.""""I told him that if he wanted to do something, I wanted to do something, but that we should go do something else,"" said DeLeo. ""It was tough for him because [the other band members] were his friends. We had gotten Eric out of the paper. He was playing with us for a while. I really wanted to keep him, I liked his playing, and we played well together, and I loved Eric as a person.""The final piece of the puzzle was getting Dean back into the fold. ""We coerced Dean into picking his guitar up out of the attic and strapping it back on again,"" Weiland told RIP Magazine. ""He had become disenchanted with the music thing and let it go, but we talked him into it. We tied him down and tickled him under his arms.""The guitarist was located in San Diego, while the other three members were up in Los Angeles at least for a while in their infancy. ""I was a master at holding the phone between my knees and playing a guitar into it,"" laughed Dean during Loudwire's interview with the guitarist. ""That’s how we wrote a lot at this time. I was living in San Diego and those guys were up in L.A. and I was just like, 'Listen to this part I have!' I’d play it into his phone and 'I got a cool thing for that.' That’s how a lot of the stuff got thrown around until we all got into a room where we were really able to flesh it out.""The group eventually did flesh things out, before settling into the Rumbo Recording Studio, a place owned by the Captain and Tennille's Daryl Dragon, where they started to record the album. ""It took three weeks to record,"" recalled Scott Weiland to Metal Hammer. ""There's no point in wasting time on overproducing. At the end of the day it's only music, you see. And that's where your gut feeling kicks in.""The vocalist went on to add that they had worked on some ""sick mental poems that do not have any significance for people outside myself or the band,"" but little did he know that those songs would definitely make a connection. ""Some songs may deal with social and political subjects. Kind of a cause/effect relationship within the lyrics,"" said Weiland. ""[It's] personal stuff. I'm not much of a preacher, teacher or politician, because I'm not in a red, white or blue suit.""The first song they recorded was the brief track ""Wet My Bed,"" which came from an improv session between Weiland and Robert DeLeo. The song became notable to fans due to one of those impromptu studio moments that turns up at the end, with producer Brendan O'Brien walking into the room and then stating, ""Alright, now what?"" at the end. It didn't take long for the band to answer that question.As stated, it was a quick turnaround only sweetened by the fact the group had the trusted hands of O'Brien guiding them. ""We went into making that record really excited for a lot of reasons and one of the greatest things about my recording career was forging a lifelong friendship with Brendan O’Brien,"" Dean DeLeo told me. ""That is something I would never ever change, man. I learned so much about guitar playing and a certain level of musicianship, recording techniques and really, just Brendan’s whole philosophy which is you can’t overthink this. We’re going to just play and hopefully we capture something. That’s how we approached that record. We set up to play live – we were all in one room. We had speakers in isolation booths and the drums, and Rob and I stood in front of Eric and we just played those songs live.""Stone Temple Pilots, ""Sex Type Thing""Once the album arrived, Stone Temple Pilots enjoyed a steady rise in popularity. With ""Sex Type Thing"" being the first single launched, one of the early narratives was that the band were pro-feminist, but the bravado of the lyrical content in the song was something that stirred up debate with listeners who may or may not have understood Weiland's lyrical approach. The singer found himself having to defend his lyrical content, telling Rolling Stone that he penned the track from the mindset of a ""typical American macho jerk"" because he didn't want to sound preachy. ""I never thought that people would ever seriously think that I was an advocate of date rape,"" said the singer. He would also tell Request Magazine, ""So many guys are brainwashed as children to fit into these macho stereotypes where they treat women disrespectfully and have this improper view of sexuality. Although that kind of man is one I utterly despise, in a sense I feel both characters are victims.""As for the musical portion of the song, it had a distinctive guitar sound to it, one that Dean DeLeo says came from a Led Zeppelin inspiration. ""I wrote that riff because I heard 'In the Light' off of Physical Graffiti. I was playing in front of my house and I happened to be outside, probably picking up after the dogs or something and I had Physical Graffiti on and it was quite loud. It was a beautiful summer day and the windows were down and that lick in 'In the Light' — the “Sex Type” lick — fits right in between it. I was basically hearing the notes in between Jimmy Page’s lick. That’s how I came up with that lick.""While ""Sex Type Thing"" wasn't a huge radio single (peaking at No. 23 at Mainstream Rock radio), it was in heavy rotation at MTV, playing alongside the likes of some of grunge's biggest acts like Alice in Chains, Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the latter of which the band was often compared to in their early days. But Stone Temple Pilots weren't exactly jumping for joy over the comparisons. ""I don’t think there’s any similarities in our bands at all,"" said Weiland to Rolling Stone. ""Not discounting Pearl Jam, but to me they're a modern-day Buffalo Springfield or something, a classic-rock band. I don't mean that in a derogatory sense. We're on a totally different trip,"" he continued, adding that he was more worried people would lump him in with The Doors whom he'd been listening to fairly regularly during recording of the disc.Stone Temple Pilots, ""Plush""Though it was a steady climb for the band during promotion of ""Sex Type Thing,"" everything really exploded for them when they issued their second single ""Plush."" The song was described by Weiland as ""a metaphor for a lost obsessive relationship."" The track became a monster hit for Stone Temple Pilots, reaching No. 1 at Mainstream Rock Radio and even crossing over to No. 18 on the pop charts. And while the song scorched up the airwaves, it got an extra boost when Weiland and Dean DeLeo appeared on Headbanger's Ball and performed an acoustic version of the track.""I think that performance, I think what people saw is truly how brilliant of a singer Scott was,"" Dean told me. ""He was obviously not just a rock singer. He has the ability to sing a lot of different things. He was just such a huge fan of country and he was weaned on that kind of acoustic stuff. He was just a great singer man, a really great singer. And I think that’s what’s really shining about that performance. I was just playing some chords, but it was the beauty of his voice — just how rich it was — and his choice of melody and of course his lyrics.""Stone Temple Pilots, ""Plush"" (acoustic)By this point, things really started to take off for Stone Temple Pilots, who got one of their first breaks opening for Megadeth. The beginning of the tour was rough for the band, who may not have been a natural fit to open for Dave Mustaine's metal outfit, but the fellow San Diegan had seen something in the band and handpicked them to open the run. “Dave was a real gentleman to us, man. He was very, very kind. He was very loving and very supportive,"" said Dean DeLeo. “Those early days, no one knew who we were and we were playing arenas opening for Megadeth to people filing in. We’d be on our third song and the place is about only a third full. You’re looking like an 8,000-seat room and there’s like maybe 1,000, 2,000 people there and people are filing in. The people that were in there were like pimple-faced boys with Iron Maiden shirts giving us the finger. It sucked ... but Mustaine saw that night after night and I’m gonna tell you something about Dave. He walked out onstage and the place goes f–king crazy and he grabs the mic and goes, ‘You listen you f–kers, I handpicked this band and they’re my friends. You better show some f–king respect,’ and he walked off. [laughs]”But as the songs started to take hold and with some sage advice from Mustaine, things started to turn around. ""Where there were like, 500-1000 people in there maybe when we were on, by the time ‘Plush’ was out [as a single], they were full,"" says DeLeo. ""The arenas were full. People were singing our songs and it changed dramatically.” He continues, ""Very early on when the “Plush” video and single came out — that’s right kids, there used to be videos attached to music — we saw things changing and changing fast. It was at that point where people were starting to buy the record and we could see more and more people coming to the shows and more and more people singing every song. I’ll tell you man, that is a very, very moving and loving beautiful experience. We’re all in it together.""Stone Temple Pilots, ""Wicked Garden""The band continued to dig deeper into Core with their third single ""Wicked Garden."" ""There’s a good example of Robert and I each having parts and bringing them together. Robert had the intros and the chorus and I have this verse and it was one of those things that just we brought together. I think he actually put that together at my house,"" recalls Dean of the track. Weiland added his lyrical touch to the song, offering his take on the loss of innocence and purity, and radio ran with the track which while it didn't replicate the ""Plush"" success, it certainly did well and helped further cement their reputation as one of rock's great new acts.Finishing out the singles, the band showed a more somber side with ""Creep."" This ode to alienation climbed up to No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock chart and proved to be a great jumping off point for their follow-up album Purple. ""Musically speaking I was thinking about a song along the lines of 'Heart of Gold' by Neil Young, which is in the key of E-minor, the saddest key of all,"" recalled Robert DeLeo. ""Scott was thinking about the lyrics, and at that time in our lives we were struggling very much. What Scott was writing about was a real life situation. Also about me, the thing about the gun. 'Creep' is a very demeaning word. It was one of those instances where we looked at ourselves, looked in the mirror.""Stone Temple Pilots, ""Creep""But while four songs dominated the airwaves, Core was a deep album for fans to embrace. Songs like the forceful opening cut ""Dead and Bloated,"" the religiously motivated ""Naked Sunday,"" the chugging rocker ""Sin"" and the late album gem ""Crackerman"" also resonated with listeners, making Core one of the most well-received debut discs in rock history.The album eventually peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and it went on to be certified eight times platinum by the RIAA. ""Plush"" received a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 1994 Grammy Awards, and the group also took home Best New Artist at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. Simply put, Core gave Stone Temple Pilots their base in the industry and showed the promise of their great career to come.Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1990s10 Unforgettable Scott Weiland Moments";2022-09-29;https://loudwire.com/stone-temple-pilots-core-album-anniversary/;2022-10-01;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRE30YEARSAGO:STONETEMPLEPILOTSMAKETHEIRDEBUTWITH'CORE'
Loudwire;Liquid Death Apologize After Joke About Nuclear Blast Logo Backfires;The joke yielded some unintended backlash toward the artist.;"The internet can be tricky at times with how things are perceived, and Liquid Death water founder Mike Cessario has issued a public apology to an artist who recently created a logo that has been used by Nuclear Blast in their promotion. Both logos feature a similar idea of a face melting off a skull, which was enough for Liquid Death to point out the similarity and take a jab at the record label.""We are honored that famous metal record label @nuclearblastrecords is so in love with Liquid Death and our mission of health and sustainability, that they recently decided to make their new logo a complete homage to our logo. Your records have been an inspiration to us for decades, so it’s a true honor to have inspired you right back,"" wrote the water company in a social media post that had the hashtags #liquiddeath and #logo.While Cessario would later reveal he meant it as a lighthearted jab, it wasn't taken as such by some readers who then started on the attack concerning the similarities.That would earn Liquid Death a return rebuke from artist Justin Moll — who had created the logo for the label — after taking plenty of backlash online. His response post read as follows:Hey @liquiddeath,It stinks you assume I lifted your skull artwork.This is a real bummer for me. Just take a look at my art - I draw skulls and stuff. All sorts of skulls - nothing special or fancy about it. For this particular project I simply developed a blasted skull in a style I've been honing for several years. I do it for fun mostly. Cause it certainly isn't about all the money I don't make.You should know that no one asked me to draw something like yours. And that I did not use reference. I created it on my own, in my attic, with a pencil and paper. It was one of several options. The only thing I was thinking about while drawing blasted skulls was how cool it was to work with such a rad company.Sorry you think I copied your art - it's not the case - I don't even like water. And to everyone else who has ruined my day: Fuck you.That response was then posted to Liquid Death's socials with their return reply, apologizing to the artist for the grief that it caused, but still pointing out that the label chose to move forward with a similar logo.""We would like to clarify our logo comparison post from yesterday. @dr.wolfenbergen we were not at all taking a jab at you as an artist. Which is why we did not tag or mention you. You drew a cool skull that coincidently looks very similar to our official logo. Nothing wrong with that,"" started the post. ""But when a multi-million dollar global record label decides to use that art as their business logo, that’s a very different thing. Especially when we know for a fact that before the logo launched, employees at Nuclear Blast voiced to higher-ups that the skull was way too similar to our skull logo, and the NB execs decided to ignore the concern and do it anyway.""Cessario went on to add, ""Would have been so easy to have the artist tweak a new skull to be more unique. Any hate from our fans to the artist is totally misguided and wrong. Not at all his fault. And to be clear, we don’t tell people to do anything. The internet is crazy. And end of the day, we don’t really care about the NB skull logo. We didn’t call lawyers like many jerkoffs would, we simply called them out in a funny way. Because shame on them for being told this feels like a Liquid Death ripoff and them doing it anyway and essentially giving us the finger that our hard work to build our brand doesn’t matter. And the hard work of artist @willcarsola who spent hours making us our very unique identifiable skull logo to build our company around.""The Liquid Death chief then concluded, ""And @dr.wolfenbergen we fucking love your work and would hire you any day to make art for us. We seriously apologize man for what you had to deal with. Again, your art is not the issue AT ALL. The wrong is what a big record label decided to do with it from a business standpoint.""But the apologizing didn't end there, with Cessario then offering another apology via Instagram. Sharing a text message sent to the artist, the Liquid Death founder stated, ""Hey Justin. This is Mike the founder of Liquid Death. Really sorry for this whole shit-uation and the idiots who berated you. When I posted the initial comparison it was intended to be a lighthearted jab. Shame on me for not fully thinking through all of the possible unintended consequences of a post like that.""He then added, ""Anyone who thinks you stole anything as an artist is an idiot. You were just drawing cool skulls, same as Will Carsola who did our logo and a lot of our art, and same as Steiner just drawing cool skulls on his Insta. No one copied anyone. And it's my fault for this misfire on making a joke in public that started this whole pointless debate in the first place. NB can monetize the skull you drew for them however they want. We don't care and never really did. Hopefully they at least paid you well. And I was serious, would love to pay you to do a piece for the bottom of our case box. Your are is rad. My bad joke was not.""Top 30 Nuclear Blast Albums";2022-06-20;https://loudwire.com/liquid-death-apologize-joke-nuclear-blast-logo-backfires/;2022-06-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRELIQUIDDEATHAPOLOGIZEAFTERJOKEABOUTNUCLEARBLASTLOGOBACKFIRES

Bassist James LoMenzo replaced him after Testament's Steve Di Giorgio stepped in to record bass on The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead!, Megadeth's new album that emerged last week.Ellefson returned in The Lucid with Sponge's Vinnie Dombroski and Fear Factory's Mike Heller. They released the singles ""Damned"" and ""Maggot Wind."" Earlier this year, Ellefson added yet another new act to his resume, the band Dieth. They released a song called ""In the Hall of the Hanging Serpents.""But that hasn't stopped Ellefson from commenting on his firing from Megadeth, such as he did during a new video interview with the podcast 2020'd this week.""I kind of saw the events of last year as just the perfect opportunity to choose box office over brotherhood,"" Ellefson said, per Blabbermouth.He added, ""I look back at it now and I feel like I got kicked out of hell. So, whatever.""Ellefson continued, ""It was just abusive. It was unnecessary. … Dave even said he had a resentment toward me that he couldn't let go.""Sharing how the collaborative nature of the songwriting between him and Mustaine had apparently broken down years before, the ex-Megadeth bassist looked back on Megadeth's 2013 studio effort, Super Collider — particularly its centerpiece, ""Kingmaker.""""The record was done, or at least my bass parts were,"" Ellefson explained. ""And Dave, at the end of the session, at the end of the day, he said to me, he said, 'Hey, man. If you wanna go through the record, if there's anything you wanna add or tweak or change, blah blah blah blah,' giving me free license to do so, 'cause he had signed off on everything. So [I said], 'All right. No problem.'""Ellefson continued, ""So after he left, me and [then-Megadeth guitarist] Chris Broderick and [producer] Johnny K sat in the studio and I said, 'You know, I do have this one little bit, this little thing,' and I showed it to them, and Broderick goes, 'Dude, that would be really cool at the beginning of 'Kingmaker'.' And I said, 'Huh. Interesting idea.' … We were all excited.""However, ""Dave walks in the next day in a much different mood,"" the bassist recalled. ""Grumpy, I might add [laughs] and not feeling so joyous as the night before. And I think either me or Johnny said, 'Hey, I've got something I want you to listen to that we worked on last night.' And there was this kind of disapproving look. And Johnny plays it for him, all excited. 'Cause I think the three of us all heard the same thing: 'Hey, if you wanna add anything, if you wanna work on anything, please do.' Well, Dave didn't seem to maybe remember that conversation. And what he walked into was, 'Why the hell are you messing with my song?' And I think he pulled Broderick aside and said, 'Don't you dare add David Ellefson's stuff to my songs.'""This fall, Ellefson will join another ex-Megadeth member, guitarist Jeff Young, on ""The MEGA Years"" tour in the U.S. Their assembled band, Kings of Thrash, will perform two early Megadeth albums in full. Guitarist Chris Poland, another former Megadeth musician, will appear as special guest. Get tickets here.Megadeth themselves are now out with Five Finger Death Punch on a trek across North America through October.

Loudwire;Who's on the Album Cover of Linkin Park's 'Meteora'?;It might not be who you think.;"Who is that on Linkin Park's Meteora album cover?With the band now promising unreleased material (and who knows what else) surrounding the 20th anniversary of the album, Linkin Park's second studio effort from 2003, we decided to look back at the mysterious person in the photo on the front of the artwork.So, do you know who the Meteora cover model is? We'll give you a hint — it's not a Linkin Park band member, such as vocalist Mike Shinoda or guitarist Brad Delson.In fact, the person on the Meteora cover — crouched down, respirator on, spray paint in hand — is the Dutch artist Boris Tellegen, also known by his graffiti tag name, Delta.Tellegen was on hand in 2003 to help Linkin Park out with the artwork for Meteora. But what was first envisioned as the final album cover — a gigantic communal mural painted by the team — was ultimately replaced by the solitary shot of Tellegen working on the art. Pretty meta, right?""We chose the image of Boris for the cover of the album because of that quiet power of it,"" Shinoda explains in The Art of Meteora, a short documentary film that accompanied the album.The mural is instead captured in photographs throughout the liner notes of Meteora. Tellegen, who first came up in the '80s graffiti scene, continues to make art to this day.

Loudwire;Is Metallica Rock or Metal?;The answer may not be as simple as you think.;"Is Metallica rock or metal? The answer may not be as simple as you might think.Sure, us metalheads wouldn't dream of lumping Metallica in with only rock music. Because, let's face it, the long-running band is the biggest heavy metal group on the planet. But aren't there particular Metallica albums and songs that skew more toward hard rock than heavy metal? And further, isn't heavy metal a form of rock music anyway?Indeed, when considering everything under the hood, ""Is Metallica rock or metal?"" is a bit of a complicated question. So let's dive in.Is Metallica Heavy Metal or Rock?Let's be clear — Metallica are generally considered a heavy metal band. After all, they're one of the pioneering bands of the thrash metal genre that emerged in the 1980s. Without Metallica's Ride the Lightning (1984), Master of Puppets (1986) and …And Justice for All (1988), the rise of thrash would have likely looked very different. And barring those early Metallica works, thrash might not have hit the mainstream vein that it did at all.But from the 1990s onward, Metallica experimented with different musical paths and incorporated styles from hard rock and even alternative rock into some of their works.READ MORE: Metallica Only Have 2 Rivals for the Title of 'Most Searched Metal Band on the Internet'Let's look at it this way: Say you were a teenage rock fan who had just discovered Metallica around the time of their 1996 album, Load. That effort's first single is the alt-rock song ""Until It Sleeps."" The next single, ""Hero of the Day,"" follows the same path. And the third Load single, ""Mama Said,"" is country-rock balladry akin to Southern rock or outlaw country.MetallicaMetallica in 1986 (Michael Ochs Archive, Getty Images)loading...Again, if you were that listener and hadn't discovered Metallica's earliest stuff, what kind of band would you label them? (Remember, there was no streaming, YouTube or Wikipedia in 1996.)Notwithstanding the similar approach taken on 1997's Reload, even when Metallica did get back to metal, it was with a tact focused on the popular styles of the time. 2003's St. Anger is metal, but more so alternative metal or even nu-metal when compared to the early Metallica thrash sound.All that said, undoubtedly, Metallica were particularly influential in shaping the sound of modern metal. But the band found a big enough following that, by Load (and even somewhat starting with 1991's self-titled ""Black Album"" — think ""Nothing Else Matters""), the act was recording bonafide rock songs meant for the masses.Rock vs. Metal – What's the Difference?Still, while Metallica's music may have rock influences — and they have, as we've shown, ""gone rock"" at some points in their carer — they are primarily recognized as a metal band.Steve Allen, Getty ImagesMetallica in 1990 (Steve Allen, Getty Images)loading...But, to be pedantic, heavy metal wouldn't exist without rock music. And many of Metallica's influences come from the rock world and beyond — not always metal.Metal HistoryWithin the annals of music history, rock played a pivotal role in the evolution and development of metal. While the exact origin of heavy metal is hard to nail down, it emerged as a distinct genre in the late 1960s and into the '70s, drawing inspiration from various influences that included rock.Rock laid the groundwork for metal by pushing the envelope regarding distorted guitars, loud drums and powerful vocals. And as rock evolved, metal came forth. Think Chuck Berry to The Beatles to Led Zeppelin to Black Sabbath. That's the (very simplified) continuum that led to metal.Come to think of it, a band such as Black Sabbath represented the turning point in metal's development. With Sabbath's heavy guitars and ominous lyrics, their 1970 debut LP often is called the first ""true"" heavy metal album.Robert Mora, Getty ImagesMetallica in 2003 (Robert Mora, Getty Images)loading...Other bands, such as Judas Priest and Deep Purple, also contributed to metal's development. And Sabbath, Priest and Purple have all seen shout-outs from Metallica as substantial influences on their music — alongside classic punkers such as the Misfits and hard-rockers such as Thin Lizzy.Metallica Are Metal, But Not All the WaySo is Metallica rock or metal? With everything we've covered here, we hope you have gained a better appreciation of the question. Again, it's not so cut and dry. If someone says that Metallica are all-the-way metal, another person could make a convincing argument that it's not quite the case.But whether Metallica are rock or metal — or hard rock or heavy metal, however you want to put it — it isn't that important. The importance lies in the feeling Metallica's music gives you — then, now and forever. Whether it's the blistering thrash of Master of Puppets or the '90s rock of Load, the significance of Metallica's music is within the listener.So, what do you think?

Loudwire;Randy Blythe Says Social Media Lets People Ignore Facts;The Lamb of God vocalist addressed the issue.;"Lamb of God's Randy Blythe recently opined that social media is assisting in fostering ignorance, the heavy metal musician speaking to the rise of ""alternative facts"" and an apparent decline in objectivity.He said social media helps us ignore the facts.The Lamb of God vocalist conveyed as much on a new episode of Sing for Science, a podcast that puts musicians and scientists together for probing discussions. On Jan. 17, Blythe appeared on the show alongside social psychologist Dr. Tony Lemieux to talk about the social media problem as well as identity politics, intergroup conflict in America, pathways to radicalization, mob psychology and more.Listen to the episode near the bottom of this post.""Everyone's interpretation of reality is subjective,"" Blythe said. ""But there is an objective reality. And that appears to have been thrown out the window.""The Lamb of God frontman continued, ""I think when people are presented with facts that go against the system of beliefs they've constructed around this identity around their political beliefs, they don't stop and go, 'Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.' I think they experience extreme cognitive dissonance. And the way that they deal with that is just to ignore the facts.""He added, ""We've seen that a lot lately: 'That didn't happen,' 'I never said that.' Blah, blah, blah. It's like, yes — you did. These are easily provable things. Veracity is important; it does exist. But lately, it seems to have been thrown out the window. And I certainly think social media has helped push that forward.""Such behavior has manifested in science denial, Blythe argued, especially in a global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic that's seen a significant anti-vaccine movement emerge.""One thing we've seen with the coronavirus pandemic that has been problematic is that because the science on this is new and it's imperfect, and science is a process, it grows,"" the vocalist said. ""When you get additional knowledge, additional data to analyze, you gain more understanding.""But Blythe cautioned, ""Science doesn't have all the answers at all times — it's a process. That being said, I never thought I'd see the demonization of science that I'm seeing right now.""The Lamb of God vocalist often talks on important but controversial topics. In the past, he's underscored mask wearing, spoke to the removal of Confederate U.S. monuments and urged people not to cast judgement so quickly.Lamb of God's latest, their self-titled eighth album, arrived last year.

Loudwire;FFDP's Chris Kael Recalls 2020 Relapse, Is Now Sober Again;Stay strong, Chris Kael.;"Five Finger Death Punch bassist Chris Kael has been open about his struggles with addiction and the benefits sobriety has had on his life. He did relapse with alcohol more than a year ago amid the pandemic, and found continued support through recovery meetings over Zoom, the 12-step program and from his sponsor.In an interview with Jason Rockman of The Rockman Power Hour, Kael, who joined Five Finger Death Punch in 2010, revealed that Feb. 3 of this year would have marked the fourth anniversary ""were it not for a mishap over the pandemic.""""I remember I went to a concert and I was trying to do… I was, like, 'All right. I fell off the wagon. I've been back on the wagon. I'm going in. I'm gonna try to control drinking this time. I'm gonna allow myself to have two. And if I do two, cool.' Nope. Did three. Haven't had a drink since. I said, 'I can't do it.' Even trying to limit myself to two, I couldn't do that,"" the bassist went on (transcription via Blabbermouth).While it was that mishap that ultimately led to Kael returning to a sober lifestyle, he revealed that ""it was much worse before that"" in August of 2020. ""Post-breakup, post-being in a house by myself, it was not good,"" he said of that situation. ""So as I turned to not wanting to feel for a little while… Now, [I'm] back to it again — I'm doing my meetings, doing all the stuff, working with my sponsor, working the steps and all that stuff now.""Elsewhere during the interview, the Five Finger Death Punch bassist recollected his decision to enter rehab, and how he only told his wife, his parents and a friend who has been sober for 20 years and drove him to the treatment facility.Self-accountability is also something Kael admitted he has become better at in recent years. ""I think I'm out from under that rock at this point,"" he said of his past need to have others keep a watchful eye over him, ""But collectively, we do the groups, we do our meetings — all kinds of stuff. So I still have that support system — even tighter support system. My God, [during] the pandemic, I did more meetings in Zoom than I ever did before the pandemic.""""Obviously, COVID was awful, but if you look for the silver lining to things, you can turn a negative into a positive if you just clear your mind, look around and take a full scope of what's going on and just really continue to do the right thing,"" Kael affirmed.Watch the full interview in the video below.Things are set to begin heating back up for Five Finger Death Punch, who will make one U.S. festival appearance this year before heading to Europe for a series of tour and festival stops through mid-summer.

Loudwire;10 Metal Bands From the '80s That Thrived in the '90s;Grunge didn't stop these bands.;"The 1990s grunge boom didn't quash everything else in the rock sphere, especially not metal. Though Nirvana and others pushed the '90s buzz for Seattle-derived alt-rock to ubiquity, many a metal band formed the decade prior was just getting started.And grunge didn't stop them.The oft-repeated narrative is that Nirvana's breakthrough single, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" and its parent album, Nevermind — they emerged successively in September 1991 — signaled the death knell for metal, especially the hair metal that spent the '80s burning up Hollywood's Sunset Strip.There's truth to that tale, but the view is really more from a music industry perspective than a listener's.Record execs were chasing the latest trend, which by 1992 was all grunge, and signing Nirvana soundalikes to try and capitalize. Perhaps listeners who only toed the company line were finished with metal, but it's not like it suddenly stopped being popular.The success of Metallica's ""The Black Album,"" released a month before Nevermind, should be enough to dispel any notion that metal went quiet. But hey, we're here all day. Other bands who started in the '80s but made their biggest splash in the '90s include artists in death metal (Cannibal Corpse) and thrash (Slayer), alt-metal (Deftones) and groove (Sepultura).So what do you think? Did grunge end metal's dominance in the '90s? Or was it all just marketing hype? Can you think of any metal bands from the '80s that flourished in the '90s?

Loudwire;Dave Grohl Annoyed as James Corden Butchers Foo Fighters Songs on Keyboard;Watch the uncomfortably humorous interpretations.;"Dave Grohl has likely heard numerous covers of his music over the years, and likely his patience has been tried with some of them. But any of those may pale in comparison to what went down with the musician was a guest this week on The Late Late Show With James Corden.If uncomfortable comedy is your thing, then you'll love the cringy segment in which Corden played songs on keyboard for his guests that they had to guess. But the catch of ""James That Tune"" is that Corden has zero idea how to play the keyboard, leaving Grohl and fellow guest Hilary Duff to suffer through the uneasy segment.To start the segment, Corden tests out several keys trying to figure out how to present the song he's going to play until Grohl can no longer take the noodling around, shouting down the host to ""Just play the fucking song, man.""As Corden fumbles around the keys, Grohl rubs his forehead unamused guessing ""Everlong,"" before Corden revealed it to be ""Learn to Fly.""As Duff and Grohl waited for the next song, she let out a sigh and a bored stare while Grohl remained non-plussed. After an initial pass at the song, Corden told Grohl, ""You .... should know it,"" then decided it was probably too hard without the drums so he started thumping on drum pad option. ""Can we phone a friend,"" asked Duff, before Corden revealed the song to be ""My Hero.""""This is the last one,"" Corden offered, with Grohl responding, ""Promise?"" But as Corden prepared his final song, Duff and Grohl blew him off discussing finding a SmashBurger franchise in the Valley.Eventually garnering his guests attention, Corden tried to ensure Grohl would get one of the songs by mouthing the lyrics.

Loudwire;Whitesnake Guitarist Misses 4 Shows in a Row, Fans Show Concern;The band's other guitarist had to cover solos for him.;"Whitesnake guitarist Reb Beach has missed four consecutive shows on the David Coverdale-led rockers' ongoing farewell tour that started last month, according to a June 23 report from Blabbermouth.Last week, Beach was said to be ""under the weather.""That's what fellow Whitesnake guitarist Joel Hoekstra told fans online. However, when concertgoers replied with concern after Beach didn't perform with Whitesnake for the following three shows, Hoekstra offered additional updates about his bandmate.See the posts down toward the bottom of this page.On June 14, Hoekstra wrote in a tweet after Whitesnake's performance in Prague, Czech Republic, that night, ""A little last minute stress as Reb Beach was under the weather and I had to cover his solos. But, we gave you our best Prague!! The show must go on!""Two days later, when a fan wrote wondering where Beach was, Hoekstra replied, ""Hopefully back ASAP! Nobody missed him more than me."" A week later, Hoekstra answered about the musician similarly — ""Hopefully Rebel returns immediately,"" he said.In addition to Whitesnake's Prague show June 14, Beach also missed the band's gigs at Belgium's Graspop June 17, a German gig June 19 and a show in Switzerland June 21. Whitesnake is due to play France's Hellfest festival Thursday (June 23).It's unclear what illness may be plaguing Beach, and Whitesnake hasn't said if the musician tested for COVID. Loudwire wishes Beach a speedy recovery.

In its title, Otu posits the rendition as envisioning what it would sound like if the Serj Tankian-led Armenian-American heavy metal band wrote the song instead of Aqua.""This is what Aqua – 'Barbie Girl' would sound like if SOAD made a cover with Toxicity/Steal This Album production,"" the creator adds.Listen to the alternate universe System of a Down number near the bottom of this post.""Barbie Girl,"" Aqua's signature tune and a No. 1 hit in 14 countries, was released in April 1997 as the third single from that year's debut album by the act, Aquarium. In 2011, it was voted worst song of the '90s by Rolling Stone readers.And cover versions of System of a Down songs aren't hard to come by on YouTube, but one with such a unique twist is certainly an attention-catching addition.

Loudwire;Is Barbie's Ken a Metallica Stan? New Doll Comes With Metallica-Styled 'Ken' Belt Bag;Find out where you can get the 'peak patriarchy' Ken doll.;"If you've seen the Barbie movie, you may have caught a subtle nod to one of metal's biggest bands in Ken's wardrobe. While embracing his full patriarchy maleness, Ken dons a rather noticeable belt with his name ""KEN"" spelled out in a lightning-esque silver font against a black backdrop similar to that of Metallica. And now, with the movie doing big box office numbers, the merchandising of a new Ken doll is replicating that look.As SlashFilm notes, the new collectible Ken doll has hit Amazon, retailing for $75. While the Metallica-styled belt is part of the character's eye-catching wardrobe, the doll also comes with a black moto fringe vest with matching fingerless gloves, the gold tone chain to accentuate Ken's belt bag and, of course, the super swaggy faux fur coat with red lining. Ken is also accessorized with a lightning bolt bandana to mirror the belt and he's got high-top sneakers and a silver-tone horse pendant.But the kicker on Ken's potential intentional love of Metallica comes in the doll's packaging. Within the film itself, Ken tires of living in Barbie's shadow, suffering a bit of an identity crisis, and his acting out comes through in his wardrobe. So, for the doll's packaging, it's notable that the Barbie branding has been intentionally crossed out and replaced with the Metallica-esque lightning font Ken branding that adorns his belt pack. You can get your Ken right here through Amazon.But is Ken a Metallica stan? That we're not entirely sure of. While he does rock the belt pack and does play the guitar, his primary musical talent on display in the film is wooing Barbie with his rendition of Matchbox Twenty,'s ""Push."" Not exactly very 'Tallica there, Ken.But, there is actually a hard rock tie to the guitar that Ken uses in the film. Per Guitar World, during promotion for the movie, Ryan Gosling shot a video apologizing to BTS star Jimmin for stealing his black-and-white tassel look at one point in the film and as a peace offering, he wanted to send along Ken's guitar. Gosling then holds up a Jerry Cantrell signature Fire Devil Songwriter acoustic guitar with a few visual alterations, including his name once again in the Metallica-esque font.Could Ken have gotten his hands on Metallica's logo generator shared with fans from the Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct era to create his Ken belt look? The Ken belt pack is visible throughout multiple scenes in the film, as seen in the video for ""Just Ken"" with Ken actor Ryan Gosling singing.Ryan Gosling, ""Just Ken""READ MORE: The 'Barbie' Soundtrack Has Surprise Contributions From Rock StarsLearn more about the new Ken doll and pick one up through Amazon.Subscribe to Loudwire's newsletter or download the Loudwire app to stay up to date with all the latest rock and metal news.What If 20 Iconic Rock + Metal Bands All Had Metallica-Style Logos?Because everyone should have a Metallica-styled logo.";2023-08-15;https://loudwire.com/barbie-ken-doll-metallica-belt-bag/;2023-08-16;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREISBARBIE'SKENAMETALLICASTAN?NEWDOLLCOMESWITHMETALLICA-STYLED'KEN'BELTBAG
Loudwire;Removal of Suggestive Song From Kids Version of Queen's 'Greatest Hits' Causes Outcry;It's the version of the album on the music player Yoto.;"The Queen song ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" has been removed from a new kid-specific version of the classic rock band's Greatest Hits collection available on the children's music player Yoto, causing an outcry regarding the apparent censorship from some internet commenters.Yoto Player is a screen-free kids' audio player for children 3–12. It has a programmable night light and clock, its own podcast and various family-themed music channels. The revised Queen Greatest Hits is available through its app for purchasing content, similar to how iTunes works on Apple.See a handful of commenters' responses below.READ MORE: The Original Song Title for Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Has Been RevealedIt should be noted that ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" has not been removed from any other version of Queen's Greatest Hits, which was first released in 1981 and has since been re-packaged and re-released in various forms all over the world. The song has only been subtracted from the Yoto version.But that didn't stop commenters online from debating the merits of removing the track, with some signaling that the move relates to ideas surrounding themes of ""wokeness"" and ""cancel culture.""Express Newspapers, Getty ImagesQueen (Express / Getty Images)loading...""Signs of an industry eating itself,"" one commenter said. ""If you still listen to big labels/manufactured stars, you're poisoning your mind.""Another seemingly opposed to the track list change added, ""I would have thought 'Fat Bottomed Girls' would have been a song of body positivity.""However, another online offered that it had ""not been cut from Queen's Greatest Hits either to 'appease' nor due to 'woke cancel culture.' It's simply been left off the version on a new kid friendly streaming service for 6-14 year olds. But why let the truth get in the way of another wokeness story.""Should Kids Not Hear It?""It is woke gone mad,"" one purported music industry insider said of the song's removal on Yoto to the Daily Mail (Aug. 19). ""Why not appreciate people of all shapes and sizes like society is saying we should, rather than get rid of it. It's outrageous.""The Telegraph proposed that Universal, Queen's record label, considered the 1978 single written by Queen guitarist Brian May as an ode to voluptuous women to be ""too raunchy"" for younger listeners.Yoto calls the revised Greatest Hits collection ""the ideal introduction to the music of Queen for young music lovers and the perfect soundtrack to kitchen dance parties, road trip singalongs, bedtime air guitar sessions and much, much more.""Response to Queen Greatest Hits on Yoto55 Best Metal Covers of Classic Rock Hits";2023-08-21;https://loudwire.com/queen-fat-bottomed-girls-removed-yoto-greatest-hits/;2023-08-23;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREREMOVALOFSUGGESTIVESONGFROMKIDSVERSIONOFQUEEN'S'GREATESTHITS'CAUSESOUTCRY
Loudwire;10 of the Wildest Locations Bands Have Played Live;From Wall Street to Denny’s, live music knows no bounds.;From their inception, rock and metal performers have been dutifully trying to break the mold and push the boundaries of music and counterculture. They thrive on not doing or saying what they’re told or what’s expected of them. If there’s one thing that rock and metal fans know by now, it’s to expect the unexpected from these acts.We all know about the traditional places bands play at —clubs, theaters, arenas, stadiums, festivals— but this article isn’t going to be talking about any of those places. Although they all have their place and time, they’re far too mainstream for these performers. We’re here to talk about all the off-the-wall places bands have performed.From the steps of Wall Street to Antarctica. From a local Denny’s in California to the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Buckle in as Loudwire takes you on a world tour of the 10 wildest locations bands have played live.Rage Against the Machine on Wall Street Michael Moore filmed the music video for Rage Against the Machine’s track “Sleep Now in the Fire” on the steps of the New York Stock Exchange in 2000.Moore didn’t actually have a noise permit, nor one to film on the sidewalk or street, and reportedly told the band not to stop playing, no matter what happened. He was eventually led away by the NYPD, after which the band attempted to enter the New York Stock Exchange.But they didn’t get very far before the titanium riot doors came crashing down. At 2:52 PM, the Stock Exchange was forced to close its doors.Metallica in AntarcticaDid you know that Metallica became the first band to play on all seven of the Earth’s continents in 2013? Did you know they also did it in a single calendar year?They secured the Guinness World Record by playing in Antarctica. The band performed in a transparent dome in front of 120 scientists and people who won tickets to the event.The hour-long show was called “Freeze ‘Em All” and was performed without traditional amplification due to the continent's fragile environment. Instead, the sound was transmitted to the audience via headphones, silent disco-style.Red Hot Chili Peppers at The Pyramids of Giza in EgyptRed Hot Chili Peppers performed under the stars in front of the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt in 2019 for thousands of fans in 2019. Their 20-song set included the band’s classics such as “Dani California” and “Under The Bridge,” and they also covered “Pyramid Song” by Radiohead.The event marked the Peppers’ entrance into a select group of artists who have have had the opportunity to play at the oldest of the Seven Wonders of The World, joining the likes of Frank Sinatra, Scorpions, Grateful Dead and Shakira.KISS on a Boat at a Concert for SharksKISS also played at a truly wild concert venue in 2019. They performed a mid-sea concert in Australia for great white sharks, plus about eight human fans as part of a promotion for Airbnb to launch their Animal Experiences category.The set list for the maritime concert included the classic “Calling Dr. Love” and low-frequency of KISS’ classic rock was supposed to be a call to some sharkie fans, but, alas, none attended the event. There were some sea lions jumping around according to drummer Eric Singer though.The White Stripes at a Bowling AlleyThe White Stripes performed a special show at a bowling alley in Canada in 2007. The bowling alley was only one of the tiny shows the band played in unusual venues while on their North American tour.They also played a mobile classroom and a moving city bus while in Canada, and turned Tower Records Los Angeles into Icky Thump Records for one show.The set list for the event included “Let’s Build A Home,” and the band apparently bowled a few times during the show (as they should).Foo Fighters on a Truck Flatbed Protesting the Westboro Baptist Church... Twice!When Foo Fighters cruised into Kansas City for a show in 2011, the Westboro Baptist Church decided they must protest (rock ‘n’ roll is the work of the devil, after all).What they didn’t anticipate was Foo Fighters protesting right back at them.The Foos rolled by the protest dressed as the truck stop characters from their “Keep It Clean (Hot Buns)” tour promo and serenaded the picketers.This happened not once, but twice.The second time, Foo Fighters blasted Green Day’s “American Idiot” and Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”Wacko at Denny'sWhat was in the water in 2019?That same year, hardcore band Wacko played an intense show at a local Denny’s in Santa Ana, California, that has become the stuff of legend.The concert, like most metal concerts, got a little rowdy. A 17-year-old promoter, who paid $400 just to rent the space and threw down some extra cash to rent a generator and host an after party, was left on the hook for the cost of the repairs.The band launched a fundraiser for the damages, which came out to be around $1,000. It was reportedly the first show the kid ever booked. We wonder where he is now.Korn on an AirplaneIn 2009, Korn played a set while thousands of feet in the air. They were, of course, in an airplane.Passengers on the flight from London to New York were made up of European MTV contest winners and eight U.S. soldiers who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.The five-song set included “Falling Away From Me” and other hits. Jonathan Davis sang through the airplane’s PA system while James “Munky” Shaffer and David Silveria performed using battery-powered practice amps and a child-size drum set.Chino Moreno Inside a VolcanoDeftones’ Chino Moreno performed solo inside of a volcano in Iceland in 2016, with only an acoustic guitar.That’s right. Not next to, not in front of, inside.Moreno was lowered 400 feet below the ground into the magma chamber of the Thrihnukagigur volcano. Only 20 people were allowed to attend the event that Moreno himself said he was “a little nervous” about. But the volcano hadn’t erupted in more than 4,000 years and had shown no indication of doing so anytime soon.Flogging Molly in a Roman ColiseumCeltic punk band Flogging Molly once performed songs such as “Drunken Lullabies” and “If I Ever Leave This World Alive” in a coliseum from the Roman empire.The gig, which was part of a festival in 2014, took place in Aventicum. Aventicum was the largest town and capital of Roman Switzerland, the remains of which now sit beside the modern town of Avenches.The band even walked through a gladiator tunnel to get onto the stage.Sorry!

Loudwire;The 1975’s Matt Healy Challenges Gallagher Brothers to Reunite Oasis - ‘Grow Up!’;Don't look back in anger.;"What's the story? The 1975's Matt Healy wants Oasis' Gallagher brothers to end our collective mourning of their glory and get back together. The in-fighting between Noel and Liam made headlines during their hit-making tenure, eventually leading Noel Gallagher to exit the band in August of 2009, and in the time since all pleas for a reunion have been rebuffed. That, however, hasn't stopped Healy from joining the chorus of those calling for an end to their divide.Healy was appearing on the CBC's Q With Tom Power (as seen below) when he ventured off his own band's harmonic history to call out Oasis as an example of a band that should still be together.When asked what he was most proud of concerning his band, Healy commented that they, as men, had ""mediated tensions by being very tactile, very open and very silly."" He then turned the discussion to acts who he felt ""got so serious"" about something that he viewed as not being ""that complicated.""“What are Oasis doing?” he commented. “Can you imagine being in potentially – right now, still – the coolest band in the world, and not doing it because you’re in a mard with your brother?” ""Mard"" is slang for ""a tantrum.""""I can deal with the dressing like they're in their 20s and being in their 50s, but acting like they're in their 20s, they need to grow up,"" he continued. “They’re men of the people, and they’re sat around in, like, Little Venice and Highgate, crying over an argument with their brother. Grow up! Headline Glastonbury! Have a good time! Have a laugh!”Healy then continued his point, weighing in on the brothers' respective solo efforts. “There’s not one kid, not one person, going to a High Flying Birds gig or a Liam Gallagher gig that would not rather be at an Oasis gig,"" stated Healy, adding, ""There's not one person that's there going, 'You know what? I loved Definitely Maybe but my favorite thing is Noel Gallagher's fucking High Flying Birds. Do me a favor. Get back together, stop messing around. That's my public service announcement for today.""Earlier this month, Noel Gallagher commented that ""you should never say never,"" where an Oasis reunion is concerned, though adding that an ""extraordinary amount of circumstances would have to happen"" for it to take place. Soon after those comments, Liam Gallagher shared on social media that Noel had been on the phone begging his forgiveness and wanted to meet up.

Loudwire;Travis Barker a 'Proud' Dad After Son Landon's First Hip-Hop Performance;The 18-year-old is known as OTG Landon.;"Travis Barker said he was a proud dad after his 18-year-son Landon Barker's first public concert as a hip-hop artist last week.Landon performs and records as OTG Landon, meaning he's ""on the grind."" The young musician first started releasing R&B-tinged rap tunes in 2018.After the show, Travis — blink-182's drummer and a frequent hip-hop collaborator — shared a photo of him embracing Landon onstage. ""Proud of you son,"" Travis said.See the pic near the bottom of this post, followed by some examples of OTG Landon's music.The inaugural OTG Landon gig took place at The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, Calif., last Saturday (Feb. 26). Barker brought his fiancée Kourtney Kardashian to the show, according to E! News. The drummer's 16-year-old daughter, Alabama Barker, also attended, per The Sun.Landon performed a short set on the bill headlined by the rapper Chri$tian Gate$ and featuring further support from the artist Slush Puppy. A concert review on ECHO noted, ""Landon Barker performed his very first show and everyone went wild for his set. He brought out his friend Jaden Hossler as well as his father, Travis Barker. His set was filled with emotion and showed that he is able to perform a show and captivate an audience.""Landon's first hip-hop single, ""Don't Need Her,"" emerged in October 2018. It was followed by subsequent singles ""Trust,"" ""Im Sorry"" and ""Holiday."" So far, there's no word yet on a full album release.As a small child, Landon appeared alongside his father, sister and mother, Shanna Moakler, on the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers in 2005–2006. Travis and Kardashian revealed their engagement last October after going public with their relationship earlier that year.OTG Landon, ""Don't Need Her"" Music VideoOTG Landon, ""Holiday"" Music Video12 Rappers Inspired by Rock Music";2022-03-01;https://loudwire.com/travis-barker-son-landon-hip-hop-artist-proud-dad-otg/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETRAVISBARKERA'PROUD'DADAFTERSONLANDON'SFIRSTHIP-HOPPERFORMANCE
Loudwire;Red Hot Chili Peppers' John Frusciante Details Songwriting 'Faceoffs' With Flea;This Red Hot Chili Peppers tradition comes with weird faces.;"John Frusciante, returning guitar hero of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, is shining some light on his songwriting process with the band. He says he and bassist Flea will often settle things with a ""faceoff"" when they write songs together.Frusciante tells Guitar World that the goal of their ""faceoff"" was to challenge each other to come up with better music.""Flea and I, we’ve always done these things called ‘faceoffs.’ If we’ve been jamming and maybe we’ve got a good verse that we came up with, but it needs another section, in the old days we used to literally put our foreheads next to each other and give each other kind of a mean look. And then it would be, ‘Okay, I’ll go outside. You can stay here.’"" A little like two sumo wrestlers stomping before the battle begins, eh?Frusciante continues: ""We’d go in separate rooms, and I’d write a section and Flea would write a section. We’d both attempt to write a chorus or a bridge or whatever it was, and then we’d come back into the room and one guy would play everybody his part, the other guy plays everybody his part, and one of them makes it into the song. Or sometimes both of them made it into the song.""On ""The Great Apes"" from the new album Unlimited Love,  Frusciante says Flea was the driving force.“(That song) was something Flea brought in. In the chorus, the guitar part I play is just what his bass line brought out of me... I’ll tell you a little studio trick that we did on this one, because it sounds like I’m doing something more amazing than I actually am. At the outro, Flea and I do this switch. For most of the song, during the chorus I’m playing the melody we’ve been talking about and Flea’s playing the chord changes. But when it goes to the outro, I’m playing Flea’s chord changes and he’s playing my melody. And somehow it sounds more bass-y, by the way, when I start playing the chord changes!""Sounds more Face/Off than ""faceoff.""  Hear the switcheroo below.Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""The Great Apes""Frusciante also implies (but doesn't go into detail) that new song ""Veronica"" was constructed in part due to a ""faceoff.""Sharing how he came up with the structure, “I’m a big fan of tempo changes. It’s one of my favorite things about Black Sabbath – their first four records have all these tempo changes that take place within the same song. Another example would be Some Velvet Morning by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra or We Can Work It Out by the Beatles.""He continues, “I thought, ‘That’s something we don’t have on any of our songs – a chorus that’s a completely different feel and tempo than the verse. And that became the object of Veronica. The verse is in 4/4, but the chorus has a triplet feel.""“Another thing about the song is that wawawawow kind of filter effect in the verse. Some people probably think it’s a guitar effect, but it’s actually my modular synthesizer,"" he adds, before concluding, “And we did all these backwards reverb treatments, sometimes on one instrument, but sometimes on the whole band, to make those tempo changes seem even more fluid.

Loudwire;Evan Rachel Wood Responds to Manson Defamation Lawsuit on 'The View';'I'm not doing this to clear my name,' the actress said in a lengthy TV interview.;"In advance of the release of Evan Rachel Wood's Phoenix Rising documentary, which chronicles her past relationship with Marilyn Manson and her allegations of abuse that prompted her to later name him publicly as her abuser, the actress opened up about both the film and the defamation lawsuit the industrial musician recently filed against her on an episode of daytime talk show The View.She said the objective of Phoenix Rising, the second part of which premieres tonight (March 15) on HBO, is not to clear her name, but rather to ""protect people"" and ""sound the alarm that there is a dangerous person out there.""Several women have sued Manson (real name Brian Hugh Warner) for sexual assault after Wood initially came forth with her claims of assault and, in speaking about the beginning of her relationship with the musician when she was 19, she explained how the process of grooming works.""In the first place, I was not drawn to him — he was drawn to me,"" Wood affirmed when asked what first drew her to Manson.""He approached me under the guise of work, false promises,"" the actress continued, ""And that is part of the grooming process. He was grooming me the second he said hello. Grooming is when you present a false persona to somebody and you tell them lies to lure them into a false sense of security so that they become vulnerable around you. They start opening up, they start giving up their secrets and vulnerabilities. You're mining information. It's the epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Once they have the information, once they know that you feel safe, they know that the manipulation can start.""Wood also touched on her past suicide attempt at age 22, which took place during her relationship with Manson. ""When somebody aids in the destruction of your self, and you forget who you are, you feel pretty broken and empty,"" she explained and went on to note that suicide was ""another form of escape.""The failed attempt to take her own life was something Wood called a ""turning point"" in her life. ""I'm at the bottom so there's no way to go but up,"" she added before referring to herself as a phoenix rising from the ashes.Wood also noted that the #MeToo movement gave her ""a lot of hope"" now that ""domestic violence has had its day"" and words such as ""grooming and gaslighting"" are coming to the forefront as more people understand the scope and depth of abuse.Still, the actress felt there is still more progress to be made on understanding and dealing with these issues at large.""Society around this issue is so geared around shame and victim blaming and that is by design. Even the way we speak about these things... we're still asking victims the question why they didn't leave. And the fact that we're still asking that question tells me how much work there is to do. Nobody ever asks why the abuser didn't leave. If he was so upset, if he hated you so much... 'Why are you hitting her? Why don't you just leave?' We're programmed to say these things and ask these questions, but we need to start asking different questions,"" Wood demanded.When pressed about the defamation lawsuit Manson filed against her, Wood explained, ""I can't speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared. I am sad because this is how it works. This is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes through. This is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet. This is why people don't want to come forward. This was expected.""Undeterred, the actress went on, ""I'm very confident I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out and this this [lawsuit] is clearly timed before the documentary — there's a reason. Again, I'm not doing this [film] to clear my name, I'm doing this to protect people. I'm doing this to sound the alarm that there is a dangerous person out there and I don't want anybody getting near him. People can think whatever they want about me, I have to let the legal process run its course. I'm steady as a rock.""""I have a platform. I'm privileged, I'm white. I have resources,"" Wood acknowledged before lamenting the more significant hurdles many other survivors of abuse may face, ""...and we should all be alarmed — I have these things in my corner and I'm still struggling.""Manson is suing Evan Rachel Wood for allegedly making false and defamatory claims about him. ""There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year,"" Manson recently shared in an online post. ""Until then, I'm going to let the facts speak for themselves,"" he added, then linking to the details of his current lawsuit against Wood.In his suit, Manson alleges several complaints including intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation per se, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act and impersonation over the internet. His case ultimately argues that Wood and Illma Gore created a conspiracy, using fraud, in order to defame him and profit off of it.Watch Wood's full interview below and, for a detailed series of events regarding the lawsuits against Manson, as well as his legal responses, view the timeline beneath the video player.If you or someone you know is facing abuse, visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline website.

Loudwire;Kirk Hammett's Reason for Not Listening to 'Lulu' Anymore Is Actually Quite Touching;The 2011 album is a collab between Metallica and Lou Reed.;"Metallica's Kirk Hammett recently revealed why he's ""afraid"" to listen Lulu, Metallica's 2011 album with The Velvet Underground's Lou Reed. The collaborative effort received mixed reviews from critics and a negative response from Metallica fans when it emerged.But the initial reception isn't why the Metallica lead guitarist is now reluctant to spin the record.No, it's more out of a sentimental reverence for the material and for the album's lead vocalist, Reed. The late rocker, who died in 2013, not only led The Velvet Underground but was a challenging solo artist. And several years ago, David Bowie, another late rock icon, wrote Reed a letter praising Lulu.It was a commendation Hammett won't soon forget.""That was one of the highest compliments I ever got as a musician and artist,"" the Metallica member tells NME in an interview last week (June 17). ""It was an incredible honor working with Lou Reed, and I loved the Lulu album.""Guitarists James Hetfield (L) and Kirk Hammett of the US band Metallica perform on the Helviti stage at the Heavy Metal Rock Festival Copenhell in Copenhagen, Denmark, on June 15, 2022Hammett live with Metallica's James Hetfield.

It was written on paper, and it was such a glowing, grueling appraisal of the Lulu album.""He adds, ""When Lou showed it to me, it brought me to tears, bro! 'Cause I might be some heavy metal guy, but Lou Reed and David Bowie made tons of great music that has been a huge inspiration to me over the course of my life.""However, Hammett confesses it's ""hard for me to listen back to Lulu because it brings me back to that time. Thinking about working with Lou and soaking up his vibe. It became a very emotional album for myself, and I'm afraid to listen to it!""On Lulu, Metallica provide the muscular musical backing to 10 obtuse lyrical pieces written and performed by Reed on vocals.

Loudwire;Best Rock + Metal Cover Songs of 2023 (So Far);We've got it covered.;"Looking for the best cover songs of 2023? We've got you covered, as we've sifted through countless hard rock and metal covers that have spooled out over the first portion of 2023 to determine the best so far.We've got faithful nods to some classic tracks, including Classless Act covering David Bowie, The Dollyrots doing Divynyls and Powerwolf powering through an Alice Cooper classic. We've got intriguing reimaginings including Falling in Reverse and Tarja turning Papa Roach and Linkin Park favorites into piano ballads. And we've got a hit duet between Daughtry and Lzzy Hale showing their pipes stand up to the test of Steve Perry's vocals on Journey's ""Separate Ways.""READ MORE: 40 Best Cover Songs By 40 Rock BandsWhat else made the list? Did you ever expect to see rapper T-Pain on here? Are you a little surprised a Pearl Jam favorite sounds great as a bluegrass song? Let's dig in as we showcase the Best Rock + Metal Cover Songs of 2023 (So Far) in the list below.A Killer's Confession, ""Roots Bloody Roots"" (Sepultura)The Waylon Reavis-led band stays fairly faithful to the original Sepultura metal classic, leaning heavier into a pulsing guitar low-end than the tribal drumming that populated the original. Like many covers, this one was done out of respect. Reavis commented, “In my humble opinion, I feel this is the best tribute I can give to Sepultura and Max Cavalera as a thank you for everything they have given me as a listener throughout the years. Sepultura is one of the reasons I wanted to become a singer/songwriter. I wanted to do them justice by adding a flavor with a new sound, but staying true to what the song is.”Original Version: LISTEN HEREBlack Veil Brides Featuring VV, “Temple of Love” (Sisters of Mercy)Not only do Black Veil Brides and Ville Valo make an interesting tour bill this summer, but the two acts managed to find the perfect song and band to cover that falls right between their sounds. The darkly danceable gothy Sisters of Mercy classic “Temple of Love” gets an aggressive update courtesy of BVB and VV. Black Veil Brides’ Andy Biersack confesses, “The very first song I heard by SOM was the ‘92 version of ‘Temple of Love’ and I became obsessed with their entire catalog.” Supposedly the band had been waiting for the right time to cover it, and when the tour with Ville Valo came up, the time finally arrived.Original Version: LISTEN HEREBlood Command, “Heaven Is a Place on Earth” (Belinda Carlisle)Part punk, part metal, part deathpop, it’s a little hard to put a finger on Norwegian outfit Blood Command, and even more so when they drop an unexpected cover of Belinda Carlilsle’s ‘80s pop hit “Heaven Is a Place on Earth.” Apparently the love extends beyond the kitschy cover, with the band also taking on Carlisle’s “Leave a Light on for Me” earlier this year as well. The Blood Command version stays true to the original arrangement, but leans heavier on synths, drums and chugging guitar to amp up the bubbly energy.Original Version: LISTEN HEREBrass Against featuring Samuel Hope, “Hey Man Nice Shot” (Filter)Brass Against have put themselves on the map, using horn sections to recreate some of rock’s biggest hits. 2023 has seen them take on Soundgarden and Radiohead, but our pick here is Filter’s “Hey Man Nice Shot,” using the horns effectively in building the tension that the Richard Patrick-led band did so well on the original. Bringing in Samuel Hope for vocals was a solid choice, too, given how signature those Patrick-scream vocals are.Original Version: LISTEN HEREClassless Act, “Starman” (David Bowie)Rising rockers Classless Act have often felt like a throwback to some of the classic rock bands, so they embraced the music of one of their musical forefathers earlier this year with a cover of David Bowie’s “Starman.” Inspired by the Bowie documentary Moonage Daydream, singer Derek Day and the band put their stamp on the Bowie classic. They also released a cover of the Bowie-penned Mott the Hoople favorite “All the Young Dudes” as well.Original Version: LISTEN HERECliffdiver, “Oh Bondage, Up Yours!” (X-Ray Spex)Absolutely fierce! Cliffdiver take the 1977 X-Ray Spex favorite “Oh Bondage, Up Yours!” and give it even more attitude — if that’s possible. “It’s the best kind of ridiculous and so humbling to imagine that our little project could be a part of reintroducing a whole new album to X-Ray Spex and a deeper look into the history of women, especially women of color - in punk and alternative music,” says the band. “There’s really no better time for it. As we descend into the capitalist hellscape humanity has created, the message at the heart of the song just becomes more relatable. I think we all need this now.” Turn it up and rock it out.Original Version: LISTEN HEREDaath featuring Dan Sugarman + Rafael Trujillo, “The Philosopher” (Death)Daath / Death …. They’re not that far apart, and even less so now with Daath taking on the Death classic, “The Philosopher” earlier this year. Pulling in Ice Nine Kills’ Dan Sugarman as well as Rafael Trujillo, the band does their best to pay homage to the pioneering heaviness of Chuck Schuldiner. The band’s Eyal Levi says, “It's insane to think that it's been 30 years since I first saw the music video for ‘The Philosopher’ on Headbanger's Ball. I loved the song then and I love it now. This is our attempt to honor Chuck's legacy and massive contribution to extreme metal."" Jesse Zuretti added, ""Chuck and Death paving the way for future extreme metal bands — the best way to pay tribute is to play.""Original Version: LISTEN HEREDaughtry + Lzzy Hale, “Separate Ways” (Journey)Steve Perry had THAT voice, one of the ‘70s and ‘80s most powerful rock singers while fronting Journey. Now fast forward to 2023, when two of rock’s most powerhouse vocalists have united to take on the Journey classic “Separate Ways (Worlds Apart).” Halestorm’s Lzzy Hale joins Chris Daughtry and his band to give the song a cover worthy of the original. It’s also become a rock radio hit, climbing to No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock Chart.Original Version: LISTEN HEREThe Dollyrots, “I Touch Myself” (Divynyls)Though a major charting band in their native Australia, Divinyls are primarily known for their 1990 single “I Touch Myself” in other parts of the world. The song gets a very well done, faithful update in 2023 courtesy of The Dollyrots. You might have missed this one as it was a b-side for the band’s new single “Hey Girl,” but as far as covers go, this is one of the better ones you’ll hear this year.Original Version: LISTEN HEREDope + Drama Club, “Love Song” (The Cure)There’s a lot of love for The Cure this year, with Dope’s contribution coming in the form of a darkly rocked out cover of “Lovesong.” The track actually pairs Dope with Drama Club and features a haunting synth part giving way to an aggressively heavy wall of guitars, giving the song a fresh overhaul.Original Version: LISTEN HEREDrain, “Good Good Things” (Descendents)Drain have been turning heads with their own music this year, but one of the tracks from their Living Proof album is actually a cover song. That would be “Good Good Things,” originally done by the punk icons Descendents. Keeping fairly true to the original, it remains a driving, tension-filled punk song that varies a bit in vocal range beyond the Descendents version.Original Version: LISTEN HEREElectric Callboy, “Everytime We Touch” (Cascada)Who saw this one coming? Electric Callboy dug into the mid-2000s for the international dance pop hit “Everytime We Touch” from Cascada to cover. And initially it feels like they didn’t vary too far off the original …. But then the guttural vocals and heavy chugging riffs kick in. There’s no denying it’s catchy.Original Version: LISTEN HEREEva Under Fire, “War Pigs” (Black Sabbath)Here we have the first of two Black Sabbath “War Pigs” covers, each having their own fresh take on the song. Rockers Eva Under Fire lean into the swing of the open, before singer Eva Marie lets loose with a powerful vocal performance. The band doesn’t vary too far off the original, but the musicianship and vocals definitely shine making this a pretty strong cover.Original Version: LISTEN HEREFall Out Boy, “We Didn’t Start the Fire” (Billy Joel)You can call it a cover, but it’s more of a reimagining. Fall Out Boy took the idea and music of Billy Joe’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” and then updated it with lyrics reflective of what’s happened since the song’s original 1989 release. The group didn’t try to keep it chronological, but did shout out such headline making items as Rodney King, the Oklahoma City bombing, Kurt Cobain, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Obama, Qanon, Y2K, Brexit and Tiger King. Definitely an interesting exercise.Original Version: LISTEN HEREFalling in Reverse, “Last Resort (Reimagined)” (Papa Roach)It’s hard to imagine anyone else doing “Last Resort,” but Falling In Reverse’s Ronnie Radke took on the challenge, turning the song into an emotional power ballad that really tapped into the raw lyrics that Papa Roach’s Jacoby Shaddix initially delivered. Shaddix gave his blessing to the song, and initial reaction was mostly positive as the video for the track shot up to No. 3 on the YouTube chart.Original Version: LISTEN HEREGhost, “Phantom of the Opera” (Iron Maiden)It’s shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that Ghost’s Tobias Forge is a fan of Iron Maiden, so when it came time to do a covers EP for 2023, one of the entries was a pretty spot on take on the Iron Maiden classic, “Phantom of the Opera.” The Ghost version feels a little more synthy, but also has more of a fleshed out instrumental sound.Original Version: LISTEN HEREPaul Gilbert, “Man on the Silver Mountain” (Rainbow)Guitar great Paul Gilbert had a solitary muse for his 2023 album — Ronnie James Dio. The musician was known for his work with Rainbow, Dio and Black Sabbath, and it’s the Rainbow years that get featured on our pick, “Man on The Silver Mountain,” from The Dio Album. The instrumental cut falls in line with the great guitar playing from the original song.Original Song: LISTEN HEREHave Mercy, “1979” (Smashing Pumpkins)Baltimore rockers Have Mercy take the strummy backing of the classic Smashing Pumpkins song “1979” and lean into heavily, turning it more hypnotic and dreamy in nature with a Dave Grohl-esque lead vocal.Original Version: LISTEN HEREImperial Triumphant, “Paranoid Android” (Radiohead)The experimental side of Imperial Triumphant is in full effect on their unexpected cover of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” from the OK Computer album. The band has done a great job of putting their stamp on it, at times seeming almost unrecognizable from the original. This version features doomy guttural vocals layered over the top of crushing heaviness and pieces of the Radiohead original. It’s a definite headphone journey to get lost in.Original Version: LISTEN HEREIron Horse, “Better Man” (Pearl Jam)Pearl Jam, bluegrass? Well, no, but bluegrass outfit Iron Horse recorded a full album of Pearl Jam covers for the “Pickin’ On” compilation series. One of the highlights of the record is “Better Man,” which makes a pretty smooth transition with the members of Iron Horse rocking out the song on mandolin, guitar, banjo and stand-up bass.Original Version: LISTEN HEREMidtown, “Know It All” (Lagwagon)Rather than record a new album, the reunited Midtown decided to go the covers EP route and one of the highlights of that set was the group’s excellent cover of Lagwagon’s “Know It All.” If this doesn’t take you back to a mid-2000s vibe, I’m not sure what will. “It’s a lineage – where Midtown comes from and what shaped us as artists and people,” says vocalist-bassist Gabe Saporta. “We wanted to shine a light on our influences, and keep those influences alive.”Original Version: LISTEN NOWOkkultist, “Sixpounder” (Children of Bodom)Here’s another cover that came about through reverence for a particular artist, as Okkultist shared their admiration for Children of Bodom’s late leader Alexi Laiho while covering “Sixpounder” for their O.M.E.N. album. “We all decided it was necessary to create this tribute, not only song-wise but visually as well, as a gesture of thankfulness to a man who opened so many doors of creativity and technicality, who has inspired so many of us, and who will continue to inspire, throughout the years,” said the band.Original Version: LISTEN HEREOmnium Gatherum, “Maniac” (Michael Sembello)Omnium Gatherum covering an ‘80s dance favorite was not on our 2023 Bingo card, but here we are. There must be something about that “steel town girl on a Saturday night” that appealed to the band, as they took the Michael Sembello hit from the Flashdance soundtrack and turned it into what amounts to a still danceable, but gutturally heavy cover.Original Version: LISTEN HEREPoppy, “Spit” (Kittie)What will Poppy do next? The multi-faceted artist has shown her affinity for metal in the past, so her taking on Kittie shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. Here, she channels fury, angst and a hell of a lot of energy in her cover of Kittie’s “Spit.”Original Version: LISTEN HEREPowerwolf, “Poison” (Alice Cooper)Once again, we’ve got an artist sharing reverence to an iconic musician. And in this case, Powerwolf delivered a stellar cover of Alice Cooper’s “Poison” in honor of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s 75th birthday back in February. This will be one of the more spot-on covers you’ll hear this year.Original Version: LISTEN HEREWill Ramos, “Chokehold” (Sleep Token)How big of a year is Sleep Token having? It seems like everyone wanted to spotlight their song “Chokehold” on social media earlier this year, including Lorna Shore’s Will Ramos who provided this vocal cover of the track. Ramos has been on the receiving end of viral adulation, so here he gives homage to this year’s breakout band.Original Version: LISTEN HERESabaton, “1916” (Motorhead)What do Sabaton and Motorhead have in common? Both acts have a penchant for songs about history. Given Sabaton’s specific fascination delving into historic wars, their cover of Motorhead’s “1916” was a natural choice.Original Version: LISTEN HERESilent Skies, “The Trooper” (Iron Maiden)Most covers either typically stay faithful or offer some sort of reinvention. In this case, Silent Skies take the Iron Maiden classic “The Trooper” and turn it into a haunting piano ballad, allowing listeners to fully immerse themselves in the powerful lyrics.Original Version: LISTEN HERESkald, “Du Hast” (Rammstein)Great music breaks down language barriers. Case in point, the German-language ‘90s hit “Du Hast” from Rammstein has been given a 21st Century update by French Nordic folk collective Skald. And trust us, it doesn’t lose any of the catchiness or ferocity, even with some different instrumentation. If anything, it now has some haunting overtones as well.Original Version: LISTEN HERESOM, “Personal Jesus” (Depeche Mode)The oft-covered Depeche Mode favorite “Personal Jesus” gets a fresh remake here courtesy of doom metal outfit SOM. This new version relies heavily on guitar distortion, a chugging and hypnotic backing and dreamy vocals from SOM’s Will Benoit. The band didn’t stop with just “Personal Jesus” either, issuing a full EP of Depeche Mode covers called Faith that includes “Enjoy the Silence,” “Policy of Truth” and “Never Let Me Down Again.” “There’s a curiosity and excitement around this collection of music, and the experience of this EP finding its place in the dark magical world of Depeche Mode has been really heartening,” said Benoit.Original Version: LISTEN HERESquid Pisser Featuring Arrow Dewilde, “Marching for Trash” (Crucifucks)Squid Pisser are channeling their inner punkness with their cover of the Crucifucks’ “Marching for Trash” and inviting Starcrawler’s Arrow De Wilde to take part in the fun. This one deserves to be played loud, embracing the chaos and rambunctiousness.Original Version: LISTEN HEREStatic-X, “Terrible Lie (Nine Inch Nails)Static-X have trafficked in a mix of aggressive rock and industrial beats over the course of their career, and here they’re lifting from a band with a similar aesthetic. Nine Inch Nails broke on the scene in the late ‘80s with “Terrible Lie” from Pretty Hate Machine,and Static-X give it a modern update by upping the tempo and aggression while leaning into the industrial rockness of it all.Original Version: LISTEN HERET-Pain, “War Pigs” (Black Sabbath)Here’s the second “War Pigs” cover on this list and probably one of the year’s most unexpected yet universally hailed covers. It’s rapper T-Pain ditching the auto-tune vocals and showing he’s got some legit pipes as well. By looking at the track listing on his On Top of the Covers collection, you can see he didn’t back down from the challenge, also taking on Journey, Frank Sinatra, Chris Stapleton and Sam Cooke covers. Rock on, T-Pain!Original Version: LISTEN HERETarja, “Numb” (Linkin Park)There are several covers on this list taking hard rock heavy hitters and scaling them back to haunting piano versions. That’s what you’re getting here with longtime metal vocalist Tarja letting her operatic range soar over a piano and strings version of Linkin Park’s “Numb.”Original Version: LISTEN HERETempt, “We Will Rock You” (Queen)Give it up to Tempt, who bring a whole new vibrance and energy to the Queen classic, “We Will Rock You.” It’s no longer the stomp-clap crowd pleaser, but rather a driving, wailing fleshed out rock anthem with some blistering guitar playing. You’ll never dismiss the original, nor should you, but this cover definitely rocks!Original Version: LISTEN HERETribulation, “Vengeance (The Pact)” (Blue Oyster Cult)Tribulation stay fairly faithful to the proggy, classic rock track “Vengeance” from Blue Oyster Cult, that is until you get into the more guttural vocal approach which makes the song sound all the more sinister as a result.Original Version: LISTEN HERETrivium, “Implore the Darken Sky” (Heaven Shall Burn)If you ever wonder where Trivium came from, you can probably look at Heaven Shall Burn as an early influence. Frontman Matt Heafy says the band was his introduction to a particular brand of metalcore in the early 2000s, explaining, “This fusion of hardcore ethos and metal sounds blew my mind. He adds, “‘Implore the Darken Sky’ is not only my favorite HSB song, but the one that taught me so much about a sound that needed to be injected into Trivium.” Now, some 21 years after the original song was released by Heaven Shall Burn, Trivium have unleashed a ripping and very faithful cover.Original Version: LISTEN HEREVelvet Condom, “Just Like Heaven” (The Cure)As previously stated, there’s a lot of love for The Cure this year, including a new tribute compilation titled Just Like Heaven: A Tribute to The Cure. One of the standouts from that set is Velvet Condom’s take on the compilation’s titular hit. The cold wave outfit inject a bit of a shoegazey vibe into their cover, giving it a fresh vibe in the process.Original Version: LISTEN HEREThe Wildfires Projekt, “Ocean Avenue” (Yellowcard)Pop-punk is so 2003 (and yes, 2023 as well). But The Wildfires Projekt have given Yellowcard’s early 2000s favorite a makeover, turning it into a mid-tempo coldwave lament that remains engaging in its new form.Original Version: LISTEN HEREZulu, “Wait and Bleed” (Slipknot)Los Angeles rockers Zulu stepped up with a Slipknot cover as part of their recent Spotify Singles offering. The band took on the classic “Wait and Bleed,” pushing the needle and waiting for their tops to blow with this chaotic high energy cover.Original Version: LISTEN HEREPLAYLIST: 2023 Rock + Metal CoversListen/follow here.The Best Cover Songs From 50 of Metal";2023-07-07;https://loudwire.com/best-rock-metal-covers-songs-2023-so-far/;2023-07-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREBESTROCK+METALCOVERSONGSOF2023(SOFAR)
Loudwire;The Monkees' Micky Dolenz Suing the FBI to Access Bureau's File on Band;An informant filed a report after seeing their concert in 1967.;"Plenty of musicians spoke out against and wrote songs about the Vietnam War during the late 1960s — it was part of the counterculture. Apparently, the FBI kept a close eye on these artists, one of which were The Monkees. Micky Dolenz, the only surviving member of the band, is now suing the Bureau after they failed to fulfill his request to see a file they have on the band, according to Rolling Stone.The report was filed by an FBI informant in 1967 after they attended a Monkees concert. It was the rockers' very first tour, and ""during the concert, subliminal messages were depicted on the screen which, in the opinion of [informant’s name redacted], constituted ‘left wing intervention of a political nature,'” a portion of the file reads. ""These messages and pictures were flashed of riots, in Berkley, anti-U.S. messages on the war in Vietnam, racial riots in Selma, Alabama, and similar messages which had unfavorable response[s] from the audience.”This part of the file was released to the public in 2011, but Dolenz wants to view it in its entirety. Back in June, the musician's attorney Mark S. Zaid filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see the full FBI file, as well as any others on Dolenz and his Monkees bandmates, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork. However, the Bureau didn't respond within the required 20-business day timeframe, therefore, it's become a lawsuit.“This lawsuit is designed to obtain any records the FBI created and/or possesses on the Monkees as well as its individual members,” the suit explains. “Mr. Dolenz has exhausted all necessary required administrative remedies with respect to his [Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act] request.”Rolling Stone notes that Zaid met Dolenz rather recently, and the attorney suggested they see if the FBI had any files on the musicians without realizing one actually existed.“That just kind of reinforced for me that there was actually something here,” Zaid affirmed. “It’s not just a fishing expedition. I mean, we’re still fishing, but we know there’s fish in the water.”During the 1960s, J. Edgar Hoover was the director of the FBI, and Zaid added that they kept a close watch on the counterculture, so sending an informant to a concert would not have been out of the realm of possibility.“Theoretically, anything could be in those files though,” Zaid stated. “We have no idea what records even exist. It could be almost nothing. But we’ll see soon enough.”Check out the full lawsuit below.The Monkees' Micky Dole... by JasonNewman12 Infamous Rock + Metal Legal BattlesQueue “Winners and Losers” by Social Distortion.";2022-08-29;https://loudwire.com/monkees-drummer-suing-fbi-file-on-band/;2022-08-31;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRETHEMONKEES'MICKYDOLENZSUINGTHEFBITOACCESSBUREAU'SFILEONBAND
Loudwire;Rob Halford: Ghost Are Needed to 'Refocus and Re-energize' Rock Music;Can you guess what his favorite Ghost song is?;"Rob Halford has no qualms about praising newer metal artists, especially when it comes to Ghost. In fact, he recently declared that the Swedish rock band are downright essential to saving rock music.Back in November, the Judas Priest frontman spoke with Revolver about his love for the group. Specifically, he cited “Elizabeth” (the lead single from their debut LP, 2010’s Opus Eponymous) as his favorite song. Why? Because “of its valuable insight [into] the origins of [vocalist] Tobias [Forge]'s singular manner of composition, arrangements and textures, whereby one can sense enormous potential.”He’s got a point, as Loudwire named “Elizabeth” Ghost’s 8th-best song in our 2018 ranking.Halford’s love for Ghost didn’t end there, however, as he also professed that the group are ""crucial"" to revitalizing the genre as a whole:Ghost are an important band on a variety of levels. Rock & roll — I use that term loosely in this context — needs a band like Ghost to refocus and re-energize us. Tobias meticulously created and sought out, firstly, the strength of Ghost musically, and secondly, the crucial visual elements, and both have drawn us into his world of Emeritus mystery and intrigue.His latest remarks shouldn’t be too surprising given that they come roughly seven months after he told Finland’s Chaoszine that he’s overjoyed by Forge’s success. In particular, Halford stated: “I'm so happy for [him], to see his ambition and his dreams become so real. He's worked really hard to make Ghost into this worldwide experience. The guy's a great talent, fantastic performer onstage. . . . The records are wonderful; I've been following his career.""Of course, Halford’s adoration is but one of many reasons for why 2022 has been great for Ghost. For instance, in addition to being Loudwire’s pick for the 2022 Artist of the Year, the band saw “Mary on a Cross” (from 2019’s Seven Inches of Satanic Panic EP) become a viral sensation on TikTok. (It also became Ghost’s most-streamed song on Spotify.) Plus, their latest studio record, Impera, won a 2022 American Music Award for the inaugural Favorite Rock Album category.Clearly, Ghost have been getting a lot of love this year.How do you feel about Rob Halford’s assessment, though?

Loudwire;How Does Chad Gray Feel About Mudvayne Being Called Nu-Metal?;Artists tend to resent labels.;"Artists tend to resent when their band is given a specific label, and nu-metal was one of the most scoffed at genre names for a long time. But how does Chad Gray feel about Mudvayne being called nu-metal?Korn are often considered one of the bands that really spearheaded the nu-metal movement in the mid-'90s, opening the door for later bands such as Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Deftones and Papa Roach to all become part of the same classification. Yes, a lot of the bands that were part of the early nu-metal foundation sounded very distinct from one another, but there were elements that their music shared, especially within the rhythm section of the band and the vocal deliveries.Gray was asked about the nu-metal revival during an interview with Revolver, particularly how he feels about his band falling under the umbrella.""I mean, I don't think we can deny it. We came up in the middle of all that shit. We do have a level of prog to us, and there were definitely some progressive elements. But I think that kind of stopped with the band, because what I brought to it was more... I felt like I had more of that nu-metally vocal. [Greg Tribbett] was into it, too. We were into nu-metal. Like, fucking Matt [McDonough] probably could give two shits, you know what I mean?"" the vocalist responded.While Gray named Metallica, Slayer and Pantera as three major influences on himself and Tribbett musically, he said they were equally impacted by Korn's debut album, Deftones and Machine Head.""I think there were nu-metal elements to us, because [Greg] didn't play leads. The fucking riff in 'Death Blooms,' 'Nothing to Gein.' Any of those early riffs, man, they're very nu-metal-forward, I think. But it basically stops there. It stops with the riff, and it stops with the vocals. Ryan [Martinie] is definitely doing his thing. Matt is definitely doing his thing. And they're not necessarily doing their things together,"" Gray elaborated on Mudvayne's sound.READ MORE: Proof That Gen-Z Has Brought About a Nu-Metal RevivalLater in the discussion, the frontman touched upon the new music Mudvayne has been working on, confirming that they have four songs in the bag that are ""really exciting."" However, they aren't dead-set on releasing any new music unless they know their fans really want to hear it. Otherwise, they'll just continue touring behind the catalog they already have.Mudvayne are currently on the road with Coal Chamber, GWAR, Nonpoint and Butcher Babies. Their next show will take place tomorrow night (Aug 12) in Dallas, Texas, and you can see the rest of the upcoming dates here.How 15 Nu-Metal Musicians Felt About Being Called 'Nu Metal'They should own it.";2023-08-09;https://loudwire.com/how-chad-gray-feel-mudvayne-called-nu-metal/;2023-08-13;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREHOWDOESCHADGRAYFEELABOUTMUDVAYNEBEINGCALLEDNU-METAL?
Loudwire;Queens of the Stone Age Singer Thinks It's 'A Little C--ty' When Bands Don't Play Their Hits;'Acting like a song that a lot of people like is a burden is just a strange reaction to the gift that your fans have given you.';"Yes, it can be a little grueling to play the same song night after night, year after year, but Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme says he doesn't necessarily get the bands that don't want to play their big hit when it comes to their live shows.Speaking with the Tuna On Toast With Stryker podcast, the singer explained, “I understand that I’m always going to play ‘No One Knows’ because I still like playing that song and that’s something that it’s an agreement with the audience. I assume that this is a part of coming here to see us, and here you go.""""When there’s bands that don’t want to play their big song or their big songs, I always think it’s a little cunty to do that,"" adds the vocalist. ""Acting like a song that a lot of people like is a burden is just a strange reaction to the gift that your fans have given you. Seems like an odd reaction.”While Homme shares some sympathy for bands that have one song that overshadows the rest of their music, he still feels that refusing to play that song is not an option. “In the years of doing this, I’ve seen a lot of artists do that at times. Sort of get angry at their own music for doing well,"" he adds, then continues, “Having fans is a cool thing. And they want stuff. And when it comes to playing the stuff that they want, I feel like that’s why this is happening, right? You guys are all here because you want to hear some stuff and also have no idea what’s going to happen. And you need to have that basic food group in order for me to surprise you, too. Surprise requires knowing some constants are going to happen. So I don’t sweat stuff like that.”The singer adds that it's also a bit counterintuitive not to play to the crowd. “A bulk of what we do is heavy and dark, but the end result is that everyone there is participating in trying to have a good time and elevate the situation. It would be strange to deny the stuff that really works to help elevate the situation. It’s like, ‘I need a hammer.’ And there’s one laying here. ‘I’m not gonna use that one! Damn it! I’m not gonna use that one!’ For me, it’s much ado about nothing to say, ‘I’m not gonna play that song again.’ Fuck, I love playing ‘No One Knows.’ It’s great to play.”READ MORE: Queens of the Stone Age Hailed for Glastonbury Show Opposite Elton John's Final PerformanceYou can expect to see ""No One Knows"" as well as several other notable Queens of the Stone Age hits when the band continues their summer touring this week.

Loudwire;School Janitor Going Viral for Amazing Cover of Journey’s ‘Don’t Stop Believin’’;He's also covered Journey's 'Still They Ride' among others.;"You never know where you're going to find the next amazing voice! But word of mouth has started to spread about Richard Goodall, a grade school janitor who performed a cover of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" for an audience of youngsters at a school assembly that mirrored a concert experience.Goodall, who hails from Terre Haute, Indiana, casually stepped up to the mic, using a boombox for musical accompaniment, and showed the kids that he had some amazing pipes. As you can hear in the video shared below, an audible ""Oh god"" response can be heard from an audience member after he sang the first line.And the kids got into it as well, first waving their arms along to the song, then slowly rising to their feet to dance along, eventually providing Goodall with a standing ovation by the end of the video.Goodall posted his first TikTok earlier this month, covering the Lee Greenwood song ""God Bless the USA."" But things started to really take off once he posted the video of himself singing the Journey classic to the school assembly. Shared on Twitter (as seen below) by a poster under the moniker Arlong, the video has surpassed over 16.2 thousand ""loves."" Arlong added in their post, ""Nothing but respect for school janitors, especially ones like this.. People don’t realize how cool students actually become with the janitors. They really were the coolest adults in the building by far.""And Goodall didn't just stop at ""Don't Stop Believin'."" He's also posted a pretty awesome cover of Journey's ""Still They Ride"" (seen below) and ""Stone in Love"" as well as other selections via his TikTok account. He even got a response back on his performance from Journey's original vocalist Steve Perry, who offered ""I love this,"" to which Goodall beamed, ""Love your music, sir!!! Thank you for commenting. This means so much to me!!! Thank you.""According to video posted on his TikTok account, Goodall took part in an open Virtual Call for The Voice, but was not selected to move forward for the show. He later posted, ""Disappointed you bet! For one moment I bought into everyone telling me how great I am but... I’ll continue on. I’m sad I thought 2 million views would make a difference. But I guess I’ll still have to take out the trash at 6am. But that’s what I do. And I’ll continue to do it. Love you all for you positive support.

Loudwire;Why Jonathan Davis Hated Korn Being Called Nu-Metal;He's let go of the resentment now.;"Between the Woodstock '99 documentary series on Netflix and the recent announcement of the Sick New World festival next year, there's been a surge in the popularity of nu-metal over the last few months. Korn were one of the pioneers of the rap-metal fusion, and Jonathan Davis has explained why he initially hated the name of it.While the frontman has come to accept the label in recent years, and has admitted he's proud that his band is known as the one that spearheaded it, he didn't always have such welcoming feelings about being categorized — nor did pretty much any of the other musicians that were too.""For me, we were making Untouchables, and that was when so many bands were coming out and jumping on the bandwagon. Now I don't mind the tag 'nu-metal' — they named an entire subgenre after my band? Holy shit! That's cool!"" Davis told Metal Hammer in a new interview.""But punk-ass, crazy Korn back then, we were like, 'What the fuck? Fuck everyone! We're going to make this insane record. Keep people guessing.' It had become a parody of itself, [like] 'I don't want to be defined like that!'"" he continued. ""Nowadays, I don't care, but back then I hated it. I make the music I make... You don't call Metallica 'some thrash band!' They're fucking Metallica! You don't call the Chili Peppers a funk rock band! They're the fucking Chili Peppers!""Other groups that became associated with the ""nu-metal"" genre throughout the late '90s and early 2000s were Limp Bizkit, System of a Down, Deftones, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Evanescence, Incubus and Papa Roach, among others. All of the aforementioned groups, with the exception of Limp Bizkit, Slipknot and Linkin Park, will perform with Korn at the Sick New World festival in Las Vegas next year.

Well, here to explain is the film’s trailer, which reveals a survivor of the Mean One’s killer rampage decades earlier returns to “Newville” intent on getting revenge for her mother’s murder:The announcement of this project went viral on social media, in very similar fashion to the curiosity around the upcoming Winnie the Pooh horror spoof Blood and Honey. Whether that online buzz will translate to box office or digital rentals remains to be seen, of course. But if these movies do well, there’s seemingly no limit to the beloved childhood classics that couldn’t be spoof.

Loudwire;How Zakk Wylde’s Audition Tape Made Its Way to Ozzy Osbourne;Wylde reveals a few versions of the story.;"Thirty-five years ago Zakk Wylde got a call while pumping gas to join Ozzy Osbourne's band and he's remained at Ozzy's call for years. Here's how Zakk Wylde's audition tape made its way to Ozzy Osbourne.In an interview with Louder, Wylde reveals that he discovered Black Sabbath when his friend introduced him to the band when he was just 11. The first album he listed to was We Sold Our Soul For Rock'n'Roll and was scared at first while listening, but then absolutely loved it.Wylde riffs off a couple of different versions of how he initially got into the band. One fake version is that he got into the band because he was Ozzy's steroid dealer, and gave him half off for being in the band. But the real version is Wylde was playing shows with his band Zyris when someone in the industry, Dave Feld, talked to him about auditioning for Ozzy after a show.Feld asked him, ""You know Jake [E. Lee]'s just left Ozzy's band?"" and they continued to talk about how great it'd be to get a tape to Ozzy. ""But hey, after that, why not coffee with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, right? We don't know these fucking people - I've got their posters, not their fucking phone numbers!""Dave Feld apparently knew Mark Weiss, who did Ozzy's photography, and that is how he got his in. Not long after, he was pumping gas when he got the phone call to join Ozzy's band. Just weeks later, Wylde played his first show (which was an audition) with Ozzy at Wormwood Scrubs prison.Whenever Ozzy first met Wylde he swore that he'd met him before, but it was because Wylde send a Polaroid with his audition tape and that was why he looked familiar according to an interview with 93.3 WMMR. Ozzy asked him to change his pants and make him a ham sandwich during the audition, which Wylde continued to do for him over the years.Ozzy is also how he got the name ""Zakk Wylde"" after he joined the band. Wylde has often felt like the Osbournes are his family. ""Pretty much right from the beginning - they've always treated me amazing,"" says the guitarist who called Sharon 'Mom' and Ozzy 'The Boss.'He says his relationship is about so much more than music, and is ""literally always a phone call away. If they need me to go over and feed the dogs while they're on vacation? No problem. Need eggs and milk?

Loudwire;Rock + Metal Songs About U.S. History;Darker subject matter and heavy music are always intertwined.;Here are 10 rock and metal songs about U.S. history.On July 4, 1776, 13 American colonies that broke away from imperial leadership in Great Britain issued the Declaration of Independence, formally introducing the foundation of the United States government.The nearly 250 years of history that has shaped and defined the U.S. is complex, which is not unique across recorded human history. The fight and struggle for individual freedom is one of the purest human pursuits, and one that is underscored by oppression, tragedy and violence.The songs below mostly represent the more negative elements of the country’s past, both distant and recent. That’s because the stories and events recollected are true, as unkind, embarrassing or as shameful as they may be. We’re also dealing with heavy music, which often confronts harsh realities, underpinned by aggressive music.READ MORE: 10 Metal Songs That Make a Great History LessonOur reality is that war and the fight for equality is a common link amongst people of all nations, even those with the most boisterous declarations of basic human rights for all.We can’t change history — the cold, hard fact is that the events described in these songs are real, uncomfortable and that’s all part of life. Learning how to manage emotions, reflect and hope that we can write new history to show how we as a collective society can progress and find that elusive ideal of world peace is perhaps the biggest lesson we can take away from all this.Sabaton, “Primo Victoria” About: D-Day in NormandyAppears on: Primo Victoria (2005)Known best as D-Day and, more formally, as Operation Overlord, it marks the biggest seaborne invasion in all of history as the Allied powers stormed the beaches of Normandy, France in a 1944 effort to liberate the country from Nazi control. The success of the invasion is one of the most significant turning points of the century’s history.Sabaton, who author songs exclusively about war and in a history buff type fashion, wrote about this event on “Primo Victoria,” the title track to their 2005 debut. It remains one of their most popular songs today.Key lyric: “In the dawn they will pay / With their lives as the price / History’s written today / Now that we are at war / With the axis again / This time we know what will come / 6th of June 1944 / Allies are turning the war / Normandy state of anarchy / Overlord”Anthrax, “Indians” About: Genocide of indigenous people in the U.S.Appears on: Among the Living (1987)The systemic genocide of indigenous people in the now North American territory pre-dates the U.S., going back to the 1600s. Even so, the U.S. maintained the practice, decimating populations and their culture through the early 1900s.One of Anthrax’s biggest songs highlights the savagery at hand while offering an empathetic outlook on the tragedies that have transpired and that people as a whole cannot be defined by geological borders.Key lyric: “Territory, it’s just the body of the nation / The people that inhabit it make its configuration / Prejudice, something we all can do without / The flag of many colors is what this land’s all about”Testament, “The Evil Has Landed” About: 9/11Appears on: The Formation of Damnation (2008)Sept. 11, 2001 was a day that shook the U.S. and many around the world. A terrorist attack executed in inconceivable fashion caused a permanent shift in global relations and tensions. For U.S. residents in particular, it is a defining moment in life where the mere thought of the two hijacked planes being flown into the two World Trade Center towers brings back powerful emotions.On their 2008 album featuring the return of Alex Skolnick and Greg Christian, Testament recall the tragedy with vivid, literal detail while assuring that we will rebuild and come together through it all.Key lyric: “The towers got hit / A steel bird with wings of destruction / As the buildings split / The skyline had been deconstructed”Rush, “Manhattan Project”About: U.S. development of atomic weaponryAppears on: Power Windows (1985)As the world sees it, perhaps nothing defines the U.S. more than war. Boasting the globe’s most powerful and dominant military force of the modern age, the country remains the only one on Earth to have ever dropped a nuclear bomb on another nation. And the U.S. dropped two of them on Japan, one on Hiroshima (Aug. 6, 1945) and the other on Nagasaki (Aug. 9, 1945), each ultimately provoked by Japan’s attack on U.S. military base Pearl Harbor.“Manhattan Project” was the name of the special project in which the U.S., who enlisted nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer (among many others) to develop the world’s first nuclear arms. Rush break down the project into four sections on this namesake song, positing that the world the explosion is another “big bang” moment that establishes a brand new trajectory, referencing the moment regarded as the birth of our universe.Key lyric: “The big bang, took and shook the world / Shot down the rising sun / The hopeful depend on a world without end / Whatever the hopeless may say”Rage Against the Machine, “Killing In the Name”About: Police beatings of Rodney King, resulting Los Angeles riotsAppears on: Rage Against the Machine (1992)“Killing in the Name,” the firebrand track off Rage Against the Machine’s self-titled 1992 debut is a song not so much about a historical moment, but influenced by one and speaks to an even wider issue.In 1991, after a high-speed pursuit, police officers severely beat Rodney King, a Black man, striking him with batons over 30 times, in addition to several kicks and being tased after not appearing to be resisting arrest. None of the four officers tried in court for use of excessive force were sentenced, triggering nearly a week of deadly rioting in Los Angeles as citizens were outraged by the verdict.These events directly inspired the Rage song, which takes the issue further by linking members of the Ku Klux Klan with law enforcement, who seek the position with the aim of abusing their power and oppressing those who are not white.Key lyric: “You justify those that died / By wearing the badge, they’re the chosen whites / Some of those that work forces / Are the same the burn crosses”Fit For an Autopsy, “Black Mammoth”About: Dakota Access PipelineAppears on: The Great Collapse (2017)The Dakota Access Pipeline is an oil pipeline that was the subject of widespread protests as it runs straight through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation Preserve in North Dakota and poses a threat to the safety of local water supplies. It even brought Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe to the front lines of the battle between protesters and “Big Oil”/the federal government.Protecting and managing our natural resources is paramount to the survival of the species, especially as water supplies elsewhere are drying up, which will prompt mass migrations to more hospitable places. And sending the pipeline through the preservation — a patch of land as a sorry consolation for genocide of indigenous people — is, well, patently fucked up.It’s a fitting matter for The Great Collapse, the Fit For an Autopsy album about how shitty we are to our own planet.Key lyric: “Tread on sacred terrain, envenomed and ravaged / The peace upon the plains, seized by the savage / Primitive practices, uproot and vanish / Modern barbarians, new rite of passage”Alkaline Trio, “Prevent This Tragedy” About: West Memphis ThreeAppears on: Crimson (2005)In 1994, three teenagers (Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin) were convicted for the 1993 murder of three boys from West Memphis, Tennessee. It was alleged a Satanic ritual was involved and there has long been debate about credibility of the evidence. After signing a plea in 2011 while still maintaining their innocence, the trio were released from prison.There’s still debate about a wrongful conviction as new DNA testing is sought and Alkaline Trio confront the case on “Prevent This Tragedy” (released before the Three’s release) focusing on the death sentence Damien Echols was handed.Key lyric: “Here we are again with handguns for hearts / They had a master plan, wanted to tear us apart / Nothing to hold, all hope deleted / Our demise has been completed now”My Chemical Romance, “Skylines and Turnstiles”About: 9/11Appears on: I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love (2002)The events of 9/11 triggered different responses and emotions in everyone. While many of those experiences overlap, Gerard Way was able to pull inspiration from tragedy as well. Life is short, as they say, and it’s that notion that dawned on the singer who then felt compelled to start a band as a result.Way was in his early 20s when the hijacked planes struck New York City’s “twin towers,” claiming the lives of nearly 3,000 people. It’s a raw, extreme and shocking thing to process while still learning about the ways of the world at large and Way channeled his emotion into “Skylines and Turnstiles,” a song he wrote immediately after the attack. It prompted him to call up some pals and My Chemical Romance was born.Key lyric: “After seeing what we saw / Can we still reclaim our innocence? / And if the world needs something better / Let’s give them one more reason now”The Doors, “Unknown Soldier”About: Tomb of the Unknown SoldierAppears on: Waiting for the Sun (1968)In a bit more of an abstract way than other songs presented here, The Doors’ “Unknown Soldier” exemplifies the outward symbolism that arose from The Tomb on the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery.It first served as the grave of one unknown World War I service member, erected in 1921, and later as the grave site of a total of three unknown service members with additions in 1958 and 1984. Guarded 24/7, its symbolism has grown to offer reflection on military service as a whole as well as the memory of service members whose remains were never found or identified.This cut from The Doors isn’t about the Tomb itself and takes on a cynical overtones, noting how life at home continues despite the loss of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.Key lyric: “Breakfast where the news is read / Television children fed / Unborn living, living dead / Bullet strikes the helmet’s head / And it’s all over / For the unknown soldier”Body Count, “Black Hoodie” + “No Lives Matter”About: Shooting of Travyon Martin / Black Lives Matter movement in wake of police killing of George FloydAppear on: Bloodlust (2017)Speaking truth to sociopolitical issues and, in particular, racism at large, is not new for Ice-T, which he acknowledges he’d been doing for 20 years already in “Black Hoodie.” The song lays it all pretty bare — that there was no need for Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman to shoot unarmed 17-year-old Travyon Martin after he had already called the police.Since Martin was wearing a black hoodie, Martin appeared suspicious to Zimmerman, who later shot and killed the teen while claiming self-defense. He was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges until Florida’s controversial stand-your-ground law.On the same record, Body Count mock the “All Lives Matter” response to the Black Lives Matter movement, calling out the lazy retort as ignorant and one that dilutes the true issue. This dialogue ripped open after George Floyd was killed by Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, leading to his death.Chauvin and others were convicted for their actions, a verdict that was celebrated by many as it was a rare moment where justice was finally served regarding a matter of extreme police brutality.Key lyrics: “Got on a black hoodie, it’s hood up on my head / I didn’t have a gun so why am I dead? / You didn’t have to shoot me and that’s a known fact / And now I�������m laying face down with bullets in my back” (“Black Hoodie”)“America’s always been / A place that judge my skin / And racism is real as fuck / Ain’t no way to play that off / And in the eys of the law / Black skin has always stood for poo / This is basic shit / They know who they fucking with” (“No Lives Matter”)Iron Maiden, “Run to the Hills” About: Genocide of indigenous people in the U.S.Appears on: The Number of the Beast (1982)Set to a speedy gallop that really invites the idea of being chased/driven out of a territory, this rollicking Maiden track not only highlights the senseless slaughter of an entire people, but also shows how terribly those still alive were treated. The introduction of alcohol to the indigenous tribe members further suppressed them and, amid the bloodshed, sexual abuse and extortion of children also took place.Key lyric: “Soldier blue in the barren waste / Hunting and killing’s a game / Raping the women and wasting the men / The only good Indians are tame / Selling them whiskey and taking their gold / Enslaving the young and destroying the old ”Drive-By Truckers, “The Sands of Iwo Jima” About: The Battle of Iwo JimaAppears on: The Dirty South (2004)The five-week Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945 resulted in casualties in great numbers for both the U.S. and Japan. With superior air support, the U.S. gained control of two airfields in the final year of the Pacific War. It is also the sight of the iconic photo of six U.S. marines raising a flag together over the battle’s rubble.This battle was depicted in the 1949 film Sands of Iwo Jima, starring iconic actor John Wayne.On the Drive-By-Truckers song titled after the movie, the lyrics are centered around the life of a soldier once the war is over and they’ve returned home. Those who served will often attend reunion events, sharing stories and emotions through bonds no ordinary person would be able to comprehend, as the track notes.Both the battle and the film are referenced in a powerful, poetic way.Key lyric: “And I thought about that movie, asked if it was that way / He just shoot his head and smiled at me in such a loving way / As he thought about some friends he’ll never see again / He said, ‘I never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima’”Europe, “Cherokee”About: The Trail of TearsAppears on: The Final Countdown (1986)In 1830, President Andrew Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act, which sought a forced exile of more than 60,000 members of five tribes — Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw and Choctaw — from their native lands to the west of the Mississippi River. The reason? To more easily mine gold. This is known as the Trail of Tears.A non-title track hit off The Final Countdown, the 1986 album by Swedish arena rockers Europe, “Cherokee” demonstrates how far-reaching this piece of U.S. history is.Key lyric: “They lived in peace, not long ago / A mighty Indian tribe / But the winds of change / Made them realize, that the promises were lies”Iced Earth, about half of 'The Glorious Burden'Before Iced Earth leader Jon Schaffer became a traitorous loser who attempted to overthrow American democracy by being among the first to breach the Capitol building on Jan. 6. 2021, he teamed up with former Judas Priest singer Tim “Ripper” Owens (who replaced Rob Halford for a brief spell) on The Glorious Burden.The record is conceptual in nature, each song tackling a different piece of military history, with a handful fixated on U.S. events, including “Declaration Day” (American Revolution), “When the Eagle Cries” (Sept. 11, 2001), “The Reckoning” (revenge for Sept. 11 attacks), “Valley Forge” (Revolutionary War), and the “Gettysburg (1863)” trilogy (Battle of Gettysburg).Nowadays, Schaffer, a professed lifetime Oath Keeper (the militia group whose leader Stewart Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges) is cooperating with the federal government as part of a plea bargain while he awaits his own sentencing.SteamhammerSteamhammerloading...18 Rock + Metal Artists Showing PatriotismThese artists have shown patriotism onstage, in photos and at other events.;2023-07-03;https://loudwire.com/rock-metal-songs-us-history/;2023-07-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREROCK+METALSONGSABOUTU.S.HISTORY

She backed down on the withdrawal and was later inducted, all while threatening to write and release a rock album soon, something she had been wanting to do for a long time.READ MORE: Dolly Parton Says 'I Guess I'm a Rock Star Now' After Receiving Rock Hall Nod""I’ve never thought of myself as being rock 'n' roll in any sense of the word — but I guess they judge it on the music and the influence certain songs have had, and I guess I’ve had songs with other people in that realm.

Loudwire;Maynard James Keenan Picks Best Song to Introduce People to A Perfect Circle;It's not an expected one.;"We already know that Maynard James Keenan thinks the best song to introduce Tool to new listeners is ""The Pot,"" but what about A Perfect Circle? During a chat with BBC Radio 1's Rock Show last year [via Revolver], the singer made his pick.Keenan formed A Perfect Circle with guitarist Billy Howerdel several years after Tool broke into the mainstream, and since their formation, they've released three studio albums and one that was comprised entirely of covers. Despite the popularity of some of the tracks on Mer de Noms (2000) and Thirteenth Step (2003), Keenan's top choice for introducing someone to the band is from their most recent release, 2018's Eat the Elephant — ""The Contrarian.""""Just even the first three songs on Eat the Elephant was a very difficult task to do because it was an exercise in Billy and I showing restraint. It's hard to do a very restrained, focused song with a lot of space. It's actually harder than filling in all the space. Especially with that song because there's a subtlety attached to it and a lot of space,"" Keenan recalled.""It was in a range that's not necessarily comfortable for me, and to maintain character in those unfamiliar spaces is a challenge. And I think Billy, too. He had to not reinvent what he was doing but take a step back and not put forward his first reaction or his second reaction. He had to really dig deep and find how he served that song rather than just bringing Billy Howerdel to that song.""Thus, the challenging aspect of creating the song made it really enjoyable for the frontman.READ MORE: 20 of the Most Eccentric Maynard James Keenan Onstage OutfitsSince the release of Eat the Elephant, Keenan has been busy both with Tool, who released Fear Inoculum in 2019, and Puscifer, whose most recent record Existential Reckoning came out in 2020. Howerdel also put out a solo album in 2022 called What Normal Was, so we don't currently know when the pair plan on writing new A Perfect Circle material at this point.In the meantime, check out ""The Contrarian"" below.A Perfect Circle - 'The Contrarian'The 66 Best Rock Songs of the 2000s: 2000-2009The 21st century started off rocking.";2023-04-21;https://loudwire.com/maynard-james-keenan-best-song-introduce-people-a-perfect-circle/;2023-04-23;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREMAYNARDJAMESKEENANPICKSBESTSONGTOINTRODUCEPEOPLETOAPERFECTCIRCLE

This means a lot to me personally, to go out there and represent those guys and represent the Pantera name. And that's all I'd ever want for me. I don't care about it financially and stuff like that; this, to me, I had to do this.

Loudwire;Glenn Hughes Says He + Eddie Talked About Him Replacing David Lee Roth in Van Halen;Do you think it could've worked?;"Can you imagine what it would sound like if the legendary Glenn Hughes wound up singing for Van Halen? According to the singer/bassist, he and Eddie Van Halen once kicked around that very idea.Hughes' name was evidently brought up when Van Halen were seeking a replacement for David Lee Roth in the mid-'80s. He first rose to prominence as a member of the budding band Trapeze before landing the gig as bassist and co-lead singer in Deep Purple, playing on Burn, Strombringer and Come Taste the Band before thee group dissolved in the late '70s.In the early '80s, Hughes partnered with guitarist Pat Thrall on a one-off Hughes/Thrall record and was battling addiction.In an interview with The Classic Rock Podcast, Hughes recalls chatting with Eddie about the band's need for a successor to Roth and the different paths in life he and the guitarist were on. ""Well, Eddie was newly sober at that time… And we spoke about it. I had no idea. Eddie had been a friend of mine from the beginning,"" reveals Hughes (transcription by Blabbermouth).It doesn't sound like the conversation about Hughes being considered for the Van Halen role went very far. What's likely is that the band probably brought up a lot of different names before the audition stages, casting a wide net to consider all options.READ MORE: Why Sammy Hagar Believes He Made Van Halen Better When He Joined""Look… Wow… Would it have worked? I'm not sure,"" confesses Hughes, who later took an ill-fated gig as Black Sabbath's frontman from 1985 to 1986, singing on Seventh Star, the record that was intended to be a Tony Iommi solo album. His stint with the group was cut short after a fight on the road left him with a broken nose, unable to sing.Regarding the Van Halen opportunity, he wonders, ""Unless I was completely sober — and I've been sober now for 24 years. Yeah, it would have been interesting, wouldn't it? [Laughs] You never know.""Hughes, who will turn 72 on Aug. 21. He's touring with Yngwie Malmsteen this summer, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Deep Purple's Burn.

Nev. Unfortunately, high winds forced organizers to cancel the Day One performances, which understandably resulted in plenty of amusing – if also angry – reactions on various social media platforms.For example, one Facebook user commented, “So now we’ve had Fyre Fest and Wind Fest. I can’t wait to see what happens at Earth and Water fest,” while another wrote: “Feeling sad like i did when i was young ….Maybe this IS the event..!!!”You can see all of the reactions to the official Facebook announcement below:Meanwhile, Twitter responses were just as humorously agitated. One user surmised: “Lol spirit Halloween is probably plotting how to take over when we were young already.” Another person had an edgier take: “’When We Were Young’ cancelled, was it exposed for trying to hook up with a much younger music festival.”Obviously, that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to funny Twitter commentary:You can view all of the replies to the official Twitter post below:Of course, the festival is still scheduled to continue today (Oct. 23), with the line-up including Paramore, My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, Jimmy Eat World, The All-American Rejects, Atreyu and Poppy (among others).However, spectators have been no less sarcastic regarding whether or not Day Two will go according to plan:How do you feel about the inaugural day of When We Were Young being canceled?

Loudwire;It Looks Like Guns N' Roses Will Play Historic Festival for First Time Ever in 2023;Check out the clues!;"A couple of hints fell from the airwaves and the internet this week about one of the world's biggest bands playing one of the world's biggest festivals. Check out the evidence below that points to Guns N' Roses performing at the U.K.'s historic Glastonbury Festival in the summer of 2023.First clue, from Twitter. @eFestivals, which captions itself as the ""the UKs number one festivals website,"" listed Guns N' Roses as TBC. This was noted by @TheGlastoThingy, who tweeted, ""@eFestivals now has both Arctic Monkeys and Guns n Roses as tbc on the Glastonbury line-up page which means they're basically nailed on.""The pic included in @TheGlastoThingy's tweet shows GN'R sandwiched in between Funke and the Two Tone Baby and Harry Styles in the alphabetical listing. In the photo GN'R is scheduled for Saturday, June 24, on the Pyramid Stage.Clue #2. On his SiriusXM radio show ""Three Chords & The Truth,"" GN'R bassist Duff McKagan was riffing about the bands summer plans, talking about how Guns N' Roses was set for a London Hyde Park show in June. Then Duff let's it slip that ""and Glastonbury is going to iconic for us..."" You can check out that audio here.So far, officially, only Elton John has been confirmed as a major headliner for Glastonbury 2023 on the festival's website. Strangely, if the rumors are true, then it would be both Elton and GN'R's first time playing the legendary festival on the Worthy Farm in the British countryside.Check back for more details and see all the announced festivals both in the U.S. and around the world below! 2023 Rock + Metal Music Festival GuideSee what big rock and metal festivals are coming up in 2023!";2023-01-20;https://loudwire.com/guns-n-roses-play-glastonbury-festival-first-time-2023/;2023-01-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREITLOOKSLIKEGUNSN'ROSESWILLPLAYHISTORICFESTIVALFORFIRSTTIMEEVERIN2023
Loudwire;Whatever Happened to the Acts From the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?;Bringing jam to the masses.;"You have to admit, the ‘90s were great for touring festivals. You had a wide array of rock oriented festivals to choose from with Lollapalooza ushering in the touring festival craze, Ozzfest bringing something heavier and Warped Tour serving the punk and skating communities. And then there was the H.O.R.D.E. festival.H.O.R.D.E., which stands for Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere, was founded by Blues Traveler in 1992 as a way to bring greater exposure to the bands in their scene as well as providing a solution to a touring problem they had faced.With amphitheaters often reserved for more commercial acts over the summer, Blues Traveler were interested in finding a way to break beyond the club circuit. Singer John Popper recalled to Guitar World, ""In the summer, we'd all go out and draw maybe one or two thousand people. And there are no places outdoors that small, so we'd have to play indoors, which sucked. Then a couple of us got together and wondered 'What if we all went on tour? If we each drew our usual two thousand people, we might draw enough to fill a big shed (amphitheater). So from the outside, it may have looked like there was this big movement happening, but really, it was just a bunch of bands thinking about how to survive.”From there, calls were put out to several bands who faced a similar dilemma at the time, and the idea to bring together their respective audiences for a concert big enough to fill an amphitheater was born. And, in many ways, this was the type of platform needed to bring attention to a new wave of jam bands that would come to thrive over the next era of music.The first H.O.R.D.E. tour was only eight dates, with four East Coast shows scheduled for July and four shows in the South taking place in August. But, it was viewed as a success and the H.O.R.D.E. festival would continue to grow in future years.But whatever happened to the bands that took that initial chance and bet on themselves to bring this style of music to the masses? Let’s dig in below:Blues Travelerblues traveler, but anyway videoYouTube: Blues Travelerloading...Where Were Blues Traveler Before the First H.O.R.D.E Tour?Though not yet a household name in the pop culture world, Blues Traveler had secured enough clout leading into 1992 to consider launching their own festival. They formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987, releasing their first self-titled album in 1990 featuring the single “But Anyway” and scored a buzz-generating sophomore set titled Travelers and Thieves in 1991. They had also earned support from late night TV host David Letterman who championed them during their appearances on his talk show.Where Were Blues Traveler After the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?Though on a much smaller scale than it would eventually become, the initial H.O.R.D.E. festival run was viewed as a success and it gave the band a bigger platform for future success. They continued to build their following with 1993’s Save His Soul, but it was 1994’s Four album that gave them their commercial radio breakout with the singles “Run-Around” and “Hook.”After 1997’s Straight on Till Morning, the band got sidetracked for a few years. Singer John Popper had emergency heart surgery, then took a hiatus during which he released a solo album. Meanwhile, bassist Bobby Sheehan died of an accidental drug overdose in 1999, and it would be 2001 before they returned with the Bridge album.By this point, H.O.R.D.E. had run its course, but Blues Traveler would remain one of rock’s most consistent bands, with eight more studio albums spooling out over the next two decades.Spin Doctorsspin doctors, little miss can't be wrongYouTube: Spin Doctorsloading...Where Were Spin Doctors Before the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?While Blues Traveler may have headlined, Spin Doctors were probably the biggest band on the bill with the most commercial success at the time. The group’s 1991 debut, Pocket Full of Kryptonite, was well on its way to 5 times platinum sales status, thanks to the early 1992 hits “Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong” and “Two Princes.”Where Were Spin Doctors After the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?There was a quick over-saturation on Spin Doctors, but not at the point where H.O.R.D.E. launched. The band benefitted from the inescapable hit single “Two Princes” just as the tour began. But their reign as alt-rock darlings was short-lived as the follow-up 1994 album, Turn It Upside Down, barely made a dent commercially. And by the time their third album arrived in 1996, they had parted ways with founding guitarist Eric Schenkman.After their fourth album, 1999’s Here Comes the Bride, the band split with Mark White and the dismal returns continued. The group then had another significant setback when singer Chris Barron suffered acute vocal paralysis. By the spring of 2000, the singer had recovered and the original core lineup reunited.Two more albums would follow in the years to come, with Nice Talking to Me and If the River Was Whiskey, though it’s been since 2013 that they last released a new record.Looking back on the inaugural H.O.R.D.E. festival, singer Chris Barron told Relix, ""For all those bands it was a moment to look around and say, 'Hey, we’re not just standing on a cliff somewhere screaming out into any empty canyon. There are people out there who want to hear this kind of music. There are other bands that want to play this kind of music and we’re not just these Jerry Garcia, Jimi Hendrix, Duane Allman disciples banging our heads against the wall in the dark somewhere. This is actually something that has a place and an opportunity for us to take the music down the road a little further in our own way.'""Widespread Panicwidespread panicYouTube: Dose Trumploading...Where Were Widespread Panic Before the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?After their 1988 debut Space Wrangler, things started to pick up for Widespread Panic. They signed to Capricorn Records for their self-titled sophomore set and also found a fan in actor Billy Bob Thornton who directed their Widespread Panic: Live from the George Theatre concert video in 1991. With that buzz behind them, the group was one of the main draws for the inaugural H.O.R.D.E. festival.Where Were Widespread Panic After the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?1993’s Everyday became the band’s first charting album, cracking the Billboard 200 at No. 184. That was one of 10 more studio albums that followed after the band’s H.O.R.D.E. debut in 1992. In 2016, the band announced that they would break from touring so extensively and they’ve not released an album since. Longtime drummer and vocalist Todd Nance died in 2020 at the age of 57.Col. Bruce Hampton and Aquarium Rescue Unitcol. bruce hampton, aquarium rescue unitYouTube: Fred Adamsloading...Where Were Aquarium Rescue Unit Before the First H.O.R.D.E.Festival?Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit were one of many acts featuring acclaimed Atlanta musician Col. Bruce Hampton. The jazz fusion collective formed out of a weekly Atlanta jam session with Hampton joined by notable players Jimmy Herring, Oteil Burbridge, Jeff Sipe and Matt Slocum. The first of their two studio albums, 1992’s Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit, benefitted from having the H.O.R.D.E. platform to introduce them to a larger audience.Though not a huge name and still somewhat of an unknown at the beginning of the festival, the respect amongst those on the H.O.R.D.E. lineup for the collective was immense. John Popper recalled to Relix, ""They had the reverence of all the musicians. They did kind of embody the spirit of the H.O.R.D.E. movement, at least among us. They were an empire within an empire.""Where Were Aquarium Rescue Unit After the First H.O.R.D.E.Festival?The band went on to record Mirrors of Embarrassment in 1993, and collaborated with H.O.R.D.E. cohorts John Popper of Blues Traveler and Bela Fleck. But, by the end of 1993, Hampton would exit the lineup. The band, then going only by Aquarium Rescue Unit, recorded two more studio albums in 1994 before calling it quits.They did reunite in the 2000s, issuing 2003’s The Calling album and then pulled Hampton back into the fold for a live Warren Haynes Benefit Concert recording in 2007. Occasional reunions happened after, but Hampton died of a heart attack onstage in 2017 while appearing at a 70th birthday bash concert.Reflecting on the H.O.R.D.E. festival experience, Oteil Burbridge recalled to Relix, ""That whole time was so surreal because the ARU was the first time that we purposefully started a band with no hope, and therefore no intention of doing anything but scaring normal people away. We certainly never expected in our wildest dreams to get a record deal or be invited to be on a big tour. The people in those bands were so kind to us. They were our saviors. They flew our flag far and wide and took us under their wings. For them to believe in the absolute madness that we staked our entire lives on moves me in a way that I can’t really put into words.""READ MORE: 66 Best Rock Songs of the '90sPhishphishYouTube: Bennikenloading...Where Were Phish Before the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?After forming in 1983, Phish began to build their following and were two albums deep into their career with their third record A Picture of Nectar just arriving a few months prior to the launch of the H.O.R.D.E. festival. That record would be their first major label offering, having just signed with Elektra at the time.Where Were Phish After the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?Phish were part of the bill for the first leg of the H.O.R.D.E. festival, performing at the East Coast dates. This served as the group’s first national tour of major amphitheaters.Their star continued to rise over the course of the next year, landing several other major touring bills after H.O.R.D.E.As we now know, Phish have become one of the most successful touring acts of the last 30 years. Thirteen more studio albums followed their H.O.R.D.E. debut, and they’ve become one of the most beloved jam bands going.Reflecting on H.O.R.D.E., Phish's Mike Gordon recalled to Relix, ""I think that was our first arena gig, which was sort of a nice way to do it. With Phish we always cruised slowly. So even though we normally didn’t team up with other bands to do tours, getting our feet wet in an arena and seeing what it was like without having to carry the show by ourselves, that was a good opportunity for us.""Bela Fleckbela fleckYouTube: Randal Mortonloading...Where Was Bela Fleck Before the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?Bela Fleck had a well-established career by the time the inaugural H.O.R.D.E. festival invite came around. The musician, often accompanied by his band The Flecktones, recorded his first solo studio album in 1979. Prior to that, he was a member of the widely-hailed New Grass Revival. Between solo efforts and records with his band, he was nine albums into his career, with the most recent effort, UFO Tofu, being released with the Flecktones earlier in 1992. Fleck may have seemed an odd addition to the bill, but he managed to impress audiences and pull in new fans from the experience.Where Was Bela Fleck After the First H.O.R.D.E. Festival?Fleck continued to be one of bluegrass’ most respected musicians. He appeared on the second leg of southern U.S. dates on the inaugural H.O.R.D.E. festival, taking the spot vacated by Phish in the lineup.He’s had seven more solo albums, seven studio albums with The Flecktones and has played banjo on five studio albums between Abigail Washburn and the Sparrow Quartet. He’s won 15 Grammy Awards (with 33 nominations) and is a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.What Happened to the H.O.R.D.E. Festival After 1992?You can look at 1992 as a test run, with H.O.R.D.E. taking major strides forward in 1993 with a 28-date run taking things “everywhere” beyond the East Coast and Southern markets of the 1992 festival. Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic and Aquarium Rescue Unit returned in 1993 on a bill that included The Samples, Big Head Todd & the Monsters and Allgood, with Phish, the Allman Brothers Band, Melissa Etheridge, Warren Haynes, Dave Matthews and more turning up on select dates.The festival continued yearly through 1998 with such major acts as Sheryl Crow, the Dave Matthews Band, The Black Crowes, Cypress Hill, Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers, G. Love and Special Sauce, Taj Mahal, Lenny Kravitz, Rusted Root, Neil Young, King Crimson, Natalie Merchant, Beck, Ben Folds Five, Barenaked Ladies, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals and Alana Davis bringing a larger musical variety as the festival continued to evolve.After the 1998 festival, Blues Traveler decided to pull the plug on the event, feeling that it had grown stale with the audience. “H.O.R.D.E. initially was a way for Blues Traveler to play outside in the summer,” reflected Popper to Gig Magazine in 2000. “That was our objective and we pulled it off the first year. The second year we did it again; the third year we actually made, like, $8,000. The fourth year we started making real money, and then it became this source of income, and I see where you wanna keep it going again. But, y'know what? It's something you should never think has to go on forever. As soon as it doesn't make sense, it should be abandoned.”He continued, “What happened along the way was a lot of people got to interact with each other, some great music was made, a great vibe, and we all had a ball. That was completely accidental, and the best thing about it. I take no responsibility for it, and so I don't feel that stopping doing it ruins that — that great vibe will happen somewhere else.”10 Rock + Metal Tours From 1992 We Wish We Could See NowCapping off the 20th century with some remarkable concerts.";2023-08-04;https://loudwire.com/whatever-happened-acts-first-horde-festival/;2023-08-06;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIREWHATEVERHAPPENEDTOTHEACTSFROMTHEFIRSTH.O.R.D.E.FESTIVAL?
Loudwire;Ex-Foreigner Singer Claims 'Personal Vendetta' Has Kept Band From Being Nominated for Rock Hall;Would you vote them in?;"There are plenty of arguments to be made for bands that should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but there's one hit-making band from the '70s and '80s that surprisingly has still not even appeared on a ballot to be considered for induction - Foreigner. The band's singer through most of their commercial success was Lou Gramm, and during an appearance on The Rock Shop With Ralph (as seen below), Gramm claimed that a personal vendetta has kept the band's name being mentioned in the Rock Hall conversation.""It's not anything to do with our music or the amount of hits or notoriety or anything like that. It's a personal thing that we're not in there,"" stated the vocalist.Without calling the individual holding the grudge by name, Gramm did state, ""It's a personal vendetta between the gentleman who owns Rolling Stone and Mick [Jones]. It's very juvenile, the whole thing, and I don't think it's gonna get any better. I think it's gonna stay that way. I think we're being made an example of.""When asked if he felt the band should be in, Gramm remarked, ""Of course I do. The original Foreigner [lineup]. I put an exclamation point at the end of that [and it's not something] we need to talk about.""Foreigner's April Fool's Rock Hall PleaEarlier this year, Foreigner used the guise of April Fool's Day to make a plea for the Rock Hall via their socials. A message appeared on their site that read, ""In an unprecedented move, the entire board of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame met especially to nominate Foreigner. The board recognized that Mick Jones’ and Foreigner’s major contribution to music over the years warranted a very special place in the history of the Hall of Fame. Said manager Phil Carson, 'Needless to say, we are all delighted to learn of this unique privilege. I believe that the entire board realized that Foreigner had as many hits as Fleetwood Mac, just one less than the Eagles, and more than Journey and many other Hall Of Fame alumni. We are greatly looking forward to the induction ceremony.""A day later, Carson followed up on the posting saying that while it was meant with humor ""and not without a touch of irony,"" there is a very real case to be made for the band's induction.""Foreigner should be in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame,"" he wrote. ""Mick Jones' groundbreaking song writing and production skills coupled with music sales and performances that eclipse most of their contemporaries should be enough to warrant Foreigner’s nomination and induction. Mick founded Foreigner in 1977 and went on to conquer the world with as many Billboard top ten hits as Fleetwood Mac, just one less than the Eagles, and more than Journey and most of the heritage band Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame alumni. He created the current version of Foreigner in 2005 and chose the amazing Kelly Hansen as the lead singer to breathe new life into the songs he wrote and co-wrote.""""That band has performed around 100 shows all over the world each year since then and continues to play to sell out business as they continue the journey on their two year farewell tour,"" Carson added. ""Please try to see them before they are done, but most of all, help us put some pressure on the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame board to do the right thing while there is still time for them to deliver a stellar performance at their well deserved induction.""READ MORE: Foreigner's Kelly Hansen 'Open' to Working With Lou Gramm AgainBreaking Down Foreigner's Rock Hall CaseOver the course of their career, Foreigner have released nine studio albums, a majority of which were multi-platinum offerings.

Loudwire;Whoa, Lamb of God's Randy Blythe Cut Off His Dreadlocks;Come take a look!;"Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe has cut off his iconic dreadlocks and, at the band's show yesterday (July 12), he debuted a freshly shaved head, which surely came to the surprise of fans in attendance.Blythe hasn't directly posted anything about his new look yet, but Lamb of God sure did on their Instagram page.Over the years, the vocalist has sported a few different hairstyles, occasionally covering it up beneath a hat too. He's had shorter hair tussled on top and on the sides, your everyday long hair, a sideswept better-not-call-it-emo look and, during the Sacrament era, he was plain bald.Now, it's all been buzzed real tight, so he's not a total cueball, but it's pretty gosh darn close.So far, the summer has been a hot and humid one (we're pretty much living out the first two seconds of the smash Carlos Santana ft. Rob Thomas hit ""Smooth""), so Blythe probably feels a notable difference. Just make sure you slather some sunscreen on that dome, Randy!For fans, it's going to take a moment to get used to seeing the frontman execute his high jumps onstage without that mop of hair flying about with him, but we've all endured unexpected rocker haircuts before. We all survived Metallica's '90s haircuts, so this should be no biggie.Check out Blythe's new look below and view Lamb of God's setlist from the night further down the page.Lamb of God Setlist — July 12, 2023 (vis setlist.fm)01.

Loudwire;Steve Stevens Suggests Deadland Ritual Ended When 'Reality Hit';Why did the band stop after two songs?;"Though the members of the supergroup Deadland Ritual appear to look fondly upon their collaboration, it appears as though the short-lived supergroup has come to an end. While appearing on Eddie Trunk's Trunk Nation Sirius XM show, guitarist Steve Stevens reflected on the experience and why he feels that things didn't pan out in the long run.Stevens was asked about the band, which also featured Apocalyptica singer Franky Perez, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler and former Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver drummer Matt Sorum. He told Trunk (as transcribed by Blabbermouth), ""I think it's done, although there was a lot of material that was written that I hope will see the light of day in some form or another. I'm still friendly with all those guys.""As for why the band stopped after releasing only two songs, Stevens added that he felt a dose of reality hit the group as they started to promote their music. ""It was really difficult. We were about to sign a deal. We went out and toured Europe. We're all seasoned musicians and we're used to a certain lifestyle, and here we were having to open,"" said the guitarist.He continued, ""We did a number of festival dates and small club dates. Initially, everyone said they were willing to do that, willing to get in the trenches. When reality hit and there was crappy food and crappy hotels and all that kind of stuff, I think people lost interest.""That said, Stevens said musically things were definitely clicking. ""From the first day of rehearsal, to walk in there and play against the sound of Geezer Butler, man, I would have paid just to be there. Incredible. For bass players to have such a unique and profound influence on music, those records and that sound that I grew up with, and there I am playing against it, the hair stood up on my fucking arms,"" stated Stevens. ""I mean, it was incredible. And [he's] such a gentleman. And the rhythm section of him and Matt was undeniable.""Stevens isn't the only band member to suggest the supergroup's demise. In March of 2021, Geezer Butler also suggested that the group might not return after the pandemic as the members had moved on to other things. At the time, Butler added that he ""might rescue"" some of the material for a solo album.Over the course of their brief tenure, the band released the singles ""Down in Flames"" and ""Broken and Bruised.""Top 66 Rock + Metal Bassists of All-Time";2022-01-10;https://loudwire.com/steve-stevens-deadland-ritual-ended-reality-hit/;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRESTEVESTEVENSSUGGESTSDEADLANDRITUALENDEDWHEN'REALITYHIT'
Loudwire;Guitarist Rob Caggiano Issues Statement Concerning His Exit From Volbeat;See what he said.;"It was just last week that Volbeat delivered the news that they were parting ways with guitarist Rob Caggiano. The news came just ahead of a tour that kicked off last week, in which the band filled the void with The Arcane Order's Flemming C. Lund, who appears at present to be a temporary replacement. With a week to process the events, Caggiano has now offered up his own statement on his exit from the band.The group's initial statement was brief but positive, noting within it, ""We wish our brother Rob all the best with everything he does in the future (we know it’s going to be great)!"" Likewise, Caggiano doesn't delve too much into what happened, but does keep things on a positive note, thanking everyone for their support over the last week and wishing his now former bandmates ""best of luck moving forward.""Get Volbeat Tickets HereThe closest he comes to offering insight is when he states, ""I’m extremely proud of everything we accomplished together over the last 10 years. Sometimes relationships simply run their course. Sometimes certain obstacles, people or circumstances get in the way of the greater good. Sometimes people change and priorities shift. Sometimes it’s unavoidable. We had a very special undeniable magic together as a band. It’s not something that comes around too often in this life and it’s not something to be taken lightly. I certainly do not.""He also goes on to add, ""This is really a very emotional time for me I’m also extremely excited about what lies ahead in the future. Lots of exciting things happening right now. I really couldn’t be more fired up!!"" His full statement can be read below:Hello everyone.

It’s been very powerful and humbling for me to say the least. It’s reassurance that I’m on the right path and it means so much to me right now.To all the amazing fans and friends I’ve met all over the world throughout the years… I love and cherish each and every one of you. Thank you for sticking with me through hell or high water. The world seems to be getting weirder and weirder with each passing day and life never stops throwing twists and turns at us but you guys always keep me driven, focused and inspired to create music, follow my heart at all costs and chase my dreams wherever they may take me.

I’m extremely proud of everything we accomplished together over the last 10 years. Sometimes relationships simply run their course. Sometimes certain obstacles, people or circumstances get in the way of the greater good. Sometimes people change and priorities shift. Sometimes it’s unavoidable. We had a very special undeniable magic together as a band. It’s not something that comes around too often in this life and it’s not something to be taken lightly. I certainly do not.However, while this is really a very emotional time for me I’m also extremely excited about what lies ahead in the future. Lots of exciting things happening right now. I really couldn’t be more fired up!!

Loudwire;21 Years Ago - Death Founder Chuck Schuldiner Dies;On Dec. 13, 2001, the metal world suffered a great loss with the death of Death founder Chuck Schuldiner.;"One of the greatest tragedies in the history of death metal took place on Dec. 13, 2001, when Death frontman Chuck Schuldiner (pictured front center) died following a prolonged battle with a brain tumor. He was 34.Even though fans continue to debate whether or not Schuldiner coined the term death metal (extreme thrash band Possessed released a demo called Death Metal in 1984, the same year Death sent out their first demo Death by Metal), that issue was never important to Schuldiner. He never wanted to be the first, he just wanted to be known as a guy who pushed the boundaries of the genre. In an early interview, Schuldiner said he was flattered by people who considered him the founder of the genre, but added, “In my opinion Venom was the first to have that brutal vocal styles, tuned low, that initial brutal aggression. But maybe I’ve kept it going to what death metal is today.”There’s no question that Schuldiner played a major role in refining and developing the sound of the Florida death metal genre. He formed the band with guitarist Rick Rozz and drummer Kam Lee in 1983 at the age of 16, and released the band's first album, Scream Bloody Gore, on Combat Records in 1987. That album and the follow-up, 1988’s Leprosy, exemplified the sound of the underground genre and almost immediately, countless bands latched onto the band’s savage template, which combined churning down tuned guitars, hammering beats and growled vocals that were less decipherable than those of even their mentor's Venom.Throughout the band’s career, Schuldiner worked with a revolving door lineup of musicians to evolve the sound of the band, With 1990’s Spiritual Healing, Death started to transform into a progressive, technical death metal band, adding abrupt 90-degree rhythm shifts and multiple tempo changes without sacrificing their heavy groove. Schuldiner worked on the album with guitarist James Murphy, bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews. Just a year later, Schuldiner was working on the groundbreaking Human with jazz-death pioneers from the band Cynic, guitarist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert, adding even more twists and turns to Death’s sound and expanding the parameters of what death metal could be.“We supposedly wimped out back in 1990 with Spiritual Healing because there were so many traditional metal elements in the music,” Schuldiner told Guitar World. “I’m glad to see that a lot of these metal bands today are incorporating more traditional elements into their music because that’s where it all comes from. I never lost touch with that through the years, but I was very much crucified for it a while back. And I guess it’s good to know that I was doing the right thing.”By the time he was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor, pontine glioma, in 1999, Schuldiner had abandoned death metal and was playing progressive power metal in Control Denied, which formed in 1995, three years before Death’s progressive-death studio metal album The Sound of Perseverance. In 1999, Control Denied released their only album, The Fragile Art of Existence.Schuldiner underwent surgery for his tumor in 2000 and seemed to be on the mend at first. But a few months after the operation it was apparent that the part of the tumor that couldn’t be removed without killing the musician was rapidly growing and by 2001 the condition was inoperable.After Schuldiner died, over 1,000 artists that considered him an influence paid tribute to the musician and wrote messages in an online forum. ""Chuck's music was really important to me growing up,"" Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor told MTV. ""It was really intricate and interesting.""A decade after Schuldiner died the legacy of Death continued. A group of musicians who were in the band and other artists – guitarists Masvidal, Shannon Hamm, Bobby Koelble; bassists Steve Di Giorgio and Scott Clendenin; and drummers Masvidal, Gene Hoglan and Reinert – joined forces to pay tribute to Schuldiner on the ""Death to All"" charity tour. Vocalists and guitarists Charles Elliott (Abysmal Dawn) and Matt Harvey (Exhumed) were recruited for the dates. The group played five shows in 2012 and went out again in 2013, with Max Phelps handling vocals. The band has since changed its name to DTA and plan to book more shows in the future.“It’s a really cool tribute to our fallen metal brother, Chuck,” says Hoglan (Testament, Galaktikon, Dark Angel). “Obviously it’s a sad thing that Chuck has passed, but this way we get to keep the music alive and it’s really fun. You see grown men crying in the front row. Every night you see grounds of people tearing up. It’s really like a rebirth for the band in a way; Death played their final shows in 1998. A lot of the older guys that used to come are like, ‘I haven’t seen the band in 20 years and this is awesome!’ And there are also new people who were too young to catch Death when they were around but were influenced by the band and now get to see songs from the guys who originally played it. So it’s a great thing for everyone.”Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends, co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, as well as the co-author of Scott Ian’s autobiography, I’m the Man: The Story of That Guy From Anthrax, and Al Jourgensen’s autobiography, Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot!

Loudwire;Netflix Confirm 'Jackass 4.5' Release Date, Share Clip of New Swingset Stunt;That was fast!;"Netflix has confirmed May 20 as the release date for the feature film Jackass 4.5 and, accompanying the announcement, is a video trailer that teases a previously unseen stunt called ""Swingset Gauntlet.""The news comes just one month after the latest flick from Johnny Knoxville and the rest of his misfit crew of pranksters, Jackass Forever, arrived on a rival streaming platform, Paramount+, following a box office release that grossed more than $70 million worldwide.On Twitter, Netflix stated, ""Get ready for more stunts and stupidity with Jackass 4.5, an all-new feature film featuring the whole crew! Here's a small taste of what you can expect when it premieres May 20 on Netflix... This is the Swingset Gauntlet!""In the clip of the swingset stunt, seen below, participants don one-piece animal costumes and stand on wooden boxes that are sent gliding across a track in front of the swingset as others, swinging back and forth, attempt to land a firm kick and send their friends flying through the air.Things take a particularly violent turn when one participant, Nick Merlino, takes an exercise ball into the line of fire. A kick connects with it and launches Merlino skyward, but gravity makes quick work of him and brings him crashing back to the ground with an overwhelming thud and a roar of laughter from the others standing by.For Netflix, the impending arrival of Jackass 4.5 could serve as a small boon in the wake of a recent report of net subscriber loss, down 200,000 subscribers after the first quarter of 2022 despite a forecast of adding 2.5 million users, per Reuters. The company has forecasted it will lose another 2 million subscribers in the second quarter of this year and, as of Tuesday night (April 19), the streaming platform's stock price fell by 26 percent, which is a roughly $40 billion loss in market value.Netflix Share Jackass 4.5 Teaser Clip25 Awesome Celebrity Metalheads";2022-04-20;https://loudwire.com/jackass-4-5release-date-netflix/;2022-04-20;9999-12-31;1;LOUDWIRENETFLIXCONFIRM'JACKASS4.5'RELEASEDATE,SHARECLIPOFNEWSWINGSETSTUNT

We’ll then play the three tracks with the most votes during Loudwire Nights' Artist of the Week block to start the following Monday's show!This week our featured artist is one of the biggest alternative rock groups to come out of the '90s — and not from Seattle. Smashing Pumpkins were formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan, bassist D'arcy Wretzky, guitarist James Iha and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, though the lineup would change several times throughout the band's existence.Smashing Pumpkins were one of several groups to rise during the reign of Seattle grunge. Though they were actually from Chicago and didn't necessarily share many visual or sonic components with their grunge contemporaries, they certainly benefited from the media and radio's sudden emphasis on alternative rock. Their 1993 release Siamese Dream was their first commercially successful album, and its follow-up, 1995's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.Corgan and co. are still making albums and touring over three decades later. Their most recent record, 2020's Cyr, is a 20-track double album that runs over 70 minutes long. Though their tour plans were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we look forward to the day we get to see Smashing Pumpkins take the stage again.Head below to vote for your favorite Smashing Pumpkins song, and tune into Loudwire Nights next Monday at 7PM ET to find out which three tracks prevailed.Tune in tonight to hear which three songs by Nine Inch Nails you voted the best!Loudwire Nights with Toni Gonzalez airs nightly starting at 7PM ET.

Loudwire;Thom Yorke + Jonny Greenwood Reveal The Smile's Second Single 'The Smoke';The Radiohead offshoot go a bit more subtle this time.;"The Smile are going a bit more subtle with their second single, the understated bass-led ""The Smoke."" The band, consisting of Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood and Sons of Kemet's Tom Skinner, have definitely offered a change of pace after the high energy debut ""You Will Never Work in Television Again.""The new song follows a cool stroll along the bass line, with Yorke using some of his falsetto vocal to give the track a voice. If anything, it's a jazzier offering that is fleshed out with guest turns by tuba player Theon Cross and jazz trumpeter Byron Wallen, along with saxophonists Chelsea Carmichael and Jason Yarde, trombonist Nathaniel Cross and multi-instrumentalist Robert Stillman.The track comes with a new video shot with 16mm film by writer/director Mark Jenkin. You can check it out below.

Loudwire;Charlie Benante Shares Teaser Clip of New Anthrax Riffs;Feel the groove!;"If used, Anthrax could have one song on their new album that has an absolutely killer groove. Drummer Charlie Benante picked up a guitar and laid down some distortion fueled heaviness as a nod to some of the recent music they've been working on for their next studio album.""We have some good riffage for our new tunes,"" says a stamp over the video of Benante's guitar playing, with the musician then adding the caption, ""After a very successful tour with our friends in @blacklabelsocietyofficial and @hatebreedofficial we are Back to thinking about our new record… I think we have some heavy riffing on this one. See you at the @blueridgerockfest on Thursday.""The pandemic lockdown and Anthrax's 40th anniversary celebrations have allowed the band more time to flesh out their follow-up to 2016's For All Kings album. But the video of Benante jamming is a good sign that the group has returned their focus to completing their highly anticipated next album.In a 2021 interview with Full Metal Jackie, guitarist Scott Ian confirmed that writing for the new record started in 2019, but the band then stepped away from the music for a period during the lockdown. Anthrax resumed their new album work in 2021, but have also taken the time to tour as well.While there's a few weeks open after their Blue Ridge Rock Festival appearance tonight (Sept. 8), the band will be heading off to the U.K. for a tour leg with Municipal Waste for two weeks later this month carrying over to October.

Loudwire;The Pretty Reckless' Taylor Momsen - It Took Us a While to Be Accepted By Other Bands;She described their early years as 'an uphill battle.';"The Pretty Reckless have been around for over a decade, and are the only rock band fronted by a woman to have had seven No. 1 singles. Despite their success, vocalist Taylor Momsen admitted that it took them a while to be accepted by other rock bands, and described their early years as an ""uphill battle.""The Pretty Reckless released their debut album Light Me Up in 2010, but prior to that, Momsen was known for her roles in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Gossip Girl and more. Having always considered herself a musician first, she was determined to prove that she was serious about rock 'n' roll.Between their 2014 sophomore record Going to Hell and its 2016 follow-up Who You Selling For, the band scored four consecutive No. 1 singles, and then their most recent album Death By Rock and Roll garnered them another three.Momsen recalled to iHeartRadio Canada that there weren't as many rock bands led by women when TPR were starting out as there are today, and that it was a bit of a struggle for them to be accepted by their rock 'n' roll contemporaries as they chugged along.""I think that we've been around now for a while, and I think that we've certainly felt a shift in acceptance from other bands and from the industry and things like that, where I think in the beginning it was kind of an uphill battle — for me, at least — to kind of... people had a lot of preconceived notions about me, I guess,"" the singer said.""I think that it's taken time to kind of prove that this is a real thing and a real band, and not some sort of fling or whatever. So I think that that's been really amazing.""The vocalist confessed that she isn't a big fan of terms such as ""female-fronted rock band"" and the likes. While she thinks that it's important that women are represented in rock, she doesn't want the gender divide to be such a big focus within the industry, and she wants her band to be put up against every other band, not just the ones with female singers.""I wanna compete with the best of them, not just the other women.""Watch the interview below.The Pretty Reckless are heading out on tour with Shinedown and Diamante starting April 1.

Loudwire;'Hellraiser' Pinhead Actor Reveals His Metal Fandom, Calls Dani Filth a 'Trailblazer';Doug Bradley has also appeared on multiple Cradle of Filth albums.;"Given his look and aesthetic from the Hellraiser films, it should probably come as no surprise that actor Doug Bradley (aka Pinhead from the horror classic) has found some kindred spirits in the rock and metal world. In fact, in a new interview with Metal Hammer, the actor reveals his metal fandom and how great it has been to see the ties to his iconic role that was first originated in 1987.One of his longest running ties to metal has been through Cradle of Filth, repeatedly working with Dani Filth throughout the years lending narration to his band's music. Bradley first appeared on the Cradle of Filth album Midian and has returned multiple times over the years to lend narrations to tracks, including most recently on Cradle of Filth's Existence Is Futile album from 2021.“I mean, in [Dani Filth’s] case, he was something of a trailblazer with the kind of music that Cradle were doing, and I just love him as a guy,"" said Bradley. “He’s a great performer. Where the hell he produces those two voices from — that basso profundo growl and then that falsetto — without completely wrecking his vocal cords is a mystery to me. He’s a smart writer, and that shines out. And that’s really the reason I’ve kept going back to work with him.""Bradley revealed that he's also chatted with big time horror movie fan Corey Taylor of Slipknot in the past. In fact, he said he's often been asked about Slipknot over the years, especially after they first appeared with Craig Jones sporting a Pinhead-like mask.""Quite a lot of metal costuming seems to nod fairly heavily towards Hellraiser. The leather, the disfiguration, the metal! The female Cenobite has that metal construction around the neck. Pinhead’s flesh is literally hooked to his costume. So, all the elements are there, I suppose.""Another iconic rock and metal shout out stands out to Bradley as well, with Alice Cooper once being photographed wearing a Pinhead T-shirt. ""That’s one of the proudest moments of my life,"" says Bradley. ""I think it was a Sunday Times interview. You know, the big interview — the two-page interview that they used to do, with Alice Cooper. And I thought, 'Well, that's cool.

The reception from audiences over the Summer has already been great and we are looking forward to the forthcoming dates in the UK and Europe across the rest of the year. “It is clear that Simon also holds great respect for those before him. We are all excited for what the years to come hold for the band.” ""Simon McBride comments: “Im very happy to be asked to join the band at the start of the pandemic if someone would have said to me that I was going to be the new guitarist in Deep Purple I would have just laughed but here we are and its happening.""

As part of their ongoing Re-Imperatour North American tour Ghost played a show at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in Maryland Heights Missouri on Friday night 11th August. Two days before the show Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre issued an entry requirement to fans on their social media accounts reading: “Face paint or masks covering the face are not allowed while entering the venue or purchasing items at concessions. Any face coverings must be removable upon request.” Many fans voiced their bafflement with the statement with one writing on Facebook: “I’m confused I emailed you guys about the paint and was told it was fine. But then this post says while entering. Does this mean NO altogether or not until after check in? I’m fine not having it but this is confusing and I don’t want to be turned away.” The venue replied: “We do not allow face paint while entering the venue or if you are making purchases at concessions. Masks are fine as they can be removed for entrance concessions.” Clarifying Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre added in another comment: “Anything that distorts your face to the point that you do not resemble your photo id is not allowed.” Many fans who seemingly hadn’t seen the strict face paint policy turned up in full Ghost regalia and were ordered to remove the make-up by staff. “It really sucked that a lot of us begged you to elaborate on your public Facebook and you refused to give answers. Your staff humiliated a LOT of fans at the gate” one fan wrote. Another tweeted: “Was severely disappointed in how this was handled a post two days before the show and then people with and without masks and face paint inside the venue? Like what ? People being turned away some lady in a pink cowboy hat making a lot of confusion orders to us in line.” Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre has since issued a statement for the “miscommunication” and clarifying that Ghost had nothing to do with their masks and face paint policy. “Thanks to everyone who joined us for an amazing Ghost show last night. On behalf of our crew we’d like to apologize for a miscommunication about removing face paint” Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre wrote. “This was not directed by Ghost. If you experienced issues at last night’s show please reach out to us at Hollywoodampstl@livenation.com so we can improve for future shows.” Ghost themselves have now shared the venue’s statement and they wrote: “We wish to inform you that we will ALWAYS encourage creative expression we will NEVER stifle it."" In the comments a Ghost fan wrote: “Land of the free yeah right. 🤦u200d♀️ In no other country have I heard of such bs venue policy.” ""Another said: “Imagine going to a Kiss concert and being told not to wear makeup?

Watch the video for lead single 'The Western Sky' now. ;"Fresh from premiering their lead single ‘The Western Sky’ on Breakfast with Paul Anthony this morning Thunder have announced details of their first ever double album ‘Dopamine.’ Released on Friday 29th April 2022 ‘Dopamine’ contains 16 all-new Thunder tracks split equally between two discs. The album was recorded at Rockfield & Vada studios and mixed by Mike Fraser. ""Commenting on band’s 14th studio record Thunder guitarist and producer Luke Morley said: “We didn’t set out to make a double album but as the writing and recording process went on we wandered into some interesting areas and then it became a case of can we afford to leave any of this off?’ In the end we did reduce it from 20 tunes to 16 but it wasn’t an easy choice.” "" The ‘Dopamine’ album title nods towards the world’s increased use of social media during the coronavirus pandemic and the endless quest for the next hit of happy hormones. The album cover duly reflects this themes: Elucidating further Luke Morley said: “I read a fascinating article by an American psychologist who said that social media forces us to become dopamine addicts. We’re validated and liked on social media which releases the dopamine – and so we get addicted to it. “We take more and more selfies in the hope of more and more validation and the album cover reflects this. People are surrounded by amazing things that they’re missing because they’re so self-obsessed. Of course you’ll have to get your hands on the physical album to see all of the amazing things I’m referring to.” As heard first on Planet Rock lead single ‘The Western Sky’ is a driving riff-heavy celebration of Thunder’s annual trans-American charity motorbike trip. The song comes with a spectacular animated video which you can check out below! ‘Dopamine’ will be available in CD and double LP vinyl formats with exclusive lenticular cover versions available only from the Thunder online store. The album comes hot on the heels of March 2021’s ‘All The Right Noises’ which stormed in at Number 3 on the Official Album Chart and became Thunder’s sixth Top 10 album of their illustrious career.

Planet Rock;Chad Kroeger explains why he's thankful for Nickelback haters ;Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger has thanked the keyboard warriors who have spouted hatred about the band over the years.;"Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger has thanked the keyboard warriors who have spouted hatred about the band over the years. Despite Nickelback being a highly successful multi-million-selling arena band the Canadian rock juggernauts are often a target for bile online. In a new interview with the KLOS radio show frontman Chad Kroeger said the band’s enduring success is partially down to their haters. ""“All the detractors all the haters all the keyboard heroes they have no idea how much they keep us in the press loop. Its hilarious” Kroeger said. "" “Those people that would love to see us go away if they really wanted to see us go away they would just shut up. Because all those bands that came out with us at the same time are all gone because nobody said anything about them. They all just sort of disappeared. ""“But weve really kind of spun this whole negative thing into a positive thing. And here we are!” "" Commenting on the memes about Nickelback on the internet Kroeger continued: ""If its music oriented and we think its funny we just leave it there because the band collectively has a great sense of humour. I mean funnys funny. Just rude and ignorant thats different. And yeah obviously theres tons of that too. But funny is funny and as the Brits would say we have no problem taking the piss out of ourselves."" In 2019 Nickelback bassist Mike Kroeger revealed that some haters have plunged to the depths of “verbally attacking our families and sending us death threats.” ""Asked how he feels about the hate aimed at Nickelback Mike Kroeger said: “Initially it kind of hurt our feelings. I think its safe to say anyone in the world would feel that way if people were saying negative things about you. "" ""“I think as time has gone on it sort of became humorous sometimes. Sometimes people try so hard to be mean that it falls flat and I think thats the case most of the time.” "" ""He continued: “It doesnt matter if its my band or not if someone says something that is legitimately funny Ill laugh at it especially if its me. Sometimes people can just be outright nasty and take things too far and start verbally attacking our families and sending us death threats and all that kind of stuff and thats where you have to step back and think ‘Were obviously doing something right if someone hates us that much’ and you let it go because you have better things to do. "" ""“I dont really see a benefit to reacting to these people and being nasty back at them.” "" Nickelback released their 10th studio album ‘Get Rollin’ last November and it dented the Top 10 in the UK.

Alongside featuring the video debut of their co-lead guitarist Phil Collen Def Leppard’s ‘Photograph’ video in January 1983 also saw Joe Elliott unveil his fetching new attire of Union Jack shirt skin-tight plastic trousers and red leg warmers. Just over 40 years on Joe has now insisted that the iconic look wasn’t part of some grand plan. ""The day before the Photograph video I had a budget of £25 to buy something to make this video the next day"" Joe explains. ""I was down at Kings Road in London and I think it may have been McLarens shop Sex. I bought these plastic trousers that were too short so I had to get leg warmers. Adidas boots handcuff belt. Ive got 8 quid left and theres this Union Jack shirt for £7.99. Outfit done. It wasnt some big plan. It was just all I had."" Joe previously told Sirius XM: ""It was an accident. Rick Allen was wearing the Jack shorts in 81 and nobody took any notice. But then you see him jumping off the riser in the Photograph video and we began to see these in the crowd and then somebody maybe a manager said we should sell them. “So we just started picking them up for the merch stand and we just thought it was hilarious all these Americans buying these Union Jack shirts.

"" The Wolfsbane frontman esteemed solo artist and former Iron Maiden vocalist suffered a heart attack on Saturday night 25th March and understandably all his upcoming tour dates were postponed. Mark Appleton and Christopher Appleton who is also the Absolva frontman have released a statement today confirming that Blaze is in “excellent spirits” in hospital and he hasn’t lost his “strength and sense of humour.” They added that Blaze needs triple or possibly quadruple heart bypass surgery and his recovery period will be “many months.” With touring not on the horizon for a good while they have urged fans to buy merch from Blaze Bayley’s official store to support them financially during this difficult period. The full statement reads: “We visited Blaze in hospital yesterday & first of all we’re delighted to say we found him in excellent spirits sitting up in bed. We of course had an update on his condition but also a really good chat & a laugh as normal. Blaze has certainly not lost his strength & sense of humour! “Moving on from that he does require surgery & within the next few days as soon as hospital capacity allows he will be undergoing a triple possibly quadruple heart bypass. This is obviously not a small matter & we should expect that his recovery period will be many months. We will announce the impact on the tour diary once we’ve discussed with the relevant venues & promoters. “Nevertheless Blaze is looking ahead with optimism for a full recovery with good health & fitness & the full benefit of the surgery & treatment. “On behalf of Blaze & all of us in the team we thank you so much for all the messages of love & support. It really has been incredible & Blaze is both energised & emotional in response. “As most of you will understand Blaze is a completely independent artist & so the postponement of the current tour & future dates is a particularly big blow. For those of you that would like to help us get through this period we ask you to please buy merch from our webshop probably items that you would have bought at one of the shows. Your support in that way would be very much appreciated by Blaze & ourselves as the management team www.blazebayleyshop.com “In the meantime we have Blaze’s blessing to work on Absolva recordings & tour schedule as of course they are also hugely impacted by the current situation. “We will keep you updated with developments as & when they happen.” Blaze Bayley – real name Bayley Alexander Cooke – founded Wolfsbane in Tamworth in 1984 and was a member of the band for a decade until he replaced Bruce Dickinson in Iron Maiden. He performed on two Iron Maiden albums 1995’s ‘The X Factor’ and ‘Virtual XI’ before Bruce Dickinson returned to the band shortly before the millennium. Blaze went on to form the eponymous band Blaze before Wolfsbane reunited. He still tours with Wolfsbane and as a solo act and he rocked the Main Stage at Planet Rockstock last December. _Everyone at Planet Rock wishes Blaze a full and speedy recovery._ ";2023-03-29;https://planetradio.co.uk/planet-rock/news/rock-news/blaze-bayley-health-update/;2023-03-29;9999-12-31;1;PLANETROCKBLAZEBAYLEY'SMANAGEMENTSHARESTATEMENTUPDATINGFANSONHISHEALTH
Planet Rock;Dolly Parton makes Rock and Roll Hall of Fame U-turn;Dolly Parton has dropped her plan to withdraw from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame shortlist. ;Country icon Dolly Parton has dropped her plan to withdraw from the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame shortlist. After being named among the 17 eclectic acts on the shortlist for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s class of 2022 Dolly Parton issued an official statement on 14th March saying she does not “feel that I have earned the right” to be included on the Rock Hall’s list. She also explained that she did not “want votes to be split because of me” so she must “respectfully bow out.” A few days later the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame issued a highly complementary statement praising Parton but insisting that she’s still on the ballot. Now in a fresh interview with NPR’s Morning Edition Parton says she’s had a change of heart after learning that the Rock Hall is more musically eclectic than its name suggests. Asked what she’ll do if she’s inducted Parton said: “I’ll accept gracefully and I’ll accept it because the fans vote.” “It was always my belief that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame was for people in rock music” Parton continued. “I have found out lately that it’s not necessarily that. “But if they can’t go there to be recognised where do they go? So I just felt like I was taking away from someone that maybe deserved it certainly more than me because I never considered myself a rock artist. But obviously there’s more to it than that.” Over the weekend the top five artists in the Rock Hall’s fan vote were revealed with Duran Duran coming out on top ahead of Eminem Pat Benatar Eurythmics and Dolly Parton. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 2022 inductees will be revealed later this month and the ceremony will take place in the autumn. ;2022-05-03;https://planetradio.co.uk/planet-rock/news/rock-news/dolly-parton-rock-hall-u-turn/;2022-05-05;9999-12-31;1;PLANETROCKDOLLYPARTONMAKESROCKANDROLLHALLOFFAMEU-TURN

Planet Rock;Pete Waterman: Shelved Judas Priest collaboration would have been Stock Aitken Waterman's 'biggest' hit;Pete Waterman says that Stock Aitken Waterman’s surprise collaboration with Judas Priest would have been the production trio’s ‘biggest-ever hit’ had it been released. ;"Pete Waterman says that Stock Aitken Waterman’s surprise collaboration with Judas Priest in the late 1980s would have been the production trio’s ‘biggest-ever record’ had it seen the light of day. In 1988 at a time when SAW were dominating UK charts with hits from the likes of Rick Astley Kylie Minogue Jason Donovan and Mel & Kim metal legends Judas Priest joined forces with Stock Aitken Waterman in the recording studio in France. Judas Priest recorded a cover of The Stylistics’ ‘You Are Everything’ together with the original Stock Aitken Waterman tracks ‘I Will Return’ and ‘Runaround’. ""Despite getting on famously in the studio Judas Priest decided to shelve the recordings and they have never officially been released. An alleged sample of You Are Everything has been shared on YouTube however it’s unclear whether it’s the legitimate recording:"" Commenting on the collaboration in a new interview with NME Pete Waterman says the version of ‘You Are Everything’ “would have been our biggest-ever record.” Waterman explained: “We had great respect for each other. Matt Aitken ended up playing more rock guitar than they did! We went for it. We were more rock ‘n’ roll than Judas Priest! They kept saying: ‘No we want more SAW’ while we’re going ‘F--- SAW we want to do more rock ‘n’ roll!” He added: “When we played the song they said: ‘It’s a Number One record – which is the last thing we want!’ “They missed a trick because now you have the Foo Fighters covering Rick Astley and anything goes but their manager was frightened that it was going to end up as the biggest song of their career and 16-year-old girls would start turning up to their stadium gigs.” Writing in his latest book Biblical Rob Halford hailed the Stock Aitken Waterman songs as “brilliant” and “a great meeting of pop and metal” but Priest ultimately didn’t want them to be released. Halford wrote: “It could have been the kiss of death for our career if our most hardcore metal fans had been so disgusted by us making ‘pop crap’ that they just stopped coming to see us. I guess we chickened out.” He added: “I like to think that if we were ever to release those songs now nearly thirty-five years on even our most hardcore metal fans might say ‘You know what? Those SAW songs are absolute belters!’” ""Judas Priest are scheduled to tour the UK this May and June on Ozzy Osbournes No More Tours 2 tour.""

The rock legends are slated to play Power Trip in California this October. ;"ACDC appear to be teasing their first live concert in more than seven years. The rock legends took to their social media channels last night 28th March to share a 23-second teaser video for an American music festival called Power Trip. It’s expected that the rock extravaganza will take place at the Empire Polo Club in Indio California on the weekend of Friday 6th to Sunday 8th October 2023 and will ""feature legendary rock heavy performers from the 1970s and 1980s” according to The Scenester. ACDC’s video features collaged images of rock equipment and desert imagery and slowly reveals the Power Trip logo. The short clip ends with the iconic riffs from ACDC’s seminal 1980 anthem ‘Back in Black.’ The band captioned the clip ‘Are you ready for a Power Trip?’ Yesterday Metallica Iron Maiden Ozzy Osbourne and Tool all shared Power Trip videos strongly suggesting they’re all playing the event too. An official announcement will be made tomorrow Thursday 30th March. If Power Trip does indeed herald ACDC’s very welcome return it will be the band’s first concert since they played the Wells Fargo Center way back in 2016 when Axl Rose was singing with the band They haven’t performed with Brian Johnson on vocals since February 2016 shortly before he was ordered to retire by doctors or risk losing his hearing. Johnson has since joined forces with audio expert Stephen Ambrose who has invented a new type of in-ear monitor allowing him to perform live.

Planet Rock;Aerosmith's Steven Tyler withdraws from February event due to ongoing health concerns;Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler has withdrawn from performing at the Power of Love Gala in Las Vegas in February due to health concerns. ;"Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler has withdrawn from performing at the Power of Love Gala in Las Vegas next month due to health concerns. The 74-year-old vocalist was due to appear and be honoured at the event at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Saturday 18th February however Tyler’s manager Larry Rudolph has confirmed he has pulled out. ""Stevens doctors have instructed him to take care of himself but he will be back this year"" Rudolph said in a short statement to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Proceeds from the Power of Love Gala are going to the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and Tyler was due to be honoured for his distinguished music career and his ongoing charity work. Taking its name from the Aerosmith song ‘Janie’s Got a Gun’ Tyler founded the Janie’s Fund charity in 2015 in partnership with Youth Villages to bring hope and healing to girls who have suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect. In December Aerosmith axed the final two dates of their Deuces Are Wild residency in Las Vegas due to Steven Tyler’s ongoing ill health. Tyler said at the time: “On the advice of my doctor I’m taking more time to rest… there is nowhere we’d rather be than on stage surrounded by the greatest fans in the world.” Last May Aerosmith cancelled part of their Las Vegas residency to enable Steven Tyler to complete a drug treatment programme in rehab. Three months earlier Aerosmith’s European fans were left devastated when the band cancelled their entire summer trek including their English arena shows in London Manchester and Leeds. The band also had mainland European dates planned for Russia Portugal Spain Switzerland France Denmark Czech Republic Austria Hungary and Poland. When Aerosmith first announced their rescheduled summer 2022 tour the band listed Glastonbury on the Tour Dates section of their official website before it was swiftly deleted. The headline slot of course never happened.

Planet Rock;Roger Waters has re-recorded Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side of the Moon' by himself;Roger Waters has revealed that he has finished re-recorded Pink Floyd’s seminal eighth studio album ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ without the knowledge of his former band mates.;"Roger Waters has revealed that he has finished re-recording Pink Floyd seminal eighth studio album ‘The Dark Side of the Moon without the knowledge of his former band mates. The 1973 masterpiece celebrates its 50th anniversary next month and to mark the landmark occasion Pink Floyd are reissuing ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ as a deluxe box set and they’re also releasing an official book. In a new interview with The Telegraph Roger Waters says he has re-recorded the whole of ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ from scratch and he didn’t seek permission from his former band mates David Gilmour and Nick Mason “I wrote The Dark Side of the Moon” Waters stated. “Let’s get rid of all this ‘we’ crap. Of course we were a band – there were four of us we all contributed – but it’s my project and I wrote it so blah.” Roger Waters was credited as the lyricist for all 10 tracks on the album however he only has sole credit for the music on three songs – ‘Money’ ‘Brain Damage’ and ‘Eclipse.’ Confirming that he’s eyeing up a May 2023 release date Waters admitted there may be some legal issues around the re-recording. “I’m no copyright expert but might there be some obstacles to that? I have no idea” he said. Asked why he’s re-recorded such a momentous album Waters explained: ""Because not enough people recognised what it’s about what it was I was saying then.” Waters also criticised his former Pink Floyd band mates including the late-great Rick Wright who he spoke about in the present tense saying none of them were good lyricists. “Well Nick never pretended” Waters said. “But Gilmour and Rick? They can’t write songs they’ve nothing to say. They are not artists. They have no ideas – not a single one between them. They never have had and that drives them crazy."" In a separate interview with the Berliner Zeitung Waters said of his new Dark Side recording: “The new concept is meant to reflect on the meaning of the work to bring out the heart and soul of the album musically and spiritually. ""I’m the only one singing my songs on these new recordings and there are no rock and roll guitar solos.” ""In December Roger Waters released ‘The Lockdown Sessions’ EP which featured his versions of five Pink Floyd tracks including ‘Comfortably Numb’ from The Wall."" The news of a new version of ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ comes a few days after the rift between Roger Waters and David Gilmour intensified following a tweet from Gilmour’s wife Polly Samson. In response to an interview Waters had conducted Samson tweeted on Monday morning: “Sadly @rogerwaters you are antisemitic to your rotten core. Also a Putin apologist and a lying thieving hypocritical tax-avoiding lip-synching misogynistic sick-with-envy megalomaniac. Enough of your nonsense.” In response a statement on Roger Waters’ social media channels read: “Roger Waters is aware of the incendiary and wildly inaccurate comments made about him on Twitter by Polly Samson which he refutes entirely. He is currently taking advice as to his position.” David Gilmour concurred with his wife’s opinion of Waters saying every word in the tweet was “demonstrably true.” Roger Waters’ ‘first farewell tour’ visits the UK this summer for arena dates in Birmingham Glasgow London and Manchester. We very much doubt David Gilmour will be on the guest list.

Planet Rock;Stonedead Festival 2023 review and photos ft. Blue Öyster Cult, Black Star Riders, Therapy? & more;Planet Rock reviews all the action from Stonedead Festival 2023, featuring Blue Öyster Cult, Black Star Riders, Therapy?, The Answer, King King and more;"Nostalgia can be a fine thing by itself but when happy memories get elevated beyond mere pub banter and knowing smiles truly great things can be forged from its fires. That’s certainly been the case with Stonedead a staple here at Newark Showground since 2018. Twelve fans of Castle Donington’s old Monsters of Rock festival who lamented the demise of that event’s single-day single-stage format wanted to revive at least the basics of that storied spectacle thankfully without the moronic bottle-throwing ‘battles’. Now in its fifth year Stonedead has established itself as a celebration of both the new and the classic in rock – and just like last year it’s completely sold out. Mission accomplished then. The organisers have gone the extra mile to provide a varied and somewhat surprising bill again reflecting the values that underpinned Monsters of Rock. There’s a rare appearance from US rock veterans Blue Öyster Cult as headliners along with a UK debut for Canadian outfit Deraps Collateral’s competition-winning opening slot and – the meat in the sandwich – crowd-pleasing performances from established festival favourites like Black Star Riders and The Answer. There’s also no shortage of community spirit. This year both vendors and audience have been donating surplus food stock to Newark Foodbank. Stonedead’s done this previously but with the foodbank now more actively involved there are multiple drop-off points throughout the site. “The way the audience has run with it is amazing” said co-director Louise Bayley. In addition a fundraising bike ride for men’s mental health charity Andys Man Club completed its quest on the Friday reaching the showground where they were greeted by Planet Rock’s Paul Anthony. The hardy group of like-minded rock fans braved the not entirely agreeable weather to raise over £2000 for this great cause. Hopefully they arrived in time to witness the opening night’s three-band bill – excellent performances from **The Karma Effect** **Kira Mac** and **Myke Gray’s Skin** – all well attended despite seriously lashing rain. There’s an ominous black cloud over the stage when **Collateral** open festivities on Saturday morning but thankfully it’s not a sign of things to come. Kicking off with ‘Mr Big Shot’ the band’s breezy carefree sounds quickly banish any suggestion of bad karma and their infectious enthusiasm dispels weather-based cynicism. The Kent-based outfit have user friendly 80s-inspired tunes like ‘Lullaby’ and ‘Merry Go Round’ in their happy repertoire. While they’re unlikely to start fires they sure as hell won’t be dampening any and it’s worth remembering they won a public vote to land this slot – and make the most of it they do. Similarly Bournemouth’s **South Of Salem** are a band on the rise. They’re heavier live than on record – that sound in raw unpolished form holds greater promise than has been hinted so far. There’s often been a sense that the outfit is holding back not truly unleashing the firepower they’ve got in the locker. On stage there are stronger hints sounds that almost match their deliciously vampish goth-punk look. ‘No Plague Like Home’ impresses today as does new song ‘Static’ – pieces of a puzzle that with more aural violence could make for a visceral final assembly. **Deraps** making their UK debut open with what appears to be a cover of Van Halen’s ‘Hot For Teacher’. But wait – it’s not; it just sounds almost identical. Throughout this largely affable trio surge through endlessly flashy guitar work courtesy of gold-trousered mainman Jacob Deraps and while the songs do stand up on their own – especially blues rocker ‘Live Fast Die Slow’ – you can’t pretend they’re not derivative. Three flypasts from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight’s Avro Lancaster one of only two of the Second World War bombers still flying offers a mighty distraction from this somewhat predictable fare. Bizarrely Deraps do drop in the real ‘Hot For Teacher’ before departing. Last minute replacements for Mason Hill Welshmen **Florence Black** give us a welcome taste of focus and poise – with frontman Tristan Thomas taking time to send his and our best wishes to Mason Hill singer Scott Taylor a very well-liked chap who was sadly taken ill recently. Florence Black play with practised confidence dishing out heaviness like oldie ‘Smoke’ along with equally enticing new track ‘Don’t Hold Me Down’. Although their sound isn’t as ferocious as it’s been known to be the sheer will and fibre underpinning everything from opener ‘Zulu’ to the infectious ‘Black Cat’ makes this set yet another winner for the Merthyr Tydfil powerhouse. Long established blues groovers **King King** deal a different set of cards. There’s an immersive clarity to their sound as you’d expect from a seasoned outfit that specialises in turbulent blues and guitar-borne soul. ‘Long Time Running’ manifests beautifully from Alan Nimmo’s heartfelt vocals and blossoming emotive guitar solos – and nobody is enjoying it more than a man at the front clad in a perpetually nodding giraffe outfit. It’s an amusingly ludicrous counterpoint to the likes of ‘Waking Up’ and ‘I Will Not Fall’ which reaches a rousing finale via Alan’s brother and fellow six-stringer Steve. “It’s phase one of the great Irish takeover” cackles **The Answer’s** Cormac Neeson referring to themselves and subsequent performances from fellow emerald islanders Therapy? and Black Star Riders’ Ricky Warwick. With the lunchtime rain clouds dispersed sun now beats upon the gathered believers who are treated to a spectacular near tribal display of pulsing blues-powered rock at its best. If The Answer pulled victory from defeat in Steelhouse Festival’s mud and rain last month then they are sensational today in the sudden golden light of summer. ‘Blood Brother’ rallies the clans ‘Come Follow Me’ immerses them and ‘Preachin’’ remains a crazy gospel-tinged slide guitar ride climactic in every sense. ""If you want a sense of distance travelled festival host Krusher points out that he first introduced **Therapy?** onto a stage exactly 28 years ago to this day. Fittingly that was over at Donington’s 1995 Monsters Of Rock the event that inspired the thing we’re enjoying today. That event had officially been dubbed Escape from the Studio due to Metallicas decision to headline while recording ‘Load’ but it was the penultimate Monsters event at Donington in every other sense."" The most joyful thing about this skip in time and generation is that Therapy? have lost absolutely nothing. Andy Cairns still makes one guitar sound like three. Bassist Michael McKeegan still cannot stop smiling even as Andy is shouting lyrics like “All people are shit!” ‘Knives’. Dammit the two of them even still look pretty much the same. As ever Andy is both a genial and thoughtful host – reflecting the focus of the festival bike ride’s fundraising he introduces a superb ‘Kakistocracy’ with the words “when our friends are in trouble we listen to them and then we talk to them.” ‘Teethgrinder’ then sees a succession of bodies disappearing over the barrier as they did in the band’s heyday and ‘Screamager’ simply seals the deal on another memorable cathartic performance. There’s a rather lovely moment straight after too when Krusher surprises the hell out of Planet Rock’s tireless marketing manager Jon Norman by presenting him with the festival’s Services To Rock Award. The golden-horned accolade is richly deserved by Jon the man who makes everything happen at Planet Rock without seeking to take even a jot of credit. Today finally we get to say thank you. There’s a celebratory feel about **Black Star Riders** too. Now performing as a fiercely driven muscular-sounding four-piece there’s little time to chat as they simply reel off live favourite after live favourite – ‘When The Night Comes In’ ‘Another State Of Grace’ ‘Better Than Saturday Night’ et al. The remarkable Sam Wood who has stepped in for Saxon’s Paul Quinn and Ginger Wildheart the past month alone now performs most of Scott Gorham’s guitar parts the Thin Lizzy legend having decided to step back from Black Star Riders duties. ‘Jailbreak’ dedicated to Scott is as thrilling as ever. There’s also a ‘you-had-to-be-there’ moment not long after when Therapy?’s Andy Cairns joins Ricky Warwick on both vocals and guitar for a celebratory ‘Finest Hour’. “Rock n’ roll is about unity and we will never forget that” Ricky rumbles afterwards. They bow out with a brilliant ‘Bound For Glory’ and quite frankly Black Star Riders could have been headlining. That honour instead falls to the near mythical **Blue Öyster Cult** they of cosmic-proportioned occasionally space-themed 70s rock classics. They’re led by Eric Bloom now 78 and Buck Dharma 75 and to describe this veteran outfit as an unusual placement on the UK festival circuit would be understating the circumstances quite dramatically. In fact it’s hard to judge what’s more interesting the band’s performance or the reaction of Stonedead’s audience to it. Aside from the obvious classics - ‘Godzilla’ ‘Burnin’ For You’ and the seminal ‘Don’t Fear The Reaper’ - BOC’s output is so esoteric that in another lifetime it might easily have been lost to history. While the crowd barely reacts to ‘Before The Kiss A Redcap’ from the band’s 1972 debut or the more prog-inclined ‘Golden Age Of Leather’ they do watch on unified. Part of it you feel is respect for the artists on stage while another part of it is a strange form of late evening hypnotism brought on by these unorthodox psychedelic-tinted meanderings. It’s the oddest of things at a rock show – silent fascination. The rowdier ‘That Was Me’ from the band’s most recent album 2020’s ‘The Symbol Remains’ shows the act’s modern incarnation can do concise and direct when it wants to and while the aliens-from-the-future prog rock of ‘The Vigil’ from 1979’s ‘Mirrors’ leaves this crowd just standing and staring it’s never less than impressive to watch the seasoned intricacy of Dharma’s guitar work on the video screens. Bloom transitions easily from vocals to guitar and to keyboards as does bandmate Richie Castellano. Aside from their undeniably great hits the band are a deep dive into non-linear arrangements and themes that address everything from drug deals gone wrong to extraterrestrial life. Whether there is or isn’t enough cowbell is a discussion we can leave but undeniably Blue Öyster Cult are a magnificently strange and strangely magnificent conclusion to as Bloom puts it “a great day of rock n’ roll”.

Planet Rock;Iron Maiden's replica Spitfire malfunctions at US concert – watch;Iron Maiden’s inflatable replica Spitfire suffered an unfortunate malfunction at the band’s concert in Worcester, Massachusetts on Monday 17th October.;"Iron Maiden inflatable replica Spitfire suffered an unfortunate malfunction at the band’s concert in Worcester Massachusetts last night Monday 17th October. The heavy metal legends were performing set closer ‘Aces High at the DCU Center and as usual their visually striking Spitfire plane was hovering above their heads. However rather than swooping over the stage the Spitfire appeared to get stuck. It was lowered and a number of Iron Maiden’s crew seemingly tried to resolve the situation. Sadly just a minute and a half into the performance the Spitfire was deflated and pulled from the stage. The faithfully recreated Spitfire plane is a 90% sized replica of an actual Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vb registration number AA 853 from 302 Squadron that saw active duty in during World War II in 1941. Iron Maiden singer pilot and aviation aficionado Bruce Dickinson said of the replica in 2018: “We would have made it actual size but we had to cut it down by 10% to fit on some of the festival stages otherwise it’s an exact replica of arguably the greatest plane design ever in fact one of the best designed machines ever!” Iron Maiden have just five concerts to go on their Legacy of the Beast World Tour and they conclude the 139-date trek at Tampa’s Amalie Arena on Thursday 27th October. Next year Iron Maiden return with a brand new tour The Future Past Tour which will see them perform material from 2021’s ‘Senjutsu 1986’s ‘Somewhere in Time’ and classic tracks.

Planet Rock;Watch Shane Hawkins perform two songs with Foo Fighters at LA Taylor Hawkins Tribute;Shane Hawkins took to the stage once again in Los Angeles on Tuesday night 27th September at the second show honouring his late dad. ;"24 days after he stole the show at Foo Fighters Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at London’s Wembley Stadium Shane Hawkins took to the stage once again in Los Angeles on Tuesday night 27th September at the second show honouring his late dad. Just like Wembley 16-year-old Shane powered through an emotionally charged rendition of ‘My Hero’ with the Foos and once again proved he’s a chip off the old block with his energetic and exuberant drumming. However at the end of ‘My Hero’ Shane stayed on stage with Foo Fighters and launched straight into a blistering rendition of their 1995 anthem ‘I’ll Stick Around.’ At the end of ‘I’ll Stick Around’ Dave Grohl said to the crowd “Shane Hawkins ladies and gentlemen!” before the teenager pounded his drum kit once again. You can check out footage of Shane Hawkins’ sensational performance of ‘My Hero’ and ‘I’ll Stick Around’ from two different angles below: Shane Hawkins was one of a several standout performers at the American Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert. ""Showcasing her truly phenomenal vocals Pink performed Hearts ‘Barracuda’ with Nancy Wilson and Foo Fighters ‘Somebody To Love’ with Queen and ‘The Pretender’ with the Foos.

Planet Rock;Whitesnake cancel another concert due to David Coverdale's illness;Whitesnake have been forced to axe another concert due to band leader David Coverdale’s illness. ;"Whitesnake have been forced to axe another concert due to band leader David Coverdale illness. David Coverdale announced on Monday 27th June that he is suffering from an “infection of the sinus and trachea” and doctors have ordered him to rest for five days. Whitesnake’s shows in Milan and Vienna were immediately cancelled however they were yet to make a decision about their concert in Zagreb Croatia on Saturday 2nd July. Unfortunately Coverdale has now confirmed that the Zagreb gig won’t be going ahead however he hopes to recover to complete the rest of the European Farewell Tour. Zagreb is the fourth consecutive show Whitesnake have cancelled after they pulled out of Rock Imperium Festival in Spain on Saturday due to drummer Tommy Aldridge feeling “under the weather.” Guitarist Reb Beach has also missed several shows in recent weeks due to an unspecified illness. David Coverdale’s statement about the Zagreb concert reads: “As stated earlier I am still under doctor’s orders of bed rest and to not sing for 5 days as I recover from this sinus infection. That time frame includes the show in Zagreb this Saturday July 2nd so we are unfortunately going to have to cancel the Zagreb show as well. “This is obviously very sad for us especially our band members that were getting to perform before hometown crowds; Michele Luppi our Italian Stallion was looking forward to playing in Milan in front of his friends and family and of course Dino Jelusic the Pride of Croatia was going to be able to give his all to his hometown of Zagreb. “We regret that this is necessary in our attempt to get healthy and be able to finish the rest of our tour. “Love and Light “XXOO “DC” ";2022-06-29;https://planetradio.co.uk/planet-rock/news/rock-news/whitesnake-zagreb-david-coverdale/;2022-06-30;9999-12-31;1;PLANETROCKWHITESNAKECANCELANOTHERCONCERTDUETODAVIDCOVERDALE'SILLNESS
Planet Rock;Listen to Nita Strauss' heavy new song 'Winner Takes All' featuring Alice Cooper;Nita Strauss has premiered her new single ‘Winner Takes All’ featuring vocals from her close friend and band mate Alice Cooper. ;"Nita Strauss has premiered her new single ‘Winner Takes All’ featuring vocals from her close friend boss and band mate Alice Cooper The driving hard rock track features a typically incredible guitar solo from Nita and it sees Planet Rock’s very own Alice Cooper sing lyrics about triumphing over adversity in his idiosyncratic style. ‘Winner Takes All’ is lifted from Nita Strauss’ second studio album which is due later this year via Sumerian Records. The album also features previous singles ‘Dead Inside’ featuring Disturbed’s David Draiman and ‘The Wolf Inside’ with Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy. Nita Strauss says: ""When we were working on the music for this album there was no question that I wanted to create a song to collaborate with my longtime boss and friend the legendary Alice Cooper. ""“I think the track accomplishes what we set out to do — showcase Alices voice and signature style on the backdrop of a heavy modern rock track."" “After many years of lending my style of playing to Alices music on stage it was truly an honour to work together and hear his voice on one of my songs!"" Earlier this month Nita Strauss announced she was returning to Alice Cooper’s band for his upcoming 2023 tour dates across North America. Nita took a break from Alice’s band in 2022 to tour with Demi Lovato with Kane Roberts stepping in as her replacement. Alice Cooper plays a North American arena tour throughout April and May 2023 before opening for Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe on six dates of their Stadium Tour in the US. In August and September Alice embarks on the Freaks on Parade co-headline arena tour with Rob Zombie. Although there currently aren’t any UK dates as part of Alice Cooper’s touring itinerary he will be gracing these shores in July for a tour with his Hollywood Vampires band mates Joe Perry Johnny Depp and Tommy Henriksen.

Planet Rock;Sharon Osbourne says she 'never lets Ozzy go to award shows';Sharon Osbourne has explained why she never lets her husband Ozzy Osbourne attend awards ceremonies. ;"Sharon Osbourne has explained why she never lets her husband Ozzy Osbourne attend awards ceremonies. Appearing on Talk TV earlier this week Sharon Osbourne was asked about her opinion on actor Angela Bassett at The Oscars who looked unhappy when she lost out in the Best Supporting Actress category to Jamie Lee Curtis. Commenting on Bassett’s “disgust” when the cameras panned onto her Sharon said: “Listen I get it the disappointment. That’s why I never let Ozzy go to award shows. I just won’t do it. You don’t want to be on camera when you didn’t win! “Listen Angela Bassett knew she would be on camera. She did what she felt. She didn’t play the game. She didn’t pretend. She didn’t applaud. She’s got to live with it – she knew what she’s doing she’s an experienced actress.” In 2019 Sharon Osbourne revealed why she refused to let Ozzy pick up Black Sabbath’s Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys. “I was just so pissed off at the Grammys this year because they gave them a Lifetime Achievement award but wouldn’t give it to them on the TV show that we all know as The Grammy Awards” Sharon said. ""They did it at a separate ceremony which goes out on another network later on. I wouldn’t let Ozzy go because I just thought it was shocking what they did to them.” Sharon added “Listen there were artists there that got awards that deserved it too. But I just thought because Sabbath’s catalogue still sells and their last record that was out 6 years ago was no.1 in many countries worldwide so while the other artists they were honouring had great careers and deserved to be honoured they still didn’t have the careers that Sabbath had. “So not to put them on the proper TV show it was like ‘How dare you?’ I was so angry. I just thought ‘F--- you. I am not going to give you the honour of having Ozzy at your s---ty ceremony.’” Ozzy Osbourne scooped two Grammy Awards on Sunday 5th February 2023 however he didn’t attend the crypto.com Arena ceremony in Los Angeles. Metallica’s Robert Trujillo and producer Andrew Watt accepted his Best Rock Album award for ‘Patient Number 9’ on his behalf. Earlier in the night Osbourne also won Best Metal Performance for his lascivious Tony Iommi collaboration ‘Degradation Rules.’ This year’s Grammy Awards ceremony came just four days after Ozzy Osbourne announced his retirement from touring and cancelled his UK & Ireland tour with Judas Priest Rob Halford has since said that Judas Priest are working “frantically” behind the scenes to try and arrange UK tour dates for 2023.

Planet Rock;Florence Black unleash riff-heavy new song 'Start Again' – watch;Florence Black have unleashed their thunderous new single ‘Start Again’ and its accompanying video. ;"Merthyr Tydfil rock powerhouse trio Florence Black have unleashed their thunderous new single ‘Start Again’ and its accompanying video. As we’ve come to expect from Florence Black ‘Start Again’ is a deliciously heavy rock anthem that’s powered by monstrous riffs from vocalistguitarist Tristan Thomas. The track was produced and mixed by Romesh Dodangoda at Long Wave Studios in Cardiff. Commenting on ‘Start Again’ songwriter Tristan Thomas says: ""The song is written about the emotion of starting again being stripped back to your very bones and building again from the ground up trying to retain the good whilst also admitting you’re letting go of both the good and bad from what’s come before.” Reflecting on the striking ‘Start Again’ which depicts a gold-encrusted hand Thomas adds: “The artwork represents ambiguity as to whether the hand still showing slithers of human skin underneath is the person helping you to start again or is a metaphor for being the one to help yourself."" Florence Black play two sold-out single release shows at The Patriot in Newport next month before they rock some of Europe’s biggest festivals including Hellfest Resurrection and Sweden Rock Festival. Following their summer schedule Florence perform on the Main Stage at Planet Rockstock on Thursday 30th November alongside The Bites and Phil Campbell and The Bastard Sons.

Planet Rock;Paul Di'Anno gives fresh verdict on Ghost's cover of Iron Maiden's 'Phantom of the Opera';Former Iron Maiden frontman Paul Di’Anno has given his verdict on Ghost’s recently premiered cover of Maiden’s timeless anthem ‘Phantom of the Opera.’ ;"Former Iron Maiden frontman Paul Di’Anno has given his candid verdict on Ghost’s recently premiered cover of Maiden’s timeless anthem ‘Phantom of the Opera.’ Ghost’s version of Iron Maiden’s 1980 track ‘Phantom of the Opera’ is one of five covers on their ‘Phantomime’ EP which dented the UK album chart last week at Number 8. Shortly after the song premiered on 16th May Paul Di’Anno took to Facebook to lash out at the track writing: ""Everyone asking my opinion on the ghost cover of phantom well not that it matters but it fkn sucks."" Di’Anno swiftly deleted the post which also included three vomit emojis. Two weeks on Paul Di’Anno has appeared on Loaded Radio and he was asked about the Facebook post and his current thoughts on the track. Although his opinion has softened somewhat Di’Anno critiqued Ghost leader Tobias Forge vocals. ""The musics great. I just dont think Tobias f---ing tried hard enough vocally. He sounds a bit plain… And he changed the lyrics slightly… That was a bit weird” Di’Anno said via Blabbermouth Commenting on his Facebook post Di’Anno continued: ""When I first heard it I was probably in a bad mood that day. I said This is f---ing bulls---. But Ive listened to it about three or four times. “The music is pretty damn good actually to be honest with you. But as I said I just feel like Tobias didnt give it some welly. As we say give me some f---ing welly."" ""Regardless of what you think of Ghost Im very happy for them"" Di’Anno added. ""Maybe I was just pissed off with life as usual. The older I get the grumpier I am. F---ing great. Once you get over 50 youve got every f---ing right to say what you want. ""As I said I just wish hed put a bit more effort into the vocals. Thats all."" ""Ghost’s ‘Phantomime EP’ also features covers of Genesis’ ‘Jesus He Knows Me’ Television’s ‘See No Evil’ The Stranglers’ ‘Hanging Around’ and Tina Tuner We Don’t Need Another Hero Thunderdome.""

Planet Rock;Watch Nita Strauss make surprise live return with Alice Cooper;Nita Strauss made a surprise appearance on stage at Alice Cooper’s concert in Colorado on Tuesday 4th October three months after exiting his band. ;Nita Strauss made a surprise appearance on stage at Alice Cooper concert in Colorado last night 4th October. In July Nita Strauss announced she wouldn’t be performing on Alice Cooper’s upcoming tour following an eight-year tenure with the shock rock extraordinaire. A few days later Strauss joined pop singer Demi Lovato’s touring band and Planet Rock’s very own Alice Cooper drafted in his former axeman Kane Roberts for his autumn North American trek. In August Strauss denied she had permanently departed Alice Cooper’s band and hinted she “may have the chance to come back” in 2023. However Strauss’ return has come much sooner than that after she very briefly joined Alice Cooper on stage during the encore of his show at Budweiser Events Center in Loveland Colorado. Sharing guitar duties with Kane Roberts Nita Strauss performed the timeless anthem ‘School’s Out’ alongside Alice and his band. Tweeting a fan’s photo of the performance Strauss wrote: “I had the best time! Thanks for the warm welcome.” Later sharing a series of photos from on stage and backstage Strauss added: “Hurricane meets Hurri-Kane 😝🌪️ @Kane_Roberts “Such a treat getting to not only see the amazing @alicecooper show from the audience for the first time but hop up and join the boys for the encore last night 🥰 thank you all for the warm welcome!” Nita Strauss was in Colorado as she had performed at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver with Demi Lovato the previous evening.

Planet Rock;Steelhouse Festival 2023 review ft. Black Stone Cherry, Airbourne, Kris Barras Band and more;Steelhouse Festival 2023 review featuring Black Stone Cherry, Airbourne, Kris Barras Band, Kira Mac, Elegant Weapons and more. ;"""There’s something about Steelhouse that simply connects embraces and holds together. It has something to do with place and community. This isn’t a new thing; the mountain-top event began in 2011 the brainchild of local buddies Mikey Evans and Max Rhead. Theyve built around them the Steelhouse ‘family’ a small army of volunteers and professionals who look forward to ‘doing their bit’ every year."" But there’s more this time. You’re first aware of it when stuck in traffic on Friday becoming expert in clutch and handbrake control as your vehicle edges up that rocky hill. The event supported as usual by Planet Rock is something everyone wants to be at and it’s been sold out for weeks. This during the worst economic crisis any of us can remember. That growth has enabled Steelhouse to bag its biggest headline act yet Kentucky legends Black Stone Cherry whose recent Planet Rock fave ‘Out Of Pocket’ aptly summarises the difficult times we’re living through. When you reach the top of that hill you’ll probably be greeted by Alan Evans Mikey’s 80-year-old dad. See what I mean? The spirit of family both literal and by association prevails. To **Dan Byrne** falls the honour of opening the whole shebang and rise to the occasion he does despite this being only his third gig as a solo act. The former Revival Black singer plays muscular hard rock in the tradition of Whitesnake and Skin – ‘Like Animals’ comes with suitably libidinous thrust while ‘Death Of Me’ is a bluesy ballad that showcases Dan’s multi-faceted voice. Newcomers **Jordan Red** also show potential their slick hard rock redolent of Swedish band H.E.A.T in its polished surfaces and elevated hooks. Time and patience could see them push for promotion. **The Karma Effect** are probably in that position already. They’ve grown in confidence even since February when they impressed us at Planet Rock’s Winter’s End. Theirs is a bluesy strut that catwalks its way into hearty hard rock like ‘Steal Your Heart’ ‘Mercy’ and brilliant set closer ‘Testify’. It’s easy to compare them to Rival Sons but there’s something of Reef’s bass-humping surf-ready groove in their DNA too. It was with the latter that we most recently saw **When Rivers Meet** whose live shows are never less than an aural and visual treat. They’re exceptional today – soulful blues led by Grace Bond’s heaven-sent vocals and husband Aaron’s cooler-than-thou guitar work. There’s an almost preternatural clarity to their sound a sense of space that enables all elements to stand up and be counted. Add songs as good as ‘Walking On The Wire’ and ‘He’ll Drive You Crazy’ which builds to a symphonic finish via Grace’s electric violin and you have Friday’s stand-out performance. The sight of Ginger Wildheart’s custom Hagstrom guitar poignantly propped on stage creates a wash of feelings. There’s sadness of course that Ginger can’t be here with his ‘other’ band **The Sinners** but also a sense of relief that he’s now tackling his mental health challenges with professional help. The word ‘genius’ is overused but Ginger is that and we want him happy and well a point that The Sinners’ Neil Ivison emphasises during his band’s performance – which is boosted by Black Star Riders and Wayward Sons guitarist Sam Wood. Playing heartland country rock Ivison turns out to be an amusing host even congratulating the organisers on “the quality of the water pressure” backstage. There are Quo and Georgia Satellites covers and with the hungover country rock drawl of new song ‘Walk Of Shame’ and ‘Lately Always’ this is – against the odds – a success. Their Winter’s End performance removed any doubt that the **Kris Barras Band** can effectively headline festivals – and we’re not just saying that because he is clearly the most physically intimidating frontman you can think of. Barras a former MMA fighter has proved himself all over again. This is not only a commanding performance but you can see how the audience has grown with the band. On this stage two years ago the multi-talented musician’s hard-as-nails stare broke when the crowd carried on singing ‘My Parade’ then unreleased even after the band had finished debuting it – and that was just a sign of things to come. Tonight’s set is full of sandpaper vocals meaty riffs and at its best perfectly directed hooks with Barras as nimble-fingered a guitarist as any. It’s tempting to assume that his music is all muscle but it has surprising soul in its genes too. With headliners Airbourne and special guests Those Damn Crows both doing stints at Planet Rock’s busy signing tent there are long queues snaking around the site early on. Openers **Dead Man’s Whiskey** nevertheless manage to make themselves known. While the outfit aren’t breaking new ground or solving global famine they’re a decent blood-and-thunder heavy rock act. The response afforded to ‘Make You Proud’ about singer Nico Rogers’ mother who survived brain cancer sees the frontman genuinely moved – a sweet moment. There’s a few of those during **Austin Gold**’s set too. The superb ‘Mountain’ with its ascendent chorus always seemed tailor made for this stage. The Peterborough rockers have cherry-picked the best things that Foo Fighters and Bad Company do and given those influences their own twist. There’s light and shade in the band’s thoughtful hard rock – frontman David James Smith ensures that the guitar notes he picks out actually matter. During the magnificent ‘Never End’ set to be a new single and video the crowd take up the song’s skin-tingling mantra “when it all goes down keep going” – and sing it straight back. A ‘My Parade’ moment? Let’s hope so. There’s never a bad time to see **Black Spiders**. Featuring Planet Rock’s very own Wyatt on drums the band have stepped in at short notice to replace the sadly unwell Blues Pills. Their addition is even more noteworthy given that they have a second festival to play later – Derbyshire’s Rock & Blues Custom. Never short of a quip frontman Pete Spiby likens his band to “Phil Collins at Live Aid playing two countries in one day”. As ever they’re a joy to behold – three guitars filthy riffs and rabble-rousing hooks. ‘Destroyer’ nails a chunk of Marilyn Manson’s ‘mOBSCENE’ into its walls while the pairing of ‘KISS Tried To Kill Me’ and recent barnstormer ‘A Rat Is A Rat’ will take some topping from any band on this bill. Belgium’s **Black Mirrors** seem somewhat out of place after this – the PA is surprisingly quiet which means their velvety grooves and Marcella Di Troia’s big vocals don’t punch like they ought. There’s plenty to admire – ‘Lost In Desert’ is a cross between earthy rock and avant-garde songstress Poppy while ‘Burning Warriors’ rides out on a florid musical freakout – but the lack of familiarity is a dividing factor and they’d certainly be better in a sweaty club. More overseas visitors Canada’s **The Damn Truth** sweep around in a blur of leopard print pink guitar purple boots and striped flares. If we could get close enough they’d probably smell of patchouli too. ‘This Is Who We Are Now’ is their defiant self-introducing anthem but there’s many a tonal change within their ear-catching set. Singer Lee-La Baum likens her band to a group of travelling hippies and her Joplin-kissed vocal talent and constant expressions of delight signify that being in The Damn Truth must be as fun as it looks. ‘Fun’ isn’t the first word you’d use to describe local heroes **Florence Black** or at least not in the frivolous sense. Few rock trios this side of Motörhead feature quite this much heft. Classic rock? It’s closer to Metallica today. There are call-and-response hooks a furious performance from drummer Perry Davies especially during ‘On The Ropes’ and perhaps the biggest bass sound of the weekend courtesy of Jordan Evans. Yes they finish with the comparatively restrained ‘Sun And Moon’ preceded by their always enjoyable bludgeon of Budgie classic ‘Breadfan’ but make no mistake this is a more honed hungrier and downright meaner Florence Black than we’ve seen before. During ‘Zulu’ someone taps us on the shoulder and shouts: “This is ‘kicking somebody’s arse music’!” Agreed. There’s also something we can agree on about **Those Damn Crows**: this band will be back – as headliners. There’s never been a better example of a group and a festival that has grown together almost organically interconnected that whole family thing again. Tonight they’re the finished article infinitely better than they were just two years ago on this same stage. ‘Man On Fire’ and ‘Wake Up Sleepwalker’ are songs of such international poise that even greater things beckon and the Steelhouse crowd understandably adores them. “Just shush for a moment” jokes frontman Shane Greenhall “it’s like talking to my nine-year-old son!” The only odd thing about tonight’s championship-winning performance is that when they play ‘This Time I’m Ready’ near enough the finest song they’ve ever written and certainly their most emotional the crowd mysteriously turns off. That surreal moment aside Those Damn Crows win big. **Airbourne** frontman Joel O’Keeffe has been hobbling around backstage with his smashed right foot in a surgical boot. There’s no rock n’roll story behind this – he kicked a door and the door won – but what is remarkable is that it barely slows him down on stage. The never-say-die Australian rockers sound exactly like they always do with everything louder than everything else. It’s mental over-the-top hard rocking bedlam and of course Steelhouse loves them for it. There are even circle pits during ‘Breakin’ Outta Hell’ and on stage there’s a bit of old school co-ordinated guitar swinging a ride out into the audience from Joel and his customary trick of smashing a beer can open on his head proving his cranium is made of stronger stuff than his toes. Meanwhile Justin Street and Jarrad Morrice bassist and six-stringer sprint in opposing directions like the Red Arrows synchro pair. In a nod to their location they play ‘Steel Town’ for the first time since 2011. Mission accomplished. Magazine editors would traditionally warn festival reviewers not to waste column space writing about the weather – but sadly pretending the latter doesn’t affect things is as good as lying. To Steelhouse’s credit today’s relentless rain doesn’t actually stop anything from happening. Even after the show Planet Rock’s Ian Danter is entertaining mud-encrusted festival stalwarts with a DJ set under cover thankfully with Shane and Ronnie from Those Damn Crows stepping up to offer ‘support’. Much earlier though **Troy Redfern** has the deeply unenviable task of being the first onstage act. The only thing muddier than the sound is the stuff glued to the boots of the few people braving the elements this early. Troy’s groovy slide guitar and sweet summery sounds belong in less clouded climes. It simply isn’t his day – but that day will come. Far better suited to the conditions and luxuriating in them are professional gloom purveyors **Empyre**. Like a more contained Paradise Lost the band’s dark emotive melancholia is impressive but has been known to fall on deaf ears in sunnier conditions. Henrik Steenholdt and men take a deserved if somewhat ironic victory today. **The Cruel Knives** work like troopers to make connections in the drizzle. Their stop-start energy a genre guessing game is neither pure rock or punk but something incorporating all of the above. Featuring songs that keep you on edge they’re an outfit who know how to hold the attention and in former Heavens Basement guitarist Sid Glover they have a great six-stringer who could probably turn his hand to any musical brand. **Kira Mac** are unperturbed by the conditions spending more time on the stage’s unsheltered catwalk than any other act today. “We’re northerners!” is how singer Rhiannon Hill justifies the matter. Much loved by Planet Rock listeners the band smash through the likes of ‘Hit Me Again’ ‘Chaos Is Calling’ and ‘Scorned’ with the co-ordinated grace of a band clawing its way into ever higher echelons. In contrast The Vintage Caravan have come from even further north Iceland but need every bit of the sense of humour they’re blessed with. Despite the quirky tunes there’s not enough connection here to engage an audience that needs at least a drip-feed of something it recognises. For what it’s worth they’re ace in small clubs. Aside from the headliners it’s **The Answer** that provide the set of the day. Singer Cormac Neeson calls for “good karma and positive vibes” but in reality he’s the one providing it. At times he dances with arms aloft as if being controlled by a smirking puppeteer but it’s the songs – ‘Blood Brother’ ‘Under The Sky’ ‘Sundowners’ and ‘Come Follow Me’ – that grip and even energize the hard-pressed audience. At the end during ‘Preachin’s irresistible twisted gospel Cormac climbs down into the crowd emerging finally with face smeared with mud and dirty handprints on his once white jacket. This compelling performance was the answer we needed in more ways than one. ""Elegant Weapons making their UK debut are a vehicle for the talents of Judas Priest guitarist Richie Faulkner and are fronted by rent-a-throat Ronnie Romero clearly the vocalist of choice for star guitarists needing singers. Faulker is never less than impressive both as a musician and as a human being having survived a heart condition that would’ve killed most people. Hunched over his Flying Vee all fibrous tone and glorious note-making he’s the walking epitome of metal. A cover of ‘War Pigs’ seems suitably apocalyptic with eerily lit trees at either side of the stage being almost pulled apart by the stiff wind and sheets of illuminated rain. Its a decent introduction but one wonders how much more there can be to come given the members’ other occupations."" To have **Black Stone Cherry** eight albums old and genuine top shelf rock stars up the mountain is all the evidence you need to understand how far Steelhouse has come. You can kid yourself it’s the main stage at Download when this astute and utterly professional act are banging out classics like ‘Me And Mary Jane’ ‘Like I Roll’ and the aforementioned zeitgeist-capturing ‘Out Of Pocket’. Then frontman Chris Robertson talks about how petrified he was in the bus coming up the mountain honestly it’s not that bad and you remember exactly where you are and what this all means. Also Black Stone Cherry are a perfect headliner a positive unifying force that instinctively evokes a sense of hearth and home; the importance of community. It is as they sing ‘In My Blood’. As they bow out with a buoyant ‘Blame It On The Boom Boom’ and ‘Lonely Train’ the latter a trip back to where it all began for them you do get a poignant sense of distance travelled. For them and for all of us.

Planet Rock;John Lydon slams 'disgusting' and 'awful' Eurovision ;Public Image Ltd frontman John Lydon has slammed The Eurovision Song Contest despite his ambitions to represent Ireland in Liverpool this May. ;"Public Image Ltd frontman John Lydon has slammed The Eurovision Song Contest despite his ambitions to represent Ireland in Liverpool this May. On Monday morning 9th January Public Image Ltd made the surprise announcement that they were vying to fly the flag for Ireland at Eurovision 2023 with their poignant new song ‘Hawaii.’ Penned by John Lydon the track is an open love letter to the Sex Pistols singer’s wife of five decades Nora who is currently battling Alzheimer’s. Public Image Ltd will perform ‘Hawaii’ on Ireland’s The Late Late Show on Friday 3rd February 2023 from 9.30pm alongside the other Ireland hopefuls. Despite entering the early stages of the competition this year Lydon told Cormac Ó hEadhra on RTE’s Radio 1 that he shuns Eurovision each May. “It’s absolutely awful the songs” Lydon blasted. “The whole thing of it is disgusting to me. I’m a songwriter I perform live and these shows just come across as so dreadfully phoney to me. “But look we’re giving it a chance to break out of that mould.” Asked how he’s planning to shake things up at Eurovision Lydon said: “I’ve no idea. Apparently I have to do karaoke over a backing track.” However although he strongly dislikes Eurovision Lydon said he’s pleased he’s in the mix to perform at the finals. “‘What a fantastic opportunity these people have given me” he said via Metro More importantly however he’s looking forward to seeing Nora’s reaction: “My wife when she sees this it’s going to melt her Alzheimer’s or not. It’s the most rewarding thing.” If they do represent Ireland Public Image Ltd. will perform at the Eurovision semi-finals on either 9th or 11th May where they will aim to land a place at the grand final at Liverpool’s M&S Bank Arena on Saturday 13th May. ‘Hawaii’ is available on all digital platforms right now and will be released on limited edition 7″ vinyl later in the year. Public Image. Ltd will also be releasing a new studio album this year.

Planet Rock;Queen and Journey songs immortalised in National Recording Registry;Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Journey's Don’t Stop Believin have been named among the 25 recordings selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.;Queen ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and Journey ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ have been named among the 25 recordings selected for preservation in America’s National Recording Registry. Since 2002 the Librarian of Congress has immortalised a list of recordings in the National Recording Registry that are deemed ‘culturally historically or aesthetically significant andor inform or reflect life in the United States.’ 50 albums songs and audio recordings were inducted in the inaugural year and since then 25 have been added annually. Queen’s 1975 rock epic ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and Journey’s enduring anthem ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ from 1981 have both made the list this year. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden says: “The National Recording Registry reflects the diverse music and voices that have shaped our nation’s history and culture through recorded sound. “The national library is proud to help preserve these recordings and we welcome the public’s input. We received about 1000 public nominations this year for recordings to add to the registry.” The recordings selected for the National Recording Registry bring the number of titles on the registry to 600 representing a small portion of the national library’s gargantuan recorded sound collection of nearly 4 million items. Commenting on the legacy of ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ former Journey singer Steve Perry says: “That song over the years has become something that has a life of its own. “It’s about the people who’ve embraced it and found the lyrics to be something they can relate to and hold onto and sing.” Queen said in a brief statement: “We are honoured ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ has been inducted into the National Recording Registry Class of 2022!” 1 National Recording Registry 2022 Selections“Harlem Strut” — James P.

The 76-year-old Country legend added: “I really do not want votes to be split because of me so I must respectfully bow out.” In a separate interview with Fox News on Thursday Dolly said that being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame “would be like putting ACDC in the Country Music Hall of Fame.” In response to Dolly Parton’s request the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame praised the singer in a glowing statement but insisted that she’s still on the ballot. The Cleveland Ohio institution said: ""All of us in the music community have seen Dolly Parton’s thoughtful note expressing her feeling that she has not earned the right to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to her incredible talent as an artist her humility is another reason Dolly is a beloved icon by millions of fans around the world. “From its inception Rock and Roll has had deep roots in Rhythm & Blues and country music. It is not defined by any one genre rather a sound that moves youth culture. Dolly Parton’s music impacted a generation of young fans and influenced countless artists that followed. Her nomination to be considered for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame followed the same process as all other artists who have been considered. “Dolly’s recommendation along with the other 16 nominees for the class of 2022 was sent out earlier this month to our 1100 general ballot voters the majority of whom are artists themselves for consideration for induction at our ceremony. “We are in awe of Dolly’s brilliant talent and pioneering spirit and are proud to have nominated her for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.” Dolly Parton isn’t the only 2022 nominee to speak out against the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in the past week. On Sunday soul singer Dionne Warwick said she doesn’t ‘give a damn’ if she’s inducted this year. “Im not a rock and roller” she told Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “I’ve been interviewed on this subject many times.

Planet Rock;Brian May insists Freddie Mercury would have wanted Queen to go on with Adam Lambert;Brian May has insisted that Freddie Mercury would have wanted Queen to continue with their current vocalist Adam Lambert. ;"Guitar legend Brian May has insisted that Freddie Mercury would have wanted Queen to continue with their current vocalist Adam Lambert Since the untimely passing of Freddie Mercury Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor have revived Queen as a touring outfit with two guest vocalists – Paul Rodgers from 2004 to 2009 and Adam Lambert from 2011. Bassist John Deacon quit the music industry and public life in 1997 shortly after recording the Queen single ‘No-One but You Only the Good Die Young’ and he hasn’t been involved in the two subsequent incarnations of the band. In an extensive new interview with Guitar World celebrating the 50th anniversary of Queen’s self-titled debut album Brian May was asked what the chances were of a studio album with Adam Lambert. “Well we have been in the studio” May said. “We did knock a few ideas around in the middle of one of those tours. But it just never quite reached the place where we felt it was going to be right. So we haven’t pursued it so far. That’s all I can tell you. “So I really don’t k “There are people on Instagram who get annoyed with me: ‘Why are you still carrying on without Freddie?’ And I go ‘Don’t tell me what to do! I do what I feel that I should be doing.’ “There are people who feel like we shouldn’t even be going on stage without Freddie. But I think that would have been very sad and it’s not what Freddie would have wanted either. He would have wanted us to continue developing. And of course because we are continuing and developing it keeps that legacy alive. “You know I often have this conversation with Freddie’s sister Kash. She gets those questions as well: ‘Why are they doing this without Freddie?’ And she completely gets what we’re doing. She says ‘This is what Freddie would have wanted. He would not want have wanted his songs or the band’s songs to become museum pieces. He would have wanted them to live.’ And that’s what we’re doing. We make the Queen legacy live.

Planet Rock;Unearthed Freddie Mercury lyric sheets reveal original title of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody';Freddie Mercury’s never-before-seen handwritten ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ lyrics have revealed the song’s surprising original title. ;"""Freddie Mercury never-before-seen handwritten lyrics for Queen Bohemian Rhapsody have revealed the song’s surprising original title. "" The lyrics are part of Freddie Mercury’s largely unseen private collection from his beloved London home Garden Lodge in Kensington which will go on display in London this summer ahead of an auction at Sotheby’s in September. Freddie bought Garden Lodge with his long-term friend Mary Austin and he left the property to Austin in his will. Written in black and blue ballpoint pen and pencil the early draft for ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ was penned by Freddie in 1974 across 15 pages of stationery from the now defunct British Midland Airways. One page reveals that Mercury originally planned to call the song ‘Mongolian Rhapsody’ before crossing out Mongolian and replacing it with ‘Bohemian’. Another page reveals that the line “Mama just killed a man” was going to have a wartime narrative of “Mama There’s a war began I’ve got to leave tonight.” Elsewhere Freddie’s scribblings for the operatic section ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ include the words and phrases “Galileo” “Fandango” “Scaramouche” and “Thunderbolts and lightning” that were used in the final track alongside unused words “Matador” and “Belladonna.” The lyrics are expected to fetch between £800000 and £1.2 million when they go under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London in September. Dr. Gabriel Heaton Sotheby’s Books & Manuscripts Specialist comments: ""Thanks to the sheer complexity of the music to Bohemian Rhapsody and especially its unusual and varied structure the song rests especially heavily on its lyrics to lend its coherence. “In these pages we see Freddie Mercury wrestling in grand operatic terms with profound themes – sin damnation stoic acceptance – and witness the great efforts he goes to pinpointing precisely the right words to embody these emotions and to create the most extraordinary narrative. “Quite unlike anything that had been released before Bohemian Rhapsody was the band’s greatest risk which swiftly became their greatest hit.” ""Other handwritten lyrics up for auction include ‘Somebody To Love’ ‘Dont Stop Me Now’ ‘Bicycle Race’ ‘If You Cant Beat Them’ ‘Killer Queen’ ‘Love of my Life’ and ‘We Are the Champions.’ "" Featuring more than 1500 items including stage costumes handwritten lyrics fine and decorative arts Japanese art precious objects and a trove of personal belongings the contents of Garden Lodge will go on display at a month-long exhibition in a 16000 square foot space at Sotheby’s in London called Freddie Mercury: A World of His Own. The main exhibition takes place from 4th August to 5th September 2023 following smaller touring exhibitions at Sotheby’s in New York Los Angeles and Hong Kong. After the public display the lots will go under the hammer at six separate auctions in early September.

KISS’s swansong End of the World Tour kicked off way back in January 2019 it will carry on way into 2023 with the final date - so far - scheduled for Tonsberg in Norway on 15th July. The End of the World Tour previously featured a UK arena tour in 2019 and a headline slot at Download Festival this summer and earlier this week the band announced a ‘final’ UK leg for summer 2023 Commenting on their continued live shows Paul Stanley told Ultimate Classic Rock ""Were far from done. Id like to say that this is the end of the road but they keep paving more road. ""The only people that seems to bother are the people who hate us. Quite honestly theyve never mattered and they still dont. “The people who want to see us are thrilled. The people who wish wed go away are going to have to wait. And in one form or another were never gonna go."" Explaining how KISS will continue – even without their current band members – Stanley said: ""Kiss is like an army or a sports team. When the MVP is no longer playing or retired the team doesnt call it quits. ""“On a battlefield an army when they lose soldiers doesnt wave the white flag. Somebody else picks up the weapon and runs forward. So in one form or another I believe there will always be a KISS.” "" Musing about his own hypothetical replacement Stanley said: “Is there somebody else out there who could pick up and wave the flag? Absolutely. Im not saying there should be a copy of me. Im not a copy of anybody else. But Im certainly a combination of many people that inspired me.""

The good-looking ones with you here"" The 71 year old metal legend then goes on to explain in a more sombre tone that ""I do have just a very personal very very personal message for everybody."" Hesitantly Nicko continues ""I wasnt well earlier this year as some of you have quite rightly noticed"" referring to speculation by fans during Maidens current leg of The Future Past Tour that some of his drum parts were sounding different compared to normal. ""I will be writing a little press note if you like explaining everything thats happened to me and where I was in January of this year... with my health issues that I went through."" ""You can read Nickos full press note below.""

It left me paralyzed on my right side from my shoulder on down of course I was very worried that my career was over but with the love and support from my wife Rebecca and family my doctors especially Julie my OT Occupational Therapist and my Maiden family I was able to bounce back to somewhere near 70% recovered. After 10 weeks of intense therapy it was almost time to start rehearsals for our tour.

Planet Rock;Myles Kennedy reveals his biggest regret about his Led Zeppelin jam sessions;Myles Kennedy has recalled an awkward moment that happened during his jam sessions with Led Zeppelin back in 2008. ;"Slash and Alter Bridge vocalist Myles Kennedy has recalled an awkward moment that happened during his famous jam sessions with Led Zeppelin back in the late noughties. Led Zeppelin of course reunited for the one-off Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in December 2007 and despite massive demand from fans for a world tour Robert Plant ruled out a full-scale reunion. The following year Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones famously held some sessions where they jammed with potential new vocalists including Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and Alter Bridge’s Myles Kennedy. Heart’s Ann Wilson also threw her hat in the ring however as she exclusively told Planet Rock in 2021 she was met with “crickets.” In a fresh interview with US radio station 95.5 KLOS Myles Kennedy revealed how the jam sessions came into fruition and he reflected upon his biggest regret about the experience. Explaining how he first met Jason Bonham on the set of the 2001 musical comedy Rock Star Myles Kennedy said via Blabbermouth: ""We got to talking about his fathers John Bonham legacy and how much I appreciated it. And he was genuinely… I was really impressed with him and just how proud he was of his dad and everything that he achieved. And that was really beautiful to see. “So fast forward about - I dont know; was it six seven years whenever it was I get this text from Jason and hes like Can you call me?"" He continued: ""So I buzzed him. It was at night. And Jason was just basically Look Im here in London. Would you be interested in coming over this weekend? Im jamming with some friends. And Im like Im on tour. Just out of curiosity who are your friends? So when he lays out who his friends are Im just like Okay. Yeah I think we can make that work! ""So yeah it was crazy. I flew to London a few days later. And they let me know what songs to kind of have prepared. And we jammed - we jammed for a day - and its something I will never ever forget. ""Then they reached out and asked if Id be interested in coming back a few months later and we jammed some more - I think four more days or something. It was the stuff dreams are made of. If someone would have told me when I was a kid listening to In Through The Out Door or any of those records like Youre gonna be in a room jamming these songs with those guys someday … It was just such a trip."" Commenting on the one cringeworthy moment that happened during the auditions Kennedy said: “There was one moment where I had a bit of a Chris Farley late US comedian moment. ""“You know when Chris Farley when hes interviewing Paul McCartney on Saturday Night Live in 1993 and theres that moment when he kind of smacks himself on the head like How could I have been so stupid and said that? I had one of those moments. Id been in the room for a few hours and we were taking a little break. "" ""I just had to say it cause Im such a fan. I just looked at them both and thanked them and I was like You guys basically wrote the blueprint for everything that guys like us… I just had to get it out. And they just kind of looked at me. They were very sweet about it. But it was one of those things where I was like I probably shouldnt have said that. But it was great.""

Planet Rock;Lionel Richie makes cameo in Foo f;Foo Fighters have premiered the official trailer for their upcoming horror movie Studio 666. ;"Foo Fighters have premiered the official trailer for their upcoming horror movie Studio 666. The two-and-a-half-minute teaser clip features cameo appearances from Slayer axeman Kerry King and soul legend Lionel Richie and it follows Foo Fighters as they decamp to a new recording studio – Studio 666 – to record their new studio album. Once they arrive at the haunted Studio 666 Dave Grohl turns into a demonic figure and all kinds of macabre things start happening. Directed by BJ McDonnell and with script by Jeff Buhler and Rebecca Hughes Studio 666 is based on a story by Dave Grohl. A plot synopsis reads: ‘In Studio 666 the legendary rock band Foo Fighters move into an Encino mansion steeped in grisly rock and roll history to record their much-anticipated 10th album. ‘Once in the house Dave Grohl finds himself grappling with supernatural forces that threaten both the completion of the album and the lives of the band.’ The feature length movie will hit over 2000 North American cinemas on Friday 25th February 2022 and the international release date will be revealed in due course. Other stars in Studio 666 include Whitney Cummings Leslie Grossman Will Forte Jenna Ortega and Jeff Garlin. “After decades of ridiculous music videos and numerous music documentaries under our collective belts it was finally time to take it to the next level… A full-length feature horror comedy film” comments Dave Grohl. “Like most things Foo Studio 666 began with a far-fetched idea that blossomed into something bigger than we ever imagined possible. Filmed at the same house where we recorded our latest album ‘Medicine at Midnight’ — told you that place was haunted! — we wanted to recapture the classic magic that all of our favourite rock and roll movies had but with a twist: hilarious gore that f---ing rocks. “And now with the help of Tom Ortenberg and the team at Open Road Films we can finally let this cat out of the bag after keeping it our best kept secret for two years. Be ready to laugh scream and headbang in your popcorn. Studio 666 will f--- you up.” Studio 666 is produced by Roswell Films’ and Therapy Studios’ John Ramsay & James A. Rota. Executive Producers are John Silva Kristen Welsh John Cutcliffe Gaby Skolnek Dave Grohl Nate Mendel Taylor Hawkins Pat Smear Chris Shiflett Rami Jaffee James Masciello Matthew Sidari Mitchell Zhang and Tom Ortenberg.

The 64-year-old rocker confirmed the news of his appearance on Dolly Parton new record in a Twitter post last night 23rd March. Updating fans on how he’s spending his time during the two-month gap on Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard’s stadium tour Sixx tweeted: “Played bass on a song for Dolly Parton yesterday. Been back in the gym again to beat the jet-lag from the tour and enjoying family time. “Had a great interview with Sweden Rock magazine and they might even feature some of my street photography.” Big name artists already confirmed for Dolly Parton’s rock album include Fleetwood Mac Stevie Nicks former Journey frontman Steve Perry Creedence Clearwater Revival’s John Fogerty Beatles and Wings legend Paul McCartney and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler ""P!nk and Brandi Carlile will sing on a rendition of The Rolling Stones ‘I Cant Get No Satisfaction’ and Cher lends her voice to a track."" Parton has also expressed her desire to reunite Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page and Robert Plant to perform on her version of ‘Stairway To Heaven.’ In February 2022 Dolly Parton was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and told Billboard at the time: “I’m not expecting that I’ll get in. But if I do I’ll immediately next year have to put out a great rock and roll album — which I’ve wanted to do for years.” A few weeks later Parton announced she was “bowing out” of the shortlist as she did not “feel that I have earned the right” to be included on the Rock Hall’s list. However Parton later made a U-turn and she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November alongside Judas Priest Eminem Duran Duran Lionel Richie Carly Simon Eurythmics and Pat Benatar. True to her word Parton has pressed on with making her rock album which she has called ‘Rock Star’ and she confirmed in 2022 that it will include versions of tracks by The Rolling Stones Led Zeppelin Prince Journey Lynyrd Skynyrd and many more. Dolly Parton performed two tracks at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles in November – a new track called ‘Rockin’ and her 1973 anthem ‘Jolene.’ For the latter song Parton was flanked by a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee supergroup consisting of P!nk Eurythmics Simon LeBon Pat Benetar Sheryl Crow Brandi Carlile Zac Brown Band and Rob Halford. Clearly revelling in the “superjam” of ‘Jolene’ Judas Priest’s Rob Halford stood at the front of the stage and shared vocals with Dolly Parton.

Planet Rock;John Fogerty acquires rights to Creedence Clearwater Revival's songs after 50 years;John Fogerty has regained control of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s back catalogue after more than 50 years. ;"Ending a decades-long legal battle John Fogerty has regained control of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s back catalogue after more than 50 years. The 77-year-old rock icon has acquired a majority interest in the global publishing rights to his vast Creedence Clearwater Revival catalogue from Concord Records. The deal was for an undisclosed fee. Seminal songs in the deal include ‘Proud Mary’ ‘Fortunate Son’ ‘Bad Moon Rising’ ‘Up Around the Bend’ and ‘Have You Ever Seen Rain.’ John Fogerty was not in dispute with Concord. The bitter and lengthy legal battle stemmed from music and film mogul’s Saul Zaentz so-called ‘draconian’ contract with CCR in the late 1960s. Zaentz’ record label Fantasy Records owned the catalogue. Concord bought Creedence Clearwater Revival’s discography 19 years ago in 2004 and swiftly restored royalties to Fogerty in good faith. Sharing the good news John Fogerty said: “As of this January I own my own songs again. This is something I thought would never be a possibility. After 50 years I am finally reunited with my songs. I also have a say in where and how my songs are used. Up until this year that is something I have never been able to do. ""I am looking forward to touring and celebrating this year! I want to thank Concord for helping to make all this happen. And I am excited for new ideas and a renewed interest in my music... like a revival."" Speaking to Billboard about the acquisition Fogerty said: “The happiest way to look at it is yeah it isn’t everything. It’s not a 100% win for me but it’s sure better than it was. I’m really kind of still in shock. I haven’t allowed my brain to really actually start feeling it yet.” John Fogerty’s last UK concert took place at Bluesfest at London’s The O2 almost five years ago.

The New York Times;Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age Singer, Dies at 57;Known for his deep, world-weary voice, he was part of a generation of Seattle musicians who put grunge music on the map.;"Mark Lanegan, a singer for Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age and an integral part of the 1980s and 1990s grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest, died on Tuesday at his home in Killarney, Ireland. He was 57.SKH Music, a management company, confirmed his death in a statement but did not specify a cause. By his own account, Mr. Lanegan had struggled with drug use in the past and been hospitalized with Covid-19 in March 2021.Though his stints in Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age and the Gutter Twins (a collaboration with Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs) never brought him the kind of fame achieved by other Seattle grunge bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden, Mr. Lanegan nevertheless drew attention for his deep, world-weary voice that could take a song to both soaring heights and melancholy lows.He met the founding members of Screaming Trees in high school, and the band released its first album in 1986. The group’s aesthetic evolved, marrying angsty lyrics and alternately chugging and wailing guitars. The band helped pioneer the fusion of heavy metal and punk rock later known as grunge, and delivered it to the mainstream in songs like “Nearly Lost You,” which also appeared on the soundtrack of Cameron Crowe’s 1992 grunge rom-com, “Singles,” and “All I Know” in 1996.The Seattle scene found critical success in the 1990s, by which time the Screaming Trees were a key player but not a marquee act.Mr. Lanegan’s solo career began with the 1990 album “The Winding Sheet,” which featured guest appearances by Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. In 1996, after Screaming Trees released its seventh album in 10 years, it went on hiatus, before splitting in 2000; a final album of recordings made in the late 1990s came out in 2011.Mr. Lanegan later joined the ever-changing lineup of Josh Homme’s hard rock band Queens of the Stone Age, earning two Grammy Award nominations with the group in 2002 and 2003. He also collaborated with the Belle and Sebastian singer Isobel Campbell, starting with an EP in 2004 called “Time Is Just the Same.” Two full-length albums followed in 2008 and 2010.In an interview with the YouTube channel FaceCulture in 2012, Mr. Lanegan talked about how he liked to preserve the mystery behind the meanings of his songs.“I would never impose my interpretation of a song on anybody else,” he said, “because for me, the music that I’ve always loved the most is music that nobody told me what it meant.”Mark William Lanegan was born on Nov. 25, 1964, in Ellensburg, Wash., a small farming city. His parents, Dale and Floy, were teachers, according to his well-received 2020 book, “Sing Backwards and Weep: A Memoir.”One of his first memories of music, he said in the YouTube interview, was when he was at a fishing pond with his father and heard a song and thought, “Oh, man, that’s sad-sounding.” He later discovered that the song was the 1974 track “Love Hurts” by the Scottish rock band Nazareth.Offstage, Mr. Lanegan was candid about his drug use and a self-destructive lifestyle. In his memoir, he chronicled his journey from a “self-loathing redneck” to a rock star to a homeless heroin addict. In “Devil in a Coma,” a second memoir he released in December, he wrote about how he had been sick with Covid-19, which confined him to a hospital for months.He is survived by his wife, Shelley, SKH Music said. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.In July 2019, Mr. Lanegan appeared on the podcast “Come to Where I’m From,” where he talked about how humbling it was when fans related how his music had changed their lives.“It’s kind of hard,” he said, “to think that your music is something that affects other people the way that the music you loved affected you.”Ben Sisario contributed reporting.";2022-02-23;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/arts/music/mark-lanegan-dead.html;2022-02-23;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESMARKLANEGAN,SCREAMINGTREESANDQUEENSOFTHESTONEAGESINGER,DIESAT57

But he was also one of the first D.J.s to introduce Hong Kong’s homegrown Cantopop to English-speaking listeners in the 1970s, said Cheung Man-sun, a former assistant director of broadcasting at Radio Television Hong Kong.“It’s rare and exceptional,” said Mr. Cheung, who did much to popularize Cantopop as a Chinese-language D.J. He said Mr. Cordeiro would translate songs’ Cantonese lyrics into English for a weekly segment on “All the Way With Ray,” his long-running late-night show.“His spirit of loving music influenced the other D.J.s and raised the status of Chinese music,” Mr. Cheung said.Reinaldo Maria Cordeiro was born in Hong Kong on Dec. 12, 1924, the fifth of six children in a family of Portuguese descent. His father, Luiz Gonzaga Cordeiro, a bank clerk, left his mother, Livia Pureza dos Santos, and the children in 1930, according to Mr. Cordeiro’s 2021 autobiography, “All the Way With Ray.”Mr. Cordeiro attended St. Joseph’s College, a prestigious Roman Catholic secondary school, where he credited a teacher with giving him a solid grounding in English. In his late teens, during Japan’s World War II occupation of Hong Kong, he spent years in a refugee camp in Macau, then a Portuguese colony, with his mother and sisters.After the war, the family returned to Hong Kong. Mr. Cordeiro briefly worked at a prison, then spent four years as a clerk at the bank where his father worked. To escape the tedium of that job, he played drums at night with a jazz trio.In 1949, Mr. Cordeiro was hired for his first radio job: writing scripts for on-air hosts at a local station, Radio Rediffusion. Within the year, he was hosting his first show, “Progressive Jazz.” His big break came in 1964, a few years after he had become a producer for the city’s main broadcaster, Radio Hong Kong, which is now Radio Television Hong Kong.In London, where he’d gone for training at the BBC, Mr. Cordeiro interviewed rock bands like the Searchers and Manfred Mann — as well as the Beatles, who were coming to Hong Kong.“I heard it’s a swinging town, or city, or place,” Ringo Starr said when Mr. Cordeiro asked about their expectations of Hong Kong, according to a transcript published in Mr. Cordeiro’s book. Mr. Cordeiro’s stature at Radio Hong Kong skyrocketed when he came back and delivered tapes of the interviews to his boss. He said he was given all of the broadcaster’s pop music slots, which meant three other hosts had to be reassigned.Besides playing records, he hosted live music shows like “Lucky Dip,” on which local singers took audience requests. They mostly sang covers of Western hits, which had more cachet in Hong Kong in those days, but some of his guests — notably Roman Tam and Sam Hui — went on to become major Cantopop stars.In 1970, Mr. Cordeiro began “All the Way With Ray,” which he would host for more than half a century. He took requests; knowing that some callers saw his show as a chance to practice conversational English, Mr. Cordeiro often helped them with their pronunciation.Sometimes, so many people called in that the lines crossed and listeners found themselves talking to each other, said Dennis Chan, a longtime fan. He said he and some of the people he met that way struck up friendships.As the years went by, Mr. Cordeiro accommodated listeners’ requests for more contemporary music. But late in life he shifted the emphasis back to the older music he preferred. He would always start his show with Elvis Presley, and as midnight neared, he would move further back in time, to the likes of Steve Lawrence and Doris Day.“He wouldn’t take too much time to describe the songs or their stories. Instead, he would let the audience listen to the music,” said Mr. Chow, his manager. Mr. Cordeiro had open-heart surgery in 2010, but he returned to the airwaves and kept up a five-nights-a-week schedule, from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., until he retired in 2021. In his book, he said he had the best job in the world.“No matter how bad I feel,” he wrote, “once I walk into the studio, I’m full of energy — and ready to go.”Mr. Cordeiro never married and had no children, and he outlived his five siblings.Mr. Chan, a 67-year-old retiree, said he had listened to Mr. Cordeiro since he was 12. He said Mr. Cordeiro knew his voice and would greet him by name when he called.“I would tune in to the program after long days at work, and feel like my good friend was still with me,” he said.";2023-02-02;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/obituaries/ray-cordeiro-dead.html;2023-02-02;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESRAYCORDEIRO,AVOICEONHONGKONG’SAIRWAVESFOR70YEARS,DIESAT98
The New York Times;Lauren Daigle, a Christian Music Superstar, Is Ready for a Bigger Tent;The 31-year-old singer and songwriter is releasing a self-titled album on a major label — and bracing for the potential backlash.;“I’m terrified,” Lauren Daigle said with a broad smile rather than any evident terror. It was six weeks before the release of her new self-titled album, and the biggest singer in contemporary Christian music (CCM) was sitting in a lounge at the midtown Manhattan offices of Atlantic Records, glowing with positivity.Daigle, a vivacious 31-year old with a whimsical streak that’s evident in her colorful wardrobe, has crossed over into the pop world with greater success than anyone since Amy Grant in the early ’90s. But this is the first time she’s written love songs that aren’t about religious faith, and she’s worried that people will hear them as references to her personal life, rather than ruminations about universal experiences.“I’m all about writing songs to help people through things they’re questioning,” she said.“Lauren Daigle,” due May 12, will also be her debut on a major label, after releasing three albums on Centricity Music, a Nashville indie, and it will likely propel her further into the public eye. Later this year, she’ll headline her first arena tour.The United States has become a much more divided and combustible country since Grant’s heyday, and Daigle is no newcomer to navigating the lion’s den. She has been caustically criticized within the Christian community for some of her choices, especially for appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” hosted by a lesbian celebrity, in 2018. All performers are carefully scrutinized in the social media age, but CCM artists live under a unique microscope, and much of the audience is unforgiving.“I can’t imagine the stress artists are under now,” said Brandon Woolum, the managing editor of the long-running publication CCM Magazine. “They have to make sure they don’t say that wrong thing that gets them canceled.” Any article his site runs about Daigle or Grant draws complaints from readers, Woolum added. “People are still mad at Amy.”Even in the past, some Christian artists, notably Grant and the stars Sandi Patty and Michael English, have been repudiated by fans for having affairs or getting divorced. English later denounced the Christian music industry as “a sick world.” Is Daigle worried that one mistake could damage her career in CCM?“Yes, one million-trillion percent,” she said. “For a long time, I lived my life confined, to make sure people think highly of me, and it made me miserable.” Her new mission is to remain unrestrained.Daigle grew up amid the brackish wetlands of Lafayette, La., counting alligators on the drive over to visit her grandparents, and for her new album, she wanted to redirect her music away from light, acoustic soft-rock toward a more soulful, Southern sound. She recorded the album, and another that will follow in the late summer, with the producer Mike Elizondo, whose credits include Fiona Apple and Carrie Underwood, as well as Eminem and 50 Cent.She wrote some songs with Shane McAnally, a Nashville hitmaker who is gay. And because the themes on her album are less faith-based than in the past, she knows some will count what’s referred to in the CCM world as JPMs (mentions of Jesus Per Minute) and find the music too worldly.“I’ve seen people ask, ‘Is Lauren Daigle even a Christian anymore?,’” she said. “At this point, it’s to be expected, so it doesn’t bother me.”In a radio interview after the DeGeneres fracas, Daigle summed up her view of Scripture. Anyone who expected her to shun gay people had “completely missed the heart of God,” she said. “Be who Christ was to everyone as well.” This brought more opprobrium, including a Christian Post column that scoffed, “Lauren, dear sister in Christ, you failed this test.”Does Daigle, who identifies as nondenominational, feel that Christ’s messages have been widely corrupted? “Oh, absolutely. I have seen people use what He said to promote an agenda and keep people controlled. You have a lot of power if you’re telling someone their eternal destiny.”Grant, a friend, praised Daigle’s “lovely” voice, adding that “the dynamics of her own life give her a deep compassion for other people.” As for the criticisms Daigle has faced, “My response is, God is good, people are a mess — all of us.”Image“Dealing with post-Covid symptoms paired with the animosity that plagued our nation brought me to one of the lowest points of my life,” Daigle said. “I had to do a deep dive on who I was.”Credit...Olivia Crumm for The New York TimesChristian rock began in the late 1960s and early ’70s, when it was known as “Jesus Music,” a grass-roots movement led by longhaired hippie outsiders. It gradually built its own infrastructure of record stores, media, festivals and radio stations. Major labels took notice, and began to buy up Christian labels or start imprints of their own.The first schism came over the Amy Grant generation of crossover artists who played songs that could be interpreted as devout or romantic, a middle ground known derisively in some CCM circles as the “Jesus is my boyfriend” or the “God or a girl” phenomenon. But Daigle’s crossover, close observers say, was different.“Lauren represented a new type of stardom on unapologetically confessional terms,” said Joshua Kalin Busman, an assistant professor of music history at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. “She left no ambiguity in her music and spoke transparently about her personal relationship to God.”As a child, Daigle dismissed Christian music as cheesy. She was raised in a religious home that welcomed secular music, as long as there “weren’t F-bombs every five seconds,” she said. She got in trouble a lot at school, for cheating or talking too much. She believes she has ADHD, and also mentions “some OCD” and a few episodes of depression.As her interest in music grew, she cleaned her church choir director’s bathroom in exchange for singing lessons. But she also became ill, with symptoms that included extreme fatigue, jaundice and worsening vision. She eventually learned she had cytomegalovirus, a chronic illness, and began home-schooling using a syllabus and a set of VHS tapes as her guide: “That was the season that changed the trajectory of my life.”She started reading the Bible and had visions of herself as a music star. “I could literally see stages and tour buses. I said, ‘God, are you showing me this, or am I losing my mind?’ I think it was God, because everything I saw has come to pass.”In 2010 and 2012, she was an untelevised contestant on “American Idol.” She also enrolled at Louisiana State University and sang background vocals with the Assemblie, a U2-ish Christian rock group in Baton Rouge, which drew the attention of Centricity Music.Her first single, “How Can It Be,” hit No. 5 on Billboard’s Christian singles chart, the first of 14 songs that have breached its Top 10, including five No. 1s, a record for a female singer. “You Say,” from 2018, spent 129 weeks as the most popular Christian song, and reached Number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has a brooding, almost gothic quality, and showcases her flexible alto, which is full of range and power and often draws comparisons to Adele.“You Say” was still ruling the Christian chart when the pandemic began. As with her first outbreak of cytomegalovirus symptoms, isolation and illness proved transformative.In November 2020, Daigle appeared at a New Orleans worship event organized by Sean Feucht, a provocateur who used “religious freedom” as an excuse to challenge lockdown regulations, and she faced harsh backlash. As with the DeGeneres flap two years earlier, Daigle cried for days, she told me.A year later, Daigle contracted the coronavirus and had migraines for months. Her post-Covid symptoms were worse. She used to go skydiving and cliff jumping, but now she suffered panic attacks, anxiety and bouts of paranoia. She started counseling, and simultaneously wrestled with the question of why so many white Evangelicals supported Donald Trump, and the attendant divisiveness in the country.“Dealing with post-Covid symptoms paired with the animosity that plagued our nation brought me to one of the lowest points of my life,” she said. “I had to do a deep dive on who I was.”Eventually, Daigle began to feel divine love present in the care showed by people close to her, and she wrote “Thank God I Do,” a bruised ballad that’s one of the highlights of her self-titled album.Her two health crises strengthened her “tenacity and resilience,” she said. Criticism and rejection reinforced her resolve to follow a personal understanding of Scripture, rather than that of a church or minister, a practice that goes back hundreds of years, to the founding of Protestantism.“It’s not to say that criticism and animosity doesn’t hurt,” she concluded, “but I do have that confidence piece that will always get me back up on my feet.”;2023-05-02;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/arts/music/lauren-daigle.html;2023-05-03;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESLAURENDAIGLE,ACHRISTIANMUSICSUPERSTAR,ISREADYFORABIGGERTENT
The New York Times;At 81, Ann-Margret Is Finally Living Her Rock ’n’ Roll Dream;The actress and musician, who first burst out in “Bye Bye Birdie” in 1963, is releasing a new album of old rock covers featuring guests like her “Tommy” co-star Pete Townshend.;"Ann-Margret has always spoken in a voice that falls somewhere between a purr and a coo. But at her home on a recent rainy day in Los Angeles, she broke up her usual gauzy tones with deep and gutsy growls. “One, two, three o’clock rock!!!” she half-bellowed and half-yelled over a video chat, echoing the opening line from “Rock Around the Clock,” Bill Haley’s raucous 1954 smash.A few minutes later, she snarled through the opening salvo of “Splish Splash,” the highly caffeinated 1958 hit by Bobby Darin, only to follow it with the outburst, “I love rock ’n’ roll!” Her tone was far more Joan Jett than Kim McAfee, the sprightly character she played in “Bye Bye Birdie,” the movie that simultaneously made her a household name and the hottest pinup of 1963.Ann-Margret — pronounced as one name, not two — has always been rock ’n’ roll adjacent, though that’s rarely talked about today given her long and varied career as an actress and a singer of lounge classics. She co-starred with Elvis Presley in one of his most beloved films, “Viva Las Vegas,” provided a flirty foil to a character meant to affectionately send him up in “Birdie,” and had a personal relationship with him of varying description.ImageAnn-Margret and Elvis Presley on the set of “Viva Las Vegas.” “We looked at one another and all of a sudden, I would do a pose and he’d be doing the same pose. We connected that way,” she said.Credit...Silver Screen Collection, via Getty ImagesShe also commanded a lead singing role in Ken Russell’s gaudy movie version of the Who’s rock opera “Tommy,” and earned a Grammy nomination for best new artist in 1962 after scoring a Top 20 hit with “I Just Don’t Understand,” one of the first recordings to feature a fuzz-toned guitar. Her song inspired a Beatles cover on the BBC two years later and, in 2014, the band Spoon recorded a version of her take, not the Fab Four’s.Yet, it’s only now, at the improbable age of 81, that Ann-Margret is getting the chance to assert herself as a full-on rock ’n’ roll goddess — if a winking one. On Friday she will release “Born to Be Wild,” the first album in the star’s career of 60-plus years to focus squarely on rock standards, all of which she handpicked, including Steppenwolf’s biker anthem referenced in the title and “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,” which Elvis famously gyrated through in his own version.A host of legit rockers leaped at the chance to support her in this lark of a project, including the “Tommy” creator Pete Townshend, who sang and played whiplash guitar on her version of the Everly Brothers’ “Bye-Bye Love”; Steve Cropper, who added Memphis cred to “Son of a Preacher Man”; and Joe Perry, who shot stinging solos into her take on “Rock Around the Clock.” The album also features cameos from peers like Cliff Richard (82) and Pat Boone (88).“What she has done is extraordinary,” Townshend said by phone from London, adding an expletive for emphasis. “She picked up the silver thread that links her to the very genesis of rock ’n’ roll history. There’s a mischievousness to that, a light touch that’s perhaps necessary but also real.”Townshend compared receiving the invitation to play on her album to the time, in 1993, when he “was summoned to play with the Ramones. You know you won’t say no,” he added.Image“I feel the way I felt when I was 10 years old whenever the music plays,” Ann-Margret said.Credit...Chantal Anderson for The New York TimesFrom the dining room of the Benedict Canyon home she has lived in since 1968, Ann-Margaret said she’d long harbored hopes of making a record like “Born to Be Wild.” “Deep inside I’ve wanted to do this kind of album forever,” she explained. She alluded to her outfit — a black sweater, tight leggings and leather boots that rose past the knee: “This is what I’ve been wearing since I first came to Los Angeles,” she said. “This is what I’m comfortable in.”She’s just as comfortable with language that dates from the ’50s, peppering her speech with words like “gadzooks” and “egad.” Looking youthful with her trademark auburn sweep of hair, Ann-Margret has also retained the coquettish character that first made her a star, giggling often when she speaks and never giving away more than she wants to. It was her original image, more than her music, that inspired Brian Perera, the head of Cleopatra Records, which specializes in projects of a historical nature, to propose the album to her.“When you look at vintage photos of her, she’s wearing a leather jacket and riding a motorcycle, so the thought of her doing a rock ’n’ roll record really fit,” he said in an interview.The “Born to Be Wild” album cover drives that home. It reproduces a 1967 poster created for her first Vegas show that finds her in a form-fitting jumpsuit while straddling a Triumph Tiger motorcycle. “I don’t think I can get into that jumpsuit today,” she said, and laughed. “But I can sure try!”ImageAnn-Margret has always been rock ’n’ roll adjacent, though that’s rarely talked about today given her long and varied career as an actress and as a singer of lounge classics. Credit...Bettmann, via Getty ImagesAnn-Margret has always been hot for motorcycles. Her father and uncle rode them when she was a child in Sweden, and when she saw Marlon Brando straddle one in “The Wild One,” “that was it. I had to have one,” she said. “I didn’t know many women who rode bikes back then.”She still rides a Harley specially designed for her in lavender. It makes a perfect complement to her Cadillac, finished in her favorite shade: “Hot pink!” she exclaimed.It could be a twin to Elvis’s famously pink Caddy. The relationship between Ann-Margret and E.P., as she calls him, has been the subject of gossip for decades, but she still won’t speak about the personal aspects of it — only their creative link. “We looked at one another and all of a sudden, I would do a pose and he’d be doing the same pose. We connected that way,” she said.Her record company tried to stress the connection by having her record “Heartbreak Hotel,” but she never had much of a career as a hitmaker. It was her acting in “Carnal Knowledge” — praised in a New York Times review from 1971 — that convinced Townshend that she could really deliver in “Tommy.” While he called the major male actors in the 1975 film — Jack Nicholson and Oliver Reed — “egomaniacal, whiskey drinking lunatics,” he said that Ann-Margret was a consummate professional. She even carried off the absurdity of playing Roger Daltrey’s mother though she was just two years his senior.Image“I’m just happy to be alive,” Ann-Margret said. “I have the same friends I’ve had for 60 years, and I feel the way I felt when I first met them.”Credit...Chantal Anderson for The New York TimesOne of Ann-Margret’s most famous moments in “Tommy” involved geysers of baked beans being shot directly at her. “They came down a chute and then — pow! — it threw me about five feet back!” she said. “And it smelled!” She recalled that Russell said her character was meant to be experiencing a nervous breakdown during the scene, but to some viewers it looked more like she was having an orgasm. “That’s fine with me!” she added brightly.Townshend thinks the director, Russell, took a bit too much pleasure in having her do the scene repeatedly. “Ken loved to have a beautiful woman in his clutches covered in beans,” he said. “Let’s just do it again!”For the new album, he believes Ann-Margret made a perfect choice in having him perform with her on the Everly Brothers song. “My acoustic guitar style is loosely based on Don Everly’s,” he said.Pat Boone, who played Ann-Margret’s love interest in the 1963 musical “State Fair,” was at first taken aback by the song she chose for their duet, “Teach Me Tonight,” which he called “a love scene in a song.” “I thought, ‘What am I doing singing this?’” Boone said. “I’m 87 at that point and she’s got to be 80. I had to do it humorously.”So he ad-libbed the lines “I think we just wrote an octogenarian love song” and “I’ll have to turn up my hearing aid.” For the record, “I don’t wear hearing aids,” Boone added with a laugh.More saucy wit appears in a song Ann-Margret chose from her Vegas act, “Somebody’s in My Orchard,” which includes lines like “Somebody digs my fig trees/Somebody loves their juice.” “Oh, to see people’s faces when they finally realize what I’m singing about,” she said mischievously.Despite all the album’s humor, Paul Shaffer, who played piano on “The Great Pretender,” insists that her Vegas-style approach to music isn’t just camp. “She delivers the goods,” he said.When comparing her with young female entertainers like Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato, he added, “Aren’t they really doing Ann-Margret’s act?”ImageCredit...Chantal Anderson for The New York TimesLike all of the album’s guests, Shaffer recorded his parts separately from the star. He noted that her voice on the recording is lower and huskier than when she last cut an album, a gospel work reflecting her faith that was released 10 years ago. But Perera of Cleopatra Records believes Ann-Margret’s chestier tone works for the grinding sound of early rock. He added that “there isn’t a lot of new music coming from artists whose careers started in the ’50s and early ’60s. That makes it special.”The musicians who appear beside Ann-Margret on the album marveled over her ability, at 81, to convey a come-hither sexuality in her singing. To her, it makes an important point — that eroticism doesn’t have a cutoff date. At the same time, she made sure to deliver her sensuality with humor, and kept the tone of the music light.The only time she turned sad in our talk was when mentioning her husband, the actor Roger Smith, who served as her manager for much of their 50-year relationship and who died in 2017. Last year, she also lost her old friend and “Bye Bye Birdie” co-star Bobby Rydell, who died before he could finish a track he started for the album. Small wonder, when asked about how she feels about her upcoming 82nd birthday, she said, “I’m just happy to be alive. I have the same friends I’ve had for 60 years, and I feel the way I felt when I first met them.”Singing has the same effect: “I feel the way I felt when I was 10 years old whenever the music plays.”";2023-04-06;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/arts/music/ann-margret-born-to-be-wild.html;2023-04-09;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESAT81,ANN-MARGRETISFINALLYLIVINGHERROCK’N’ROLLDREAM
The New York Times;Sean Paul Is Still Busy;For more than 20 years he’s taught generations to let loose on the dance floor. He’s not stopping anytime soon.;"The song is a giddy exaltation of oscillating hips in full swing, of beautiful backsides and the beautiful forms they belong to as they get jiggy, get crunked up, percolate. It is a knight’s declaration of courtly love to his five fair ladies: Jodi, Rebecca, Annabella, the Misses Donna and Cana. It is a lover’s sincere exhortation to his beloveds to shake that thing, made with a sly exuberance that is both worshipful and raunchy.This is the seminal dancehall classic “Get Busy,” a 21-year-old party anthem that has been the source of dance-floor awakenings for generations of horny teenagers and young adults. And the knight paying homage to the things he is so respectfully asking the ladies to shake is Sean Paul, arguably Jamaica’s most famous musical export to the United States since Bob Marley. Two decades ago, after dethroning 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” from its No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, “Get Busy” did for Sean Paul what “Taxi Driver” did for Paul Schrader and “Liebesträume No. 3” did for Franz Liszt. This was the work that made an instant legend of its creator, who until then had been only a moderately successful purveyor of dancehall, Jamaica’s musical successor to reggae.Young people today seem to be discovering Sean Paul with the same delight their elders once did in middle school. On TikTok, the barometer of all contemporary youth relevance, influencers like Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae, who were un- or barely born in 2003, can be found participating in viral dance challenges to “Get Busy,” while millennial comedians 10 years their senior make videos about the unfairness of being in seventh grade when the song was ruling clubs. Like low-rise jeans, going-out tops and the “Fast & Furious” franchise, Sean Paul is one of those ubiquitous elements of Y2K-era American life that is experiencing a thundering resurgence.ImagePaul performing at “MTV Spring Break” in Miami Beach in 2003.Credit...Scott Gries/Getty ImagesImageSting and Paul onstage at the Grammy Awards in 2004. Paul’s “Dutty Rock” won the award for best reggae album.Credit...Frank Micelotta/Getty ImagesI sat down with Paul on a salubrious June afternoon — “salubrious” was his choice of word — on Hellshire Beach near Kingston, where sargassum clogs the shoreline and clusters of shacks jostle for limited space on the ever-shrinking sands. At one of these establishments (either Screechy’s or Screechie’s, depending on whether you believe the indoor spelling or the outdoor one), covers were removed from platters of fried red snapper as Paul, wearing bright-orange cargo shorts and a T-shirt emblazoned with the word “DUTTY,” unrolled his smoking paraphernalia. He was by turns sprightly and pensive. The party-boy persona that once made him a megastar has evolved into that of a fun but responsible uncle — the one who still knows how to throw a party but will also ensure that everyone eats well and gets home safely afterward. The night before, for instance, in the courtyard of a studio I was told had been built by Shaggy and his former manager, I watched some of Paul’s associates smoke from a many-feet-long chalice pipe as they waited to begin rehearsals for a coming tour. When Paul drove up, he announced that he had brought a case of mangoes from his own orchard, and I was treated to the wholesome tableau of a group of grown men tearing into a cardboard box, each extracting a mango and biting in with sighs and groans of unadulterated relish. The rehearsal featured breaks to crack open bottles of industrial-strength white rum — and loud shouts of laughter, including at my saying I shouldn’t drink while working and at my frozen expression when I did finally try a sip. This jovial gathering of dad bods, dad shorts and dad jokes more resembled the vibe of an after-school band rehearsal than a multiplatinum recording artist preparing to play a sold-out arena — perhaps because some of these guys really have known Paul since his earliest days in music.As Paul explained to me at Screechy/ie’s, for his life to become what it is now — that of a Grammy-winning artist with YouTube views in the multiple billions and a catalog of beloved classics — a series of extremely fortunate events had to occur. And a fair number of them, he didn’t have much say in. Long before he became the bandannaed and cornrowed Sean Paul who entranced the American public, Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques was just another young offshoot of Jamaica’s famous Henriques clan, one of the oldest Jewish families on the island, who immigrated there from Portugal in the 17th century. Paul, who has British and Chinese heritage on his mother’s side, actually grew up Catholic in solidly respectable Uptown Kingston, watching the raucous parties thrown at his grandmother’s home by an enterprising aunt who ran a sound system. Kingston is a city that takes parties seriously, and the sound system was a key 20th-century innovation — a portable setup of amplifiers, turntables and mountains of speakers, all orchestrated by a D.J. and an M.C., who truck the equipment to makeshift venues and use its booming sound to draw crowds. Paul and his younger brother, Jason, were both enamored of this family business; Jason actually recalls falling asleep in a bass box as a child. It was both brothers’ earliest immersion in music, listening to the Uptown crowds dance to Michael Jackson beats blended with the dancehall and reggae rhythms of Kingston. Despite the legacy Paul was born into, his childhood was shaped by absences — like that of his father, Garth, who would disappear for months at a time, leaving his wife, Frances, hunting door to door, asking neighbors if they had seen him. He would materialize, months later, perhaps having whiled away the time in Mexico, once having crashed a Cherokee 6 plane stuffed full of marijuana in the Everglades. When Paul was 13, his father was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison. This devastated Paul — not because his father had been much of a presence in his life but because what little he had of him would now be gone. It felt, he says, like “that’s forever — Oh, I’ll never see this dude again.”ImagePaul with his father, Garth Henriques, at the National Stadium swimming pool in Kingston.Credit...via Sean PaulHis mother sent him to Wolmer’s Boys’ School, among the oldest in Jamaica. Paul, who until then had been a bit of a dreamer, was thrust into a teenage milieu far removed from his former Jewish prep school; he began getting in fights with kids who teased him about his father being in prison. He was saved from a descent into hooliganism by swimming, a sport for which the Henriques family is well known. Both of Paul’s parents were champion swimmers, and he carried on that legacy, representing Jamaica at international competitions and as a water-polo player, his days beginning at 5:30 a.m. and spent training furiously.Still, his grades weren’t good enough to get him into college, which was beyond his mother’s means anyway. He enrolled in a program for hotel management and learned the basics of French cuisine (yes, Sean Paul of “Temperature” fame knows how to make hollandaise); for a time he worked as a bank teller while making demo tapes in private. He would freestyle with a group called the Dutty Cup Crew, and there was a time when his father, newly released from prison, tried to introduce him to people in the music industry. But watching Sean — thoughtful, introspective Sean — pursue a career as an M.C. and dancehall toaster still seemed outlandish to those around him. He recalls a well-intentioned friend getting drunk at a party and crying while asking him why he was throwing his life away.ImagePaul in 1992.

The young Sean Paul was intensely affected by the differences he saw in the quality of life between Uptown and Downtown Kingston. The early songs he wrote were of a subgenre classified as conscious reggae — socially minded stuff, meant to highlight the injustices he saw around him. He didn’t see any trouble with this until a producer took him aside and told him flat out: No one wanted to listen to conscious songs from a light-skinned Uptown kid. He might have had a father in prison for manslaughter and a mother who, he says, did tie-dye to support the family, and he might have grown up occasionally eating callaloo picked from the backyard, but on paper he was a posh boy with a surname and family legacy that made it impossible for him to be taken seriously while singing about wealth inequality. Crestfallen but persuaded, Paul pivoted, channeling his sensitivities into the topics producers wanted him to sing about: parties, women and weed. One result was “Baby Girl,” a stripped-down track in which Paul entreats a woman to dry her eyes, leave her no-good man and come to him — a man who will “love yuh fi yuh body, but more fi yuh brain.” To him, Paul says, this was still a conscious song: “In dancehall, you always sing big of the ladies, how good they look or about wanting to get with them. But you never sing about: ‘I hear you in trouble? You’re in a relationship where you’re being abused? I’ll be there for you.’ That’s what the song was about.”In dancehall, masculinity is often a kind of balloon animal the M.C. inflates and twists into aggrandized shapes. In her book “Dancehall: Origins, History, Future,” the professor Donna P. Hope identifies the “six G’s” lyrics tend to dwell on (gun, gyal, ghetto, gays, ganja, God) and how each can be used to underline the vocalist’s machismo. The genre had made inroads into the U.S. market before — from Super Cat, Shabba Ranks, Beenie Man, Ini Kamoze — but if Paul would one day top them all, perhaps it’s because even at the peak of his party-boy persona, he understood that longing for things you cannot have is a universal sentiment. He has spent his entire career writing soft-focus love songs and ballads of unrequited yearning; they’re just disguised as songs to grind pelvises to. “Temperature” promises to “shelter you from the storm.” “Rockabye” is an earnest tribute to single mothers. On “Give It Up to Me,” he promises “love so clear/It gonna make you shine, and once you are mine/We be rockin it until the end of time.” These are club tracks, but if you, just hypothetically, happened to be listening to them on repeat during your fifth hour of silently hiccup-sobbing into a pillow (don’t ask), they would absolutely deliver in that arena as well.“Baby Girl” was Paul’s first local radio hit, earning him some popularity in Jamaica and paving the way for his first U.S. studio album. But it was his sophomore LP, “Dutty Rock,” that made Sean Paul into the commercial leviathan he is today. In 2002, a brief New York Times article noted an interesting new record featuring 19 songs, by different artists, all built on the same bewitching “riddim,” a basic beat for dancehall artists to record over. Created by a producer named Steven (Lenky) Marsden, the Diwali riddim — named after the Hindu festival — was built on frenetic syncopated hand claps that escalate over an underlying boom. At the time, Marsden had no sense of the classic he had created. But if you were alive in the early 2000s, you simply could not escape the contagious sound of this percussive loop, which would bounce and undulate its way through the culture everywhere, from Lumidee’s charmingly off-key hit “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)” to Wayne Wonder’s “No Letting Go.” ImagePaul in Norbrook, an upscale neighborhood in Kingston, in July. A younger Paul had wanted to sing about wealth inequality, until a producer told him that no one wanted those songs from an uptown kid like him. Credit...Naila Ruechel for The New York TimesMarsden received a phone call from VP Records asking if he would lend the riddim to one of their buzzy new artists: Sean Paul. The result was “Get Busy,” a monstrous hit that transformed Paul’s career and helped sell nearly six million copies of “Dutty Rock.” Back in the clubs-cars-and-Cristal era of R.&B., the “Get Busy” music video was an anomaly, too, depicting a party that would be recognizable to suburban diasporas everywhere: adults gathered around a dining table, young people crowding the unfinished basement below, an angry Caribbean dad in a loud batik-print shirt yelling at the youths to “stop banging on the damn furnace.”Paul is now closer to the age of that video dad than the basement party-starter he played. In the intervening years, he has remained booked and busy, ushering in a steady procession of hit songs, both his own and in collaborations with other pop stars. Whether you have recognized it or not, a new song of his has likely made its way to you in the past eight years — perhaps by way of “No Lie,” his collaboration with a sandpaper-voiced, prefame Dua Lipa; his work with the actor Idris Elba on the rambunctious “Boasty”; or his guest feature on Sia’s “Cheap Thrills,” which seemed to blare constantly from the stock-exchange-size H&M in Times Square in the summer of 2017. Paul may now be an elder statesman of dancehall, but he is still producing, recording and performing with vigor. As for the Jodi in “Get Busy,” she’s now his wife. I am one of those millennials who discovered Sean Paul at age 12 — but I also grew up in a secluded, almost cultlike boarding school in India, where we were forbidden any sort of internet access and had little idea what was popular among people our age in the outside world. My only familiarity with reggae was by way of an English guy named Steven Kapur who grew dreadlocks, called himself Apache Indian and sang in a Punjabi-inflected patois about wanting an arranged marriage with a dainty Indian girl who would make him rotis. I did recognize the Diwali riddim, but only because the Lumidee hit based on it would play when Megan Fox’s character appeared onscreen in the Lindsay Lohan classic “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.” Still: Somehow, by way of some entrepreneurial soul who knew how to burn pirated music onto CDs, “Get Busy” would play on repeat at my all-girls school’s gatherings with boys from a neighboring school, where chaperones were stationed at every corner to prevent anyone from getting even remotely busy. Whether it’s at a grimy nightclub or in an auditorium full of emotionally stunted teenagers avoiding eye contact in Dehradun, India, there are a few things likely to occur whenever a D.J. puts on “Get Busy” for a crowd of the right age. There will be squeals of recognition as Paul booms “SHAKE … THAT … THING,” each word with its vertiginous pause. Then the delirious, almost incantatory hand claps will start to register: “It’s the ignition of those butterflies,” he told me. As Paul’s exuberant melodies combine with the boisterous throb of the Diwali riddim, listeners’ hips and waists acquire a sentience of their own, moving as if threatening to secede from the rest of the body.This was true in 2003 — some 40-year-olds I asked wistfully confirmed this for me — and it remains true two decades later. I watched Paul live in concert, not once but twice, last year in New York. He was a consummate showman, with unflagging reserves of energy, leaping around in front of the giant Jamaican flag draped over the D.J. console overseen by his brother. Paul seemed to know exactly who his audience was, and to this audience he gave exactly what we wanted: his biggest hits, opening immediately with the iconic intro of “Get Busy,” to which we all lost our minds. On both occasions, I witnessed elder millennials try hip movements far beyond our joints’ collagen levels. Each time I felt as though I had been factory reset as a person.ImagePaul at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2022.Credit...Charles Sykes/Invision, via Associated PressThe members of Paul’s preteen fandom — whether that means me in 2003 or the kids browsing TikTok a year ago — might not have had any frame of reference for the parties and spliffs that he was singing about, the Jamaican patois he was singing in or his place in the lineage of dancehall. But a thumping party track is a thumping party track, and not knowing the lyrics would not stop any of us from, as one recent video elegantly put it, “throwing ass” to his bangers, then or now. For decades, Paul has offered the service so much great pop does: distilling a mythical idea of the perfect party, the always-pumping club, and delivering it into the minds and ears of people who will not learn for years that real clubgoing tends to be much more tedious and involve uncomfortable shoes. For someone like me — someone who, until I moved away from home, wasn’t even allowed to go to parties, let alone parties with sexually suggestive dancing — Paul’s songs were about the poetry and promise of dark, sweaty basements and libidinous gyrations. Neither was part of my life at 12, and neither are part of it as a not-so-young-anymore adult with an office job. But Paul’s best songs take all your amorphous longings and feelings of exile — whether imposed by a pandemic or a boarding school or a lost youth — and exorcise them.I can’t wait for the weekend, I can’t want to see that girl again: That, Paul told me in Kingston, is the type of anticipation he puts into his songs. Because if there is one thing he has understood since he was 14, it is the stultifying restlessness that lurks beneath the lives of suburban teenagers. Today he considers it his artistic purpose to exalt uncomplicated ease and pleasure. His legacy is the pure euphoria that erupts on faces when he performs “Get Busy.” The fact that he has been doing this for more than 20 years struck him, recently, when he realized that the nieces and nephews who were infants when the song took off are now old enough to drink and party and experience their uncle’s concerts. “And then they start going to the shows,” he giggled, “and they’re like, Yo?!” At 22, he said, he had wanted to sing about social evils. At 50, he has found peace simply taking people’s minds off them.Iva Dixit is a staff editor at the magazine, where her past articles have included an ode to the delights of eating raw onions and an exploration of the popularity of the TV show “Emily in Paris.” This is her first feature for the magazine.

The New York Times;Lily Allen’s Second Act;The British singer, now sober, has a new life in New York, and a new string to her bow: acting.;Lily Allen didn’t know why she agreed to be interviewed for this article.On a recent morning, sitting outside a London cafe, the British singer said she had paused earlier for a moment of reflection. “I was like, ‘Why am I doing this?’” she said. “I sort of wonder why I put myself in these situations, and open myself up to criticism.”Allen, 38, hypothesized that the answer might be narcissism, or her resignation to the requirements of being in the public eye. “It’s been my life since I was like 18 years old,” she said.Since Allen burst onto the pop music scene in the mid-00s with lilting reggae-infused tracks like “Smile,” her relationship with the press has been fraught. She has always been outspoken — in her lyrics, in interviews and on social media — and for many years, she was a fixture in Britain’s tabloid newspapers. In 2009, she obtained a court order to stop paparazzi following her around London.“It’s not a very nice feeling,” she said of that kind of attention. “Especially when you’re in your early 20s, and you’re still trying to figure out who you are in the world.”Now, Allen lives in New York, where she largely goes unrecognized. She was back in London because she has also left music behind — at least for now — and turned her attention to acting, instead.Allen is currently playing a lead role in a West End revival of “The Pillowman,” the 2003 play by the “Banshees of Inisherin” writer and director Martin McDonagh, which runs at The Duke of York’s Theater through Sept. 2.“I still get to play with the human experience,” she said of this career transition, “but I don’t have to put my heart on my sleeve as much” as in her — often very personal — songs.ImagePaul Kaye and Lily Allen in “The Pillowman,” at Duke of York’s Theater in London.Credit...Johan PerssonAllen’s mother is a film producer and her father an actor, but as a teenager she was drawn to music. When she was 19, in 2005, she signed to the Regal/Parlaphone label and built a following on the then-nascent social media site MySpace. According to Michael Cragg, who recently wrote a book on British pop music, the music scene at the time “was kind of mired in ‘The X Factor’ and TV talent shows.” The consensus, he added, “was that pop needed a bit of a kick up the bum.”Clad in prom-style dresses, chunky gold jewelry and sneakers, Allen was a new kind of British pop star. With a London accent, she sang her own funny and provocative lyrics about messy relationships, sex and self-loathing. “A young woman singing and presenting themselves in that way felt very exciting,” Cragg said.Her first two albums — “Alright, Still” and “It’s Not Me, It’s You” — were commercial and critical successes, but the making and marketing of a third, “Sheezus,” in 2014, was more fraught: In interviews, she has described having an “identity crisis” at the time, as she tried to be both a pop star and a new mom.In 2018, Allen’s next release, “No Shame” — a low-key record that addressed her divorce and feelings of isolation — was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but Allen has since become disillusioned with the music industry, she said. “It’s so competitive, it’s so rooted in money and success and digital figures,” she added. “I’m just not interested in doing any of that.”ImageAllen performing in London in 2007. Her prom-style dresses and strong London accent made her stand out among the pop stars at the time.Credit...Suzan Moore/Press Association, via ReutersAt around the same time, she also changed her relationship to alcohol and drugs. “From 18 to about four or five years ago just feels like a bit of a haze, because I was literally just off my face the whole time,” Allen said. “I was using fame as well — that was an addiction in itself: the attention and the paparazzi and the chaos.”Allen’s “four year sober birthday” fell on the date of this interview, she said, and it seemed that chaos had abated. Three years ago, she married the “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour, 48. Her life in New York with him and her two daughters from her previous marriage was “pretty leisurely,” she said.So when she was approached about an acting role in the West End show “2:22 A Ghost Story,” she “was like, ‘No, I don’t act and I live in New York, so no thanks,’” she said. But Harbour convinced her to take the gig, and it earned her a nomination in the Olivier Awards, Britain’s equivalent to the Tony’s.In “The Pillowman,” Allen plays Katurian, a writer living in a totalitarian state, who is questioned about a string of child murders that remind the authorities of her fictional stories. Like much of McDonagh’s work, it’s as dark as it is comic.Allen said she saw a through line between McDonagh’s “dark and sick humor” and the lyrics of the songs she used to write. In rehearsals, she added, “I would say things that people might ordinarily be shocked by, and you look at Martin, and he’d be smiling.”Image“I still get to play with the human experience,” Allen said of her career transition to acting, “but I don’t have to put my heart on my sleeve as much.”Credit...Ellie Smith for The New York TimesAllen’s turn as Katurian is the first time the role has been played by a woman, and her casting gives Katurian’s interrogation scenes, in which she is verbally and physically abused by two detectives, a different weight.“The play really is about patriarchal brutality,” said Matthew Dunster, the production’s director. “I said to Martin, ‘This is going to be really difficult for audiences to take, this slight woman being treated to brutally so early on in the piece,’ and Martin said, ‘Isn’t that the point?’”Dunster also directed Allen in “2:22 A Ghost Story,” and he said he had seen her grow as an actor. “What was thrilling to me was to see her taking ownership of her own process,” he said.When “The Pillowman” ends, Allen intends to return to New York. Her priority would be settling her two daughters into middle school, she said, but she had also applied for acting courses.One day, she said, she hoped to land lead roles in films and television. But, for now, she added, she was leaving herself open “to any opportunities that come my way.”;2023-08-17;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/theater/lily-allen.html;2023-08-20;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESLILYALLEN’SSECONDACT
The New York Times;Chris Bailey, Who Gave Australia Punk Rock, Dies at 65;His band, the Saints, introduced the country (and the world) to their raw sound just as the Sex Pistols were emerging in London and the Ramones in New York.;"Chris Bailey, an Australian singer who with his band, the Saints, introduced their country to the raw, fast-tempo sounds of punk rock in the mid-1970s, just as the Sex Pistols were spiking their hair in London and the Ramones were donning their leather jackets in New York City, died on April 9 in Haarlem, the Netherlands. He was 65.His wife, Elisabet Corlin, confirmed the death, of natural causes, but did not provide details.Mr. Bailey and the Saints did not borrow from the sounds emanating out of Britain and the United States. Rather, in a case of parallel evolution, they emerged simultaneously, shaped in their native Brisbane by some of the same forces at work in the Northern Hemisphere: high unemployment, stifling social conservatism and grungy political radicalism.They released their first hit, “(I’m) Stranded,” in September 1976, two months before the Sex Pistols debuted with “Anarchy in the U.K.” and one month before the Damned released “New Rose,” widely considered Britain’s first punk single.“(I’m) Stranded,” which the Saints produced themselves, is as pure a punk anthem as one can find, with buzz saw guitar and driving rhythms punctuating Mr. Bailey’s fast-paced snarl of a voice, singing about youthful ennui and failed romance.That single shot the Saints to national and then global attention among the underground cognoscenti, even though it caused only the shallowest ripple in the charts. Until then, no label was interested in the stringy-haired foursome from Queensland; suddenly, everyone was.The Saints — with Mr. Bailey on vocals, Ed Kuepper on guitar, Ivor Hay on drums and Kym Bradshaw on bass — signed with EMI and moved to London in 1977, just as punk was hitting its stride.They were a part of the scene there and separate from it, both sonically — they incorporated horns, for one thing — and ideologically: To them, punk, ostensibly a cri de coeur against consumer society, was already a commodified part of it. Mr. Bailey called it a “marketing gimmick.”Unlike the typical pointy-haired British punks, the Saints kept their look low-key, more like a 1990s American grunge band (and, not coincidentally, many a latter-day Seattle band noted the Saints as an inspiration).Nevertheless, they thrived. Their single “This Perfect Day” reached No. 34 on the U.K. charts, and their first two albums, “(I’m) Stranded” (1977) and “Eternally Yours” (1978), are considered punk classics. The second album included “Know Your Product,” an anti-consumer, anti-punk song that sent fans raving.But like punk itself, the Saints had a short shelf life, though by their third album, the R&B-spiked “Prehistoric Sounds,” they were starting to transcend the genre. Released in late 1978, it fizzled, EMI dropped them and a few months later Mr. Kuepper and Mr. Hay left the band.The Saints’ legacy cannot be measured by record sales; they influenced generations of Australian rockers, as well as bands emerging from the early 1980s metal scene along the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, like Guns N’ Roses.Nick Cave, another Australian musician who came up in the punkish underground of the 1970s, said in a memorial statement on the website Red Hand Files, “I can only simply repeat, for the record, that, in my opinion, the Saints were Australia’s greatest band, and that Chris Bailey was my favorite singer.”Christopher James Mannix Bailey was born on Nov. 29, 1956, in Nanyuki, Kenya, where his father, Robert Bailey, was stationed with the British Army. His mother, Bridget (O’Hare) Bailey, was a homemaker.The family returned to the Baileys’ native Belfast, Northern Ireland, when Christopher was young. But with political unrest brewing and Australia opening its doors to immigrants, the family soon moved to Brisbane, where Robert found work as a night watchman in a factory.Along with his wife, Mr. Bailey is survived by his brother, Michael, and his sisters, Mary, Carol and Margaret Bailey and Maureen Schull.ImageMr. Bailey onstage during the 2012 Homebake Music Festival in Sydney.Credit...Don Arnold/WireImageAfter the Saints’ original lineup split up, Mr. Bailey reconstituted the band and recorded a series of albums under the same name and later as a solo act. He moved away from punk toward roots-driven rock, folk and austere instrumentation that showed off his room-filling rich voice.He moved to Sweden in the 1990s, and then to the Netherlands in 1994, where he continued to write and record. Bruce Springsteen covered one of his songs, “Just Like Fire Would,” on his 2014 album “High Hopes.”While the musician Bob Geldof reportedly said that “rock music of the ’70s was changed by three bands: the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and the Saints,” Mr. Bailey was unbothered by the Saints’ name recognition relative to those others.“This is the world in which we live,” he told The Los Angeles Times in 1998. “Bitter and twisted is something I don’t see any advantage in being.”";2022-04-26;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/arts/music/chris-bailey-dead.html;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESCHRISBAILEY,WHOGAVEAUSTRALIAPUNKROCK,DIESAT65
The New York Times;Steve Lacy’s Streaming Smash ‘Bad Habit’ Climbs to No. 1;A left-field hit from a 24-year-old master of alternative R&B displaces Harry Styles’s “As It Was” as the top single, while Bad Bunny logs a 12th week atop the album chart.;Steve Lacy, a 24-year-old guitarist and producer, started the year with a reputation as a gifted innovator on the fringes of alternative R&B, best known for a D.I.Y. approach in the studio. Now he has the No. 1 song in the country.“Bad Habit,” a spacey, pensive ballad driven by a slightly warped guitar, has been a monster streaming hit since its release three months ago. After gaining traction on pop radio it finally climbs to the top spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart this week, with 20 million streams and 40 million “airplay audience impressions,” a measurement of a song’s popularity on radio stations, according to the tracking service Luminate.The song, from Lacy’s second studio album, “Gemini Rights,” replaces Harry Styles’s “As It Was” at the top of the chart, after an on-and-off reign of 15 weeks since April.The ascent of “Bad Habit” has been one of the more surprising stories in the music business this year, but for those watching Lacy’s career it has not come out of nowhere. After emerging as a teenage member of the Internet, an offshoot from Odd Future — the boundary-pushing hip-hop ensemble that gave us Frank Ocean, Syd, Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator — Lacy collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, Solange, Vampire Weekend and others, developing a track record as an artist who could comfortably bridge R&B, hip-hop and alternative rock.How long “Bad Habit” will hold, however, is an open question — “Unholy,” the latest from the British singer Sam Smith featuring Kim Petras, is hot on its heels.The Billboard 200 album chart is once again dominated by a familiar face: Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican superstar whose “Un Verano Sin Ti” is the year’s biggest album, with a gigantic stadium tour to match. This week, “Un Verano” is No. 1 for a 12th time.Bad Bunny’s album had the equivalent of 87,000 sales in the United States in its most recent week, including 120 million streams, according to Luminate. As far as No. 1 albums go, that total is modest. So far this year, the albums reaching the top each week have had an average equivalent sales number — a composite figure that incorporates streaming, individual track downloads and old-fashioned purchases of an album as a complete unit — of about 138,000. Even so, the numbers for “Verano” this week are still nearly twice as high as any of its competitors.The Australian pop-rock band 5 Seconds of Summer opens at No. 2 with the equivalent of 48,000 sales of its latest, “5SOS5,” which includes 36,000 copies sold as a complete package and just 16 million streams. (By comparison, in recent weeks Bad Bunny’s “Me Porto Bonito” and “Titi Me Pregunto” — just two of the 23 tracks on “Un Verano” — have each been drawing as many clicks.)Morgan Wallen’s “Dangerous: The Double Album,” a chart mainstay for 21 months and counting, is No. 3. Last week’s top seller, Blackpink’s “Born Pink,” falls to No. 4 with the equivalent of 40,000 sales, a 60 percent drop. Styles’s “Harry’s House” is in fifth place.;2022-10-03;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/arts/music/steve-lacy-bad-habit-billboard-chart.html;2022-10-05;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESSTEVELACY’SSTREAMINGSMASH‘BADHABIT’CLIMBSTONO.1
The New York Times;The Case of the $5,000 Springsteen Tickets;Triumphant fans showed up in Ticketmaster’s queue with special codes, only to encounter its “dynamic pricing” system. Was the Boss OK with that?;"For in-the-know fans who wanted to buy Bruce Springsteen tickets this month, applying for a special Ticketmaster access code seemed the best way to beat long odds. If they got one, they would have an opportunity to try to make it to the front of the service’s virtual queues on the days when batches of shows were up for sale.Only then, however, did countless numbers of them discover that the normally priced tickets they had been hoping to buy were nowhere to be found. Instead, a demand-driven dynamic pricing system had taken hold — with someone, somewhere having decided that remaining seats should cost many times the normal price, up to $5,500 or so.To be clear, no scalpers were selling those tickets. Instead, a new definition of face value had emerged, one that many fans had never encountered. Confusion reigned, and anguished reactions poured forth in Facebook fan groups, into my inbox and onto Twitter.This tweet, from Bill Werde, a former Billboard editorial director who writes a newsletter about the music industry, made my heart hurt: “Hard to believe that Bruce Springsteen turned out to be the one to make music fans miss scalpers.”After days of this sort of commentary, Mr. Springsteen and his camp had heard enough. “In pricing tickets for this tour, we looked carefully at what our peers have been doing,” his manager, Jon Landau, said in a statement. “We chose prices that are lower than some and on par with others.“Regardless of the commentary about a modest number of tickets costing $1,000 or more, our true average ticket price has been in the mid-$200 range,” he continued. “I believe that in today’s environment, that is a fair price to see someone universally regarded as among the very greatest artists of his generation.”Indeed, people did buy nearly all the tickets. On Tuesday morning, 90,000 people were in the queue seeking seats for a show in Philadelphia, according to the event’s promoter. Still, a triumphant return to the stage — Mr. Springsteen has not performed with his band on a big U.S. tour since 2016 — is now another chapter in the decades-long tale of how buying tickets for in-demand events gets more unpleasant over time.Ticketmaster and Mr. Springsteen have some history. In 2009, Ticketmaster tried to nudge his fans into its proprietary, StubHub-like resale system featuring scalperlike prices.That didn’t go over well.“The abuse of our fans and our trust by Ticketmaster has made us as furious as it has made many of you,” Mr. Springsteen said in a statement at the time. The New Jersey attorney general got involved, Ticketmaster settled her investigation, and its chief executive issued a groveling apology.Since then, Ticketmaster, which is handling most of the U.S. shows on Mr. Springsteen’s tour next year, has tried to wear the white hat, at least some of the time. In an interview in May on a podcast called “The Compound & Friends,” Michael Rapino, the chief executive of Ticketmaster’s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, noted that many tickets for the best concerts and other events had a much higher street value the moment Ticketmaster sold them. Why shouldn’t an artist capture most of that excess? Prices that are too low open the door for scalpers to make more money — via the profit they gain from selling at the true market price — than performers make themselves.If artists do want to capture that, Ticketmaster is prepared to help — and to take a fee for doing so. And that’s what Mr. Springsteen seemed to be doing here, using Ticketmaster’s “Official Platinum” system, in which seats are “dynamically priced up and down based on demand.”You already know what happened next: Those platinum prices were plenty pricey. Outrage ensued. A congressman from New Jersey yelled into the wind.“This broke our spirit,” said Pete Maimone, a real estate agent in North Brunswick, N.J., who coordinates a face-value-only ticket exchange for longtime fans. He has shut it down for now, he told me, while fighting back tears. “We did not want to participate any longer in this clear-as-day scheme to extract money from fans,” he said.Over the weekend, in an attempt to quiet things down, Mr. Springsteen’s camp gave Ticketmaster permission to release some numbers. Just 1.3 percent of Ticketmaster users paid more than $1,000 per ticket. Also, 88.2 percent of tickets were “sold at set prices,” according to Ticketmaster, though the remaining 11.8 percent are likely to represent more than 11.8 percent of the revenue per show, owing to their higher face value.Who set these prices? “Promoters and artist representatives set pricing strategy and price range parameters on all tickets, including dynamic and fixed price points,” a Ticketmaster spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “When there are far more people who want to attend an event than there are tickets available, prices go up.”So, as many fans suspected, they are, indeed, the latest guinea pigs in a continuing experiment to try to determine the precise market price of ecstatic experiences for fans of live events.Dynamic pricing isn’t new, though it was new to plenty of Mr. Springsteen’s fans this month.But it’s not as though fans had not considered the core question: At what price comes Mr. Springsteen’s brand of pure, unbridled joy? His shows can last more than three hours, and he mixes up his set lists more than most major touring artists. Also, by the time he and his band hit the stage in 2023, it will have been seven years since they did so on a big U.S. tour.All of that feeds the desire for fans to attend multiple shows, to make sure they don’t miss something rare. And, as a longtime fan, I can say this with exactly zero objectivity and even less scientific precision: His tickets are worth many, many hundreds of dollars.As to exactly how many dollars, Ticketmaster lets artists set high — or low — prices. It will help them boost prices in real time, to leave less money on the table for scalpers. But it operates in that resale market, too, to compete with scalpers on their own turf. Ticketmaster’s gonna Ticketmaster.Mr. Springsteen’s choices here were fraught. As a bard of the people, his silence on the situation became too conspicuous to those very people who fought and scraped to pay a lot of money to be in his presence.Mr. Springsteen could have explained what happened here and also tried to change it. One possibility would have been — and could still be — to tell Ticketmaster not to do variable pricing anymore. Crowded House did that two years ago, claiming that the band hadn’t known that Ticketmaster was going to use it.Placing a cap on how high the variable system is allowed to send ticket prices is another possibility. Maybe it has already happened in the last few days or will in the next few; again, we don’t know. The lower you set the cap, however, the more opportunity there is for scalpers to charge even more on the secondary market. A ban on transferring tickets altogether has promise, but it creates its own logistical, legal and equity challenges.Not long ago, Mr. Werde of the trenchant tweet was in the Ticketmaster queue for Paul McCartney tickets. His 11-year-old son is a big Beatles fan. His turn arrived, he saw the prices just below $300 per ticket, and a kind of desperflation kicked in. What if this was his last chance to get in the arena at that price? The clock was ticking. He took a deep breath and jumped.When he checked back before the show, similar seats were available at 50 to 70 percent less than what he had paid. “I’m a guy who ran Billboard, who runs a music business program at Syracuse, and I got screwed,” he said. “I paid hundreds of dollars that I didn’t need to pay, but because I didn’t have that guarantee, and I wasn’t willing to risk not getting a ticket, I made a mortgage payment to Paul McCartney.”And was it worth it? “Yep.”";2022-07-26;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/your-money/bruce-springsteen-tickets.html;2022-07-28;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESTHECASEOFTHE$5,000SPRINGSTEENTICKETS
The New York Times;‘We Lost Our Miracle Baby,’ Britney Spears Shares;The pop singer, recently released from a conservatorship that had prevented her from becoming pregnant, revealed on Instagram that she has had a miscarriage.;A month after announcing on Instagram that she was pregnant, the pop star Britney Spears has posted an update saying that she suffered a miscarriage, writing: “We have lost our miracle baby.”“Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along,” said the message, which was posted to Ms. Spears’s Instagram account on Saturday afternoon and attributed to her and her partner, Sam Asghari. “However we were overly excited to share the good news.”When Ms. Spears, 40, let it be known that she was pregnant, her announcement was seen by many not only as glad tidings, but also as a declaration of agency after being freed from a conservatorship that had governed her life since she was in her 20s.That arrangement began in 2008, amid concerns over her mental health and potential substance abuse, when a judge in California granted oversight of her personal life and finances to her father, James P. Spears.During court proceedings last summer that stemmed from her request that the conservatorship be dissolved, Ms. Spears testified during a 23-minute speech that the arrangement had been “abusive,” adding that she had not been allowed to remove an IUD.“I want to be able to get married and have a baby,” Ms. Spears said then. “I was told right now in the conservatorship I am not able to get married or have a baby.”The statement about not being allowed to become pregnant was particularly stunning, even in a speech in which Ms. Spears also told the court that she had been placed on Lithium and forced to work against her will.Some reproductive rights advocates said that forced birth control was legally questionable, a violation of Ms. Spears’s autonomy and of her basic human rights.Late last year, a judge in Los Angeles ended the conservatorship, saying it was “no longer required.” By that time Ms. Spears had announced her engagement to her longtime boyfriend, Mr. Asghari, an actor and fitness trainer who told Men’s Health in 2018 that he had met Ms. Spears two years earlier while working on a music video for her song “Slumber Party.”Ms. Spears announced that she was pregnant on April 11, posting a photograph of pink flowers on Instagram and writing: “So I got a pregnancy test … and uhhhhh well … I am having a baby.”She described having experienced depression during a previous pregnancy, and said that this time she would be staying in more and doing yoga each day. She ended her message by writing: “Spreading lots of joy and love,” followed by heart emojis and exclamation points.The message posted on Ms. Spears’s Instagram on Saturday expressed gratitude for fans’ support. “Our love for each other is our strength,” it added. “We will continue trying to expand our beautiful family.”;2022-05-14;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/14/arts/music/britney-spears-miscarriage.html;2022-05-18;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMES‘WELOSTOURMIRACLEBABY,’BRITNEYSPEARSSHARES
The New York Times;What Happens When a Pop Star Isn’t That Popular?;Pop’s middle class enjoys loyal online fan bases. For these artists, pop stardom isn’t a commercial category, but a sound, an aesthetic and an attitude.;"On certain corners of the internet, “The Loveliest Time,” the Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen’s seventh album, could be confused for the biggest album of the year. But the average Top 40 radio listener probably hasn’t heard it. And when the Billboard 200 chart posted the week after its arrival last month, “The Loveliest Time” was nowhere to be found.Jepsen’s very active online fan base is part of the ecosystem known as stan Twitter. A spin through obsessively curated social media “update accounts” like @PopCrave and @chartdata leads to the impression that we’re living through a golden age of pure pop, akin to the period of the 2010s in which Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna reached commercial dominance with songs constructed from monster hooks and pounding synths.Online, conversation constantly bubbles about a set of singers — Kim Petras, Ava Max, Sabrina Carpenter, Bebe Rexha, Rina Sawayama, Rita Ora, Troye Sivan and others — who are debated and adored, often becoming trending topics. To their loyal fans, many of whom are women and queer men (who have always worked hard to valorize underappreciated divas), they are, in the parlance of the internet, pop stars.They are undoubtedly celebrities, with considerable social media followings. They may have tasted a version of popularity — a Hot 100 hit, a moment of TikTok virality or simply a very faithful (though modest) collection of devotees that allows them to sell out concerts at midsize venues around the world. But they have yet to make the leap to, or have failed to remain at, music’s mainstream center.Instead, they build careers off hooky, vividly toned meta-pop — songs that seem to actively address and play with the tropes of pop history — and with the help of fan bases that treat them as if they were as big as Taylor Swift. For these artists, pop stardom isn’t a commercial category, but a sound, an aesthetic and an attitude.ImageRita Ora has built a devoted fan base based on the fact that she seems unable to get a foothold in the United States. Credit...Gonzalo Marroquin/Getty Images for SpotifyThe streaming economy has essentially created a swath of pop stars who may never muster the virality or the major-label support required to reach the upper echelons of the charts or sell out stadiums, but nonetheless have devoted fan bases and consistent income from touring and licensing — essentially, the kind of model that indie musicians have relied upon for years. It may be miles away from the spectacle and flash usually associated with pop music, but it does provide a path toward something that, for decades, has proved elusive for a lot of aspirant pop stars: career sustainability.Some of these musicians, like Jepsen and Charli XCX, minted a hit (or a handful) early in their careers before settling into pop’s middle class; others, like Rexha and Max, consistently net genre hits, often in dance music, but have as yet failed to cement themselves as household names. Ora, a genuine chart success in the United Kingdom, has built a cultish fan base based on the fact that she seems unable to get a foothold in the United States. (Her most recent album, “You & I,” didn’t chart after its release in July.) As with many of these stars, Ora’s fans love her precisely because she is unsuccessful — a niche concern who operates with all of the pomp and pageantry of an A-lister.Artists like Sawayama and Caroline Polachek make music that has little commercial impact, but they have manipulated a pop-leaning sound that allows them to mount pop-style live shows and toy with pop aesthetics, while artists like Sivan and Carpenter always seem as if they’re teetering right on the edge of genuine megastardom, occasionally getting a hit to the lower echelons of the Hot 100, but rarely any higher.Petras, in particular, presents her work as a kind of meta-commentary on the nature of pop stardom itself. Her debut album, “Feed the Beast,” released in June, is built around crackling EDM beats, sledgehammer hooks and a genuine success: “Unholy,” a No. 1 hit with Sam Smith that won a Grammy in February. Did this success make her a true pop star? Not exactly. “Feed the Beast” debuted at No. 44 on the Billboard 200, selling the equivalent of 17,000 albums; it fell off the chart after just two weeks. “Alone,” a single featuring Nicki Minaj, spent one week on the Hot 100 in May.Max’s debut single, the synthy stomp “Sweet But Psycho,” hit No. 10 in 2019. Since then, she has followed a similar formula with diminishing returns; her latest album, “Diamonds & Dancefloors,” spent one week on the albums chart. Carpenter rose to fame as a Disney Channel star and has settled into solid midrange pop success: “Emails I Can’t Send” is her fifth, and so far most successful, LP, released last year and spawning “Nonsense,” a single that was briefly ubiquitous on the radio, but mustered a peak of No. 56 on the Hot 100. Rexha has 11 million Instagram followers, a swath of devoted “Rexhars” online and a recent Top 5 single, the David Guetta collaboration “I’m Good (Blue).” But as with so many other pop stars currently working — including Sivan, who starred on the buzzy HBO series “The Idol” — her celebrity seems to exist entirely separate from her commercial performance.ImageCharli XCX strikes a pose onstage in February.Credit...Bianca De Marchi/EPA, via ShutterstockThe common thread linking these musicians is that they don’t treat “pop music” as a commercial category, but as a discrete musical lineage with its own codes and conventions to be plundered and reinterpreted. It’s a point of view made possible by the kind of fame the internet has built and fostered: the idea that the term “pop star” is a measure of clout or name recognition, not a badge that directly correlates to commercial success.These pop stars essentially make genre records. Unlike those of bygone eras, who pillaged the underground in search of new sounds to bring to the mainstream, this brand of musician is fixated on pop’s own history. In many ways, it makes sense that they would read as capital-P Pop Stars to the denizens of a world as reference-obsessed as stan Twitter; much of this music feels as if it were made by and for a hard-core fan.Sivan’s recent single “Rush,” which peaked at No. 76 on the Hot 100 last month, weaves together heady ’00s-style house with a winking, Village People-esque chorus. Petras’s three full-length records each play like surveys of dance pop through the ages, less concerned with cutting-edge sounds than with loving tributes. Sawayama’s pop bricolage nods to Shania Twain, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park and the J-pop legend Utada Hikaru.In many ways, pop itself is shrinking. The Hot 100 is currently populated by country musicians (Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs), purveyors of regional sounds (Rema, Peso Pluma) and rap stars (Travis Scott, Gunna). Aside from a few holdouts like Swift and Miley Cyrus, relics of an era in which mainstream music was dominated by world-beating megawatt pop stars, there are few pop singers on the charts right now.For other contemporary pop stars, the act of releasing music itself feels incidental to their celebrity status. In recent years, Kesha — one of the dominant commercial forces of the 2010s, securing 10 Top 10s in the first four years of her career — has become known less for her music than for her longtime legal battle with the producer Dr. Luke; still a Twitter (now known as X) and tabloid fixture, her music is often the least-discussed thing about her. “Gag Order,” her latest album, debuted at No. 187 in May, selling the equivalent of 8,300 copies its first week.And then there is Charli XCX, who spent a large portion of her career making outré, abrasive records with a bevy of collaborators from the worlds of hyperpop and experimental electronic music. Once a true commercial prospect — during the early years of her career, Charli scored a handful of Hot 100 Top 10s, including the No. 1 Iggy Azalea collaboration “Fancy” — it seemed, for a while, as if Charli had willfully recused herself from the pop music Olympics, perhaps as a way of insulating herself against the major-label industry’s callous and often cruel whims.As it turned out, it was actually far simpler than that: She was just taking an aesthetic detour. Her mainstream-skewing fifth album “Crash,” released last year, was described by Charli herself as her “main pop girl moment” and debuted at No. 7, her highest Billboard 200 position yet. This month, her single “Speed Drive,” written for the “Barbie” soundtrack, became her first Hot 100 entry in nine years. It drove the point home: She can be a big-time pop star, if she so chooses.This article is supported by Critical Minded, an initiative to invest in the work of cultural critics from historically underrepresented backgrounds.";2023-08-14;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/arts/music/pop-musics-middle-class.html;2023-08-14;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESWHATHAPPENSWHENAPOPSTARISN’TTHATPOPULAR?
The New York Times;Dolly Parton Goes Arena Rock, and 9 More New Songs;Hear tracks by Jorja Smith, Rhiannon Giddens, Shakira and others.;"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new tracks. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage, and The Amplifier, a twice-weekly guide to new and old songs.Dolly Parton, ‘World on Fire’Dolly Parton has announced an album due Nov. 17, “Rockstar,” that will be full of remakes of hits, often joined by the original performers. But she also brought some songs of her own including this one, her worried, indignant assessment of a “World on Fire” that’s full of lies and conflict. It’s Dolly gone arena-rock goth, with power-chord blasts and martial drums. A gospelly bridge asks, “Can’t we rise above/Can’t we show some love?,” but then it’s back to minor chords as Parton belts her best intentions — “Let’s heal the hurt/let kindness work” — against a grim, stomping, “We Will Rock You”-style chant: “Whatcha gonna do when it all burns down?” Parton concludes by posing that same question. JON PARELESJoni Mitchell, ‘Both Sides Now (Live at the Newport Folk Festival 2022)’Joni Mitchell’s surprise appearance at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, bolstered and surrounded by dedicated admirers like Brandi Carlile, was a demonstration not only of gumption, support and resilience, but of enduring musicianship and control. “Both Sides Now” previews an official live album, “At Newport,” due July 28. As a piano ripples and strings swell behind her, with Carlile and Lucius adding vocal harmonies, Mitchell makes each phrase purposeful, reflective and improvisatory, and her lowered, roughened but precise voice makes every word a life lesson. PARELESRhiannon Giddens, ‘You’re the One’Fresh off winning the Pulitzer Prize for music for her opera, “Omar,” Rhiannon Giddens releases “You’re the One,” the title song of her first full album of her own songs (though she has written, adapted and collaborated widely). As she sings about finding a love that turns “shades of gray” into “a new Technicolor world,” the song explodes out of her string-band foundations — banjo and fiddle — into full-tilt rock choruses, bursting with euphoria. PARELESJorja Smith, ‘Little Things’A jazzy piano lick and frenetic beat drive the English R&B artist Jorja Smith’s new single “Little Things,” which captures the atmosphere of a vibey, intimate house party with a densely populated dance floor. “Just a little thing for you and I,” Smith intones before shrugging with a cool nonchalance. “And if it’s meant to be than that’s all right.” LINDSAY ZOLADZFatoumata Diawara and Roberto Fonseca, ‘Blues’Fatoumata Diawara, from Mali, rides a galloping six-beat modal groove topped by the Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca in “Blues,” which is by far the rawest song on her new album of international fusions, “London Ko.” She produced it with Damon Albarn of Gorillaz. The lyrics, in Bambara and English, are about gratitude to her family; the spirit is centered and fierce. PARELESShakira, ‘Acróstico’Acróstico means acrostic, and the first letters of the five-line verses for Shakira’s new song spell out the names of her sons, Milan and Sasha. It’s the latest missive following her breakup with the soccer player Gerard Piqué, and it’s a declaration of unswerving maternal devotion through her own pain. “Even if life treats me this way/I will be strong for you alone,” she sings over steadfast piano chords. “All I want is your happiness/And to be with you.” There’s a hint of U2’s “Every Breaking Wave” in the chorus as it climbs to a tremulous peak: wounded but resolutely compassionate. PARELESChristine and the Queens, ‘Tears Can Be So Soft’Hélöise Letissier, a.k.a. Chris, the songwriter and voice of Christine and the Queens, plunges into separation and consolation in “Tears Can Be So Soft.” It’s built on a sample of the string arrangement from Marvin Gaye’s “Feel All My Love Inside”: an octave-leaping, tremulous swoop that changes from major to minor. Chris sings about missing family, friends and a lover and crying while driving on the freeway, with only the warmth and release of tears for comfort; a string section pays witness. PARELESRob Moose featuring Phoebe Bridgers, ‘Wasted’Rob Moose’s violin mirrors Phoebe Bridgers’s nocturnal anxiety on “Wasted,” a song from Moose’s upcoming EP, “Inflorescence.” Plucked notes echo her tense nerves while a groaning bed of strings brings an added pathos to the lyrics, which were written by Bridgers’s collaborator Marshall Vore. “I used to have the energy to get mad, used to know how to say sorry,” Bridgers sings with wry self-judgment and an escalating intensity. “But now I’m back with none of that.” ZOLADZNatural Wonder Beauty Concept, ‘Sword’A keyboard loop that hints at harpsichord or koto, pitch-shifted vocals, sporadic drum thuds, bits of static and the sound of a sword being unsheathed run through “Sword,” a stubbornly fragile track by the singer Ana Roxanne and the producer DJ Python. They have collaborated as Natural Wonder Beauty Concept for an album due July 14. “Sword” is at once transparent and elusive, with barely intelligible lyrics — “Everyone passes through,” Roxanne coos — and a willingness to tweak everything; the last section lowers and slows down every element but remains enigmatic. PARELESBen Chasny & Rick Tomlinson, ‘Waking of Insects’Ben Chasny records as Six Organs of Admittance; Rick Tomlinson records as, among other names, Voice of the Seven Woods. Both love minimalist repetition and gradual unfoldings, and in 2017 they made an album of duets. “Waking of Insects” was recorded live, just two acoustic guitars. They share interlocking fingerpicked patterns and, with moments of dissonance, nudge one another toward new ones, very gradually making their way from quick, fluttering interplay to tolling repose.

The New York Times;Harry Styles Tries On Synth-Pop, and 13 More New Songs;Hear tracks by Angel Olsen, Koffee, Barrie and others.;Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.Harry Styles, ‘As It Was’In “As It Was,” Harry Styles latches on to the kind of peppy electro-pop that the Weeknd updated from groups like a-ha. The song is from Styles’s third album, “Harry’s House,” due May 20, and its insistently upbeat production stokes the ambiguity of the lyrics. When he sings, “In this world, it’s just us/You know it’s not the same as it was,” it’s impossible to tell whether he’s pulling away or longing to reunite. JON PARELESBarrie, ‘Jersey’The Brooklyn musician and producer Barrie Lindsay makes music that sounds like the work of an introvert with a kaleidoscopically vivid inner world. Throughout her tuneful, gently melancholy new album “Barbara,” there’s a muttered, endearingly modest quality to her vocal delivery that’s contrasted with her colorful, adventurous production choices. That signature push and pull can be heard on the album’s lush opening song “Jersey,” where, atop an intricately layered track, Lindsay shrugs sweetly, “You didn’t dream so long, I’m just the girl that you got.” LINDSAY ZOLADZAngel Olsen, ‘All the Good Times’Angel Olsen’s forthcoming album “Big Time,” out June 3, was written during an emotionally tumultuous moment in her life: At age 34, she came out as queer to her family, only to lose both of her parents, in quick succession, to illness shortly afterward. Olsen certainly knows how to capture and exorcise melodramatic feelings in her music — see: “Lark,” the bombastic leadoff track from her great 2019 album “All Mirrors” — but the first single from “Big Time” is more of a slow burn, smoldering and occasionally sparking with sudden, cathartic surges. Pivoting from the luscious synth-scapes of “All Mirrors,” “All the Good Times” harkens back to Olsen’s twangy roots, and its melody has a laid-back confidence that occasionally brings Willie Nelson to mind. “I’ll be long gone, thanks for the songs, guess it’s time to wake up from the trip we’ve been on,” Olsen sings, as the instrumentation swells to meet her suddenly impassioned croon. ZOLADZJensen McRae, ‘Take It Easy’“I don’t wanna talk about it any more,” the Los Angeles songwriter Jensen McRae announces as she begins “Take It Easy,” from her debut album, “Are You Happy Now?” But of course she does. The tone is serene, two chords riding a gentle Caribbean lilt, even as she sings about grappling with burdens that seem to be both physical and emotional. She wonders, “Atlas, did your back get sore?,” but she finds a graceful equilibrium. PARELESThomas Rhett featuring Katy Perry, ‘Where We Started’What is country music right now? It’s a far cry from great pickers and singers collaborating in real time, as it was in honky-tonk history. Like the rest of pop, it’s a construction. Thomas Rhett, a country superstar, sings about a romance with a waitress who’s hoping for a musical career, played by Katy Perry, in “Where We Started,” the last song but the title track of his new album. “I’d be playing my guitar singing those covers in an empty room,” she faux-recalls. The beats are programmed drum-machine tones, like trap, with guitars that sound like loops, and the collaboration with Perry may well have been remote. It’s an artificial path toward a real feeling. PARELESIbeyi featuring Jorja Smith, ‘Lavender and Red Roses’Hand drums and echoey, hovering voices give “Lavender and Red Roses” the atmosphere of a ritual procession, as Ibeyi — the French, Afro-Cuban twins Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz — and the English singer Jorja Smith bemoan a self-destructive partner: “I’ve welcomed you with open arms baby/But you still walk towards the dark lately,” they sing, as hope fades. PARELESMichael Leonhart Orchestra featuring Elvis Costello, Joshua Redman and JSWISS, ‘Shut Him Down’The Grammy-winning Michael Leonhart Orchestra converts itself into a crack studio band on “Shut Him Down,” the guest star-fueled opener to its newest album, playing a groove infused with the bubbling patter of Nigerian juju music. Elvis Costello takes center stage, rattling off a few shifty-eyed verses from the point of view of a man fighting a charge. Then the rapper JSWISS drops his own bars, toying with wordplay and internal rhyme, before the tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman carries things to a close. Always an effusive improviser, he threatens to blow the lid off this medium-boiling track, but ultimately plays along with the chill, jammy vibe. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLOJuanita Euka, ‘Motema’Over the interplay of two crinkly, echo-laden guitars, the Congolese-born vocalist Juanita Euka sings with an easy confidence on “Motema,” which means “heart” in Lingala. The track comes from “Mabanzo,” the debut album from this young heir apparent (her uncle, Franco Luambo Makiadi, was a rumba star in Congo), who grew up in Buenos Aires and has lately become a promising voice on the London music scene. RUSSONELLOKoffee, ‘Where I’m From’The Grammy-winning Jamaican singer Koffee (Mikayla Simpson) widely stretches the reggae idiom on her debut album, “Gifted,” pulling in dembow, Afrobeats and more. In “Where I’m From,” she sing-raps about tough beginnings and current success, with a scrubbing funk guitar that echoes “Shaft,” a heaving bass line, ominous piano interjections and wordless choir harmonies that are at once mournful and lofty. PARELESVince Staples, ‘Rose Street’“I don’t sing no love songs, ain’t never sang no love songs,” Vince Staples proclaims at the top of “Rose Street,” and the title of the upcoming album it’ll appear on is possibly an explanation: “Ramona Park Broke My Heart.” As he raps nimbly atop a bass-heavy, vaguely ghostly beat, though, he gradually lets his guard down and confesses the reasons he’s reluctant to commit to the girl who wants him to stick around. “I promise you, you don’t gotta stress, it’s gon’ be OK,” he assures her before admitting, “OK, I’m lying, living day by day.” ZOLADZPup, ‘Totally Fine’The Toronto band Pup has long made frenetic punk-pop with neat verse-chorus-bridge structures underlying Stefan Babcock’s raucously overwrought and fully self-aware lead vocals. “Totally Fine,” from the band’s fourth album, “The Unraveling of Puptheband,” cranks everything up: feedback, drums, high and low guitars, Babcock’s blurted admission that “I just couldn’t decide/Whether I’m at my worst or I’m totally fine.” And then it cranks up further, with a big, stadium-ready singalong. The video, a fine sendup of tech-bro vanity, is a bonus. PARELESsadie, ‘Nowhere’Anna Schwab, the Brooklyn songwriter and producer who records as sadie, uses the twitchy double time, the computer-warped vocals and the cheap-sounding presets of hyperpop as a digital native. Yet in “Nowhere,” she also conveys something more than games-playing: a sense of how hard it is to cope with the pressures of 21st-century romance. “Think I’ll get it all right/Then it’s over,” she sings with knowing resignation. PARELESFlume featuring Caroline Polachek, ‘Sirens’In her purest soprano, Caroline Polachek sings her most benevolent aspirations, written during a pandemic peak: “If I could I’d raise my arm/And wave a wand to end all harm.” The Australian electronic musician Flume and his co-producer, Danny L. Harle, give her ethereal support at first — tremulous string tones and echoey arpeggios — but then throw up all sorts of sonic obstacles: clattering, thudding, lurching, scraping, distorting, and even bringing back the sirens she wishes she never had to hear again. PARELESGerald Clayton featuring Charles Lloyd, ‘Peace Invocation’The coolly warbling saxophone sound of Charles Lloyd, 84, is unmistakable on “Peace Invocation,” a duet with the pianist Gerald Clayton that appears on the younger musician’s newest album, “Bells on Sand.” The influence of a couple of other legendary saxophonist-composers hangs over this track, too: There’s the open-ended, shadow-casting style of Wayne Shorter, and hints of John Coltrane’s classic “Naima” in the irresolution of Clayton’s bittersweet melody.

The New York Times;A Band’s First U.S. Tour Starts With a Rite of Passage: Getting Robbed;Forests, an emo band from Singapore, ended its tour in New York in high spirits, two weeks after being robbed in California.;An international rock band’s first U.S. tour is a moment to be celebrated, a sign that years of hard work have paid off. But just a few days into their American debut, the members of Forests, an emo rock band from Singapore, endured another rite of passage for some musicians traveling the United States when they stopped for the night at a California hotel.When they returned to their rental van a few hours later, they realized they’d been robbed.“In Singapore I kind of made a joke about it, like, oh, you know, your band is only legit if your stuff got stolen,” said Darell Laser, 36, the bassist. “Then it really happened.”Forests and the Oklahoma band they were touring with, Ben Quad, are hardly the first musicians to be robbed while on tour in America. (In 1999, Sonic Youth famously lost an entire truck’s worth of gear to a thief, also in California.) But the experience was still a shock for a band from a country as safe as Singapore.“It was the worst luck ever,” said Chris Martinez, 29, a Forests fan from San Diego who discovered the band years ago on a business trip to Singapore.The robbery prompted an outpouring of concern from both bands’ fans, and more than $9,000 in donations allowed them to buy replacement instruments. They did not miss a show, and they ended their tour in high spirits with a sold-out concert at a bar in Queens on Tuesday.“They seem to have moved past it,” said Mr. Martinez, who donated $200 to the bands’ crowdfunding campaign after learning of the robbery. “Keeping a positive attitude and trying not to let it bring them down.”ImageForests and Ben Quad had some instruments, along with other goods, stolen from their parked rental van while they were sleeping in a hotel after a show. Credit...ForestsThe May 1 robbery made for a surreal early leg of a cross-country tour — entitled “Get in losers, we’re going to Walmart” — that Forests had spent months planning and years looking forward to. It happened a few days after their tour began in Seattle and a few hours after their gig in Oakland.When the tired musicians from the two bands straggled into a Hampton Inn in Hayward, Calif., at about 1:30 a.m., they left their gear in the 15-passenger rental van they were sharing for the tour. They parked next to a security camera as a precaution, but it didn’t help: When they returned to the parking lot after 11 a.m., they noticed that some of their guitars, a bass, pedals, clothing and a box with cash from merchandise sales had been stolen.The theft was the latest in an area of California where property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins are on the rise. The hotel management told the bands that its security footage did not show a theft. A location tag on one instrument appeared to show that the stolen gear had been taken to an Oakland apartment building, but the police said there was no easy way to get it back.“The cops told us, ‘Hey, there’s nothing we can do unless it ends up in a pawnshop,’” said Edgar Viveros, 27, Ben Quad’s lead guitarist. The pawnshops they called said that it had not.Instead of canceling the tour, the bands decided to play on with borrowed gear. They also set up a crowdfunding page and were surprised to see how quickly donations rolled in — $6,000 in about four hours.The robbery was “kinda heartbreaking,” Imre Griga, 23, a fan in Columbia, Mo., who attended three of the bands’ tour dates this month, said in an email. “I think the entire community felt Forests deserved much better for their first tour in America.”Within a few days, members of both bands were playing with new instruments. They went a little longer without the pedal board that Ben Quad typically uses to play samples, like the theme from an “Austin Powers” movie, between sets. But a replacement for that, too, was eventually found.ImageForests first played with borrowed instruments after the theft, then bought replacements after fans donated more than $9,000.Credit...ForestsBack home in Singapore, the story of the robbery, and the fan support, made headlines. Some readers commented about their own experiences of getting robbed in the United States. Others wondered how the three members of Forests, who all have day jobs and tour on their vacations, could have been so naïve.For Forests, it was not their first international tour: They have performed across the Asia-Pacific region over the years. But on their first tour of America, they loved watching the landscape — deserts, trees, snowy mountains — whip past the van’s windows.They also kept a list of “crazy things” they had seen, like people fighting in convenience stores, or the woman in Seattle who threw her luggage down three flights of stairs in a subway station. The band’s drummer, Niki Koh, 31, said he particularly enjoyed visiting a store that sold guns, knives and hunting gear — “everything that we won’t find in Singapore.”“It’s culture shock,” he said, speaking in a video interview from Kansas City. “But at the same time, it’s very interesting.”;2023-05-19;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/arts/music/singapore-band-forests-robbed-us.html;2023-05-21;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESABAND’SFIRSTU.S.TOURSTARTSWITHARITEOFPASSAGE:GETTINGROBBED
The New York Times;SZA’s ‘SOS’ Holds Off Taylor Swift for a Fourth Week at No. 1;Both artists introduced new digital versions of their albums, bringing a tight race to a typically sleepy week on the Billboard charts.;The R&B singer and songwriter SZA has edged out Taylor Swift to hold at No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart for a fourth time, attaining a notable victory during what is usually the post-holiday sales doldrums.“SOS,” the long-awaited second LP by SZA, who was born Solána Rowe in St. Louis and raised in suburban New Jersey, had the equivalent of 125,000 sales in the United States last week. That total included 162 million streams and about 3,000 copies sold as a complete package, according to the tracking service Luminate.It is the first time an album by a woman has held at No. 1 four consecutive times since Adele’s “30,” which reigned for six weeks at the end of 2021, Billboard reported. (Swift’s “Midnights” notched five No. 1’s over a six-week stretch last fall.) “SOS” is also the first R&B title by a woman to rack up four weeks at the top since Alicia Keys’s “As I Am” (2007).“SOS,” a steady streaming hit that features guest spots by Travis Scott, Phoebe Bridgers and other artists, faced stiff competition last week from “Midnights.” Both SZA and Swift released special digital versions of their albums to lure fans. SZA sold two versions, containing extra tracks, while Swift’s website sold four editions, featuring variant artwork and bonus commentary cuts, for one day only.Swift’s promotion helped “Midnights” move the equivalent of 117,000 sales, up 10 percent from the week before, including 58,000 copies sold as a complete package. “Midnights” holds at No. 2 for a fifth week in a row.Also this week, a number of recent hits crawl back up the chart as holiday albums disappear like so many Christmas trees hauled to the curb. “Heroes & Villains” by the rap producer Metro Boomin rises one spot to No. 3, Drake and 21 Savage’s “Her Loss” is No. 4 and Bad Bunny’s “Un Verano Sin Ti” is in fifth place.Morgan Wallen’s “Dangerous: The Double Album,” which dipped below the Top 10 for two weeks at the end of the year, jumps back five spots to No. 6. Since its release two years ago, “Dangerous” has notched a total of 101 weeks in the Top 10, dropping out only three times during the holiday-albums crushes in 2021 and 2022.;2023-01-09;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/arts/music/sza-sos-billboard-chart.html;2023-01-11;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESSZA’S‘SOS’HOLDSOFFTAYLORSWIFTFORAFOURTHWEEKATNO.1

Her true talents were marketing and exposing her body, not musical proficiency.Her lack of creative and emotional authenticity is why she can never be in the same league as other female musical artists such as Joni Mitchell, Nina Simone, Lucinda Williams, Billie Holiday and Aretha Franklin. She was, at best, a passing social phenomenon on the cusp of dance trends.Madonna’s complaints of sexism and ageism miss the mark, too. We would scoff at the sight of former male teen idols donning sexy clothes in their soft middle age. Joni and Lucinda and Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney, for that matter, remain beautiful and relevant at any age because of their musical legacy, not plastic surgery and skin exposure.And they are still producing meaningful music.Christopher WanjekBaltimoreTo the Editor:I’d like to note one other instance of Madonna’s willingness to fight against bigotry. In 2009, Madonna toured the world with a group of Roma musicians, with tour stops that included countries where anti-Roma racism still runs rampant.As head of the European Roma Rights Center at the time, I reached out to her through her publicist and through one of her band members and encouraged her to speak out on behalf of Roma, the largest and most oppressed minority in Europe. I got no response and thought it a wasted effort.Then in August, at a concert in Romania in front of 60,000 people, she spoke out against anti-Roma discrimination. A small gesture, and not one likely to sell tickets. Indeed she was roundly booed at the concert for her remarks.Still we can only hope that, in the words of the Rev.

The New York Times;Record Executive’s Art Collection to Be Auctioned at Sotheby’s in May;Mo Ostin, a force in the music industry who died in August, was also an art enthusiast whose major works include Magritte, Basquiat and Twombly.;"Publicly, Mo Ostin was a powerful executive in the music industry for almost 50 years who worked with some of the most respected musicians of the 20th century — Frank Sinatra, Jimi Hendrix, Madonna, Neil Young — before his death in August at age 95.But privately, Ostin was an art collector who loved the “ritual” of touring museums and galleries and getting to know about artists, according to his son Michael Ostin, and he never bought more than he could fit in his home.“There was a toughness in the way that he could look at and appraise things,” Lorne Michaels, the creator of “Saturday Night Live” and a friend of Mo Ostin’s, said in a recent phone interview.Next month, the Mo Ostin Collection, made up of more than 30 drawings and paintings by 20th- and 21st-century artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein and Cecily Brown valued in excess of $120 million, will be auctioned at Sotheby’s on May 16 and 19, the auction house announced Tuesday. “This collection is the highlight and centerpiece of our May auction season in New York,” said Brooke Lampley, Sotheby’s chairman and worldwide head of sales for global fine art.At the center of the collection are two major Surrealist paintings that had pride of place in Ostin’s home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. In the family room, on either side of the fireplace, he and his wife, Evelyn, hung works by the Belgian painter René Magritte: “The Domain of Arnheim,” executed in 1949, and “The Empire of Light,” from 1951.Putting a Price Tag on ArtCard 1 of 6Hot commodities. Paintings and other art pieces are regularly sold at auctions around the world. Here are some of the most expensive works to be sold in recent years:“Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” by Andy Warhol. In May 2022, Warhol’s 1964 silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe’s face sold — in under four minutes of bidding — for about $195 million, the highest price achieved for any American work of art at auction.“Untitled” by Jean-Michel Basquiat. A 1982 Basquiat painting of a horned devil sold for $85 million with fees in May 2022. It was the third-highest price paid for a Basquiat work; the highest price was recorded in 2017, when one of Basquiat’s coveted large-scale skull paintings sold for $110.5 million at Sotheby’s.“L’empire des lumières” by René Magritte. The painting, one of Magritte’s famed “Empire of Light” canvases, sold in March 2022 for 59.4 million pounds with fees, or about $79.7 million. The artwork, which juxtaposes a nocturnal lamplit street with a serene daylit sky, is one of the most celebrated and enigmatic images in 20th-century art.“Diego and I” by Frida Kahlo. An oil painting by Frida Kahlo sold for $34.9 million at Sotheby’s in November 2021, setting an auction benchmark for the most expensive artwork by a Latin American artist. The painting is one of Kahlo’s final self-portraits and an example of the unsettling intimacy that has attracted collectors to her paintings.“Composition No. II” by Piet Mondrian. A classic grid painting by Mondrian sold at Sotheby’s in November 2022 for $51 million, including fees, topping the previous $50.6 million benchmark for his work. The painting epitomizes the primary colors and geometric rigidity of the de Stijl movement that Mondrian helped define.“The Domain of Arnheim,” estimated to sell for $15 million to $25 million, is part of a series inspired by the Edgar Allan Poe story of the same name, in which the protagonist seeks to “create the perfect landscape.” In Magritte’s work, a broken window frames a mountain ridge in the shape of an eagle while the fallen pieces of glass portray the natural landscape above. “The Empire of Light,” with an estimate of $35 million to $45 million, is one of 17 such oil paintings in which the artist juxtaposes an evening landscape with a sunlit sky.ImageOstin, shown around 1970, had “a toughness in the way that he could look at an appraise things,” said Lorne Michaels, a friend of the executive.Credit...Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesAs an executive, Ostin developed an artist-first philosophy that gave wide latitude to the talents he believed in. In 1977, he signed Prince to a three-album deal and gave him full creative control. “It was never about chasing hits,” Michael Ostin said of his father. “He always thought that you find the best talent, and you empower them to do their best work. And if, in fact, if they made great records, then the popularity would follow.”Trust your instincts, follow what you love, and success will come. That was Ostin’s approach, and sometimes he shared it with key figures in other sectors of the entertainment industry.In 1985, Michaels was at a crossroads. He had stepped away from “Saturday Night Live” in 1980 to pursue independent projects, and wrote the film “Three Amigos” with Steve Martin and Randy Newman. But by 1985, Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC Entertainment at the time, gave Michaels an ultimatum. “If you come back we’ll keep it, but if not, we’ll cancel it,” Tartikoff said about the future of “S.N.L.”“I had a really hard decision,” Michaels said in a recent phone interview, and Ostin gave “the best advice.”Ostin, then chairman and chief executive at Warner Bros. Records, told Michaels: “It’d be hard going back because it’s a different time, but it’s what you love.”“S.N.L.” could have disappeared after a 10-year run, but the show is approaching its 50th anniversary season — an achievement that in part reflects the influence of Ostin.ImageLike all 33 of the works in the sale, Willem de Kooning’s “Two Figures” (1946-47) came from Ostin’s home.Credit...The Willem de Kooning Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; via Sotheby'sEven after Ostin retired, his love for music drew him across the world. Ostin and Michaels watched the Who’s 50th anniversary concert in Hyde Park London in 2015, standing on a plank on the side of the stage. “I looked at him and I thought, he’s 86, he’s right here,” Michaels, 78, said. “You can keep going as long as you want.”As a collector, Ostin was thorough. “He deeply, deeply loved it,” said Martin, who is also an avid art collector. “He could talk about it and look at it for hours.” Together at the Tate museum in London around the late ’90s, they heard that Norman Granz, the jazz impresario and executive of Clef Records, had a Picasso for sale. “It was a gorgeous Dora Maar painting,” Martin said.Ostin started his career in the music industry at Clef (which was later renamed Verve Records) in 1954, after dropping out of U.C.L.A law school. Through Granz, a friend and collector of Picasso, Ostin was exposed to fine art. “When he came into money,” Michaels said of Ostin, “it was a big priority for him.”The 33 works for sale at Sotheby’s comprise 90 percent of the art Ostin owned, and all came from his home. A small Willem de Kooning painting hung above the two Magrittes in the main living room, where a large Joan Mitchell painting faced them; in the dining room, two Picassos appeared on either side of a fireplace, below an Arshile Gorky painting. Three Cy Twombly works welcomed guests in the entryway.Surrounded by art, it was natural that Ostin’s son Michael, 68 — formerly an executive of Warner Bros. and president of DreamWorks, currently managing A Tribe Called Quest, Q-Tip and D’Angelo — also became a collector.His father’s advice: “Trust your taste, listen to your gut, and buy what you love.”";2023-04-11;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/arts/design/mo-ostin-art-auction-sothebys.html;2023-04-12;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESRECORDEXECUTIVE’SARTCOLLECTIONTOBEAUCTIONEDATSOTHEBY’SINMAY
The New York Times;Björk, Still Using Style to Captivate;A look back at some of the artist’s best looks over the years, as she releases her 10th studio album, “Fossora.”;"One might be hard pressed to recall which film took home best picture at the 2001 Academy Awards. But what Björk wore to the ceremony may evoke a different response.The singer, who was nominated for best original song for “I’ve Seen It All,” from Lars von Trier’s film “Dancer in the Dark,” in which she also starred, strode down the red carpet in a dress designed by Marjan Pejoski. In true Björk fashion, it wasn’t just any dress. The creation — a cluster of white tulle and feathers that came to an apex in the form of a swan with its neck draped over the shoulder — didn’t immediately register as a fashion moment. The look was panned by fashion critics, a regular on worst-dressed lists and the subject of talk-show roasts.Years later, the memory of the “swan dress” has endured. Featured at a Met Gala exhibit and a familiar entry in the Halloween costume genre, Björk’s dress was a meme before memes and internet spoofs had a place in the cultural consciousness. It was red carpet performance art before the arrival of Lady Gaga’s meat dress or Billy Porter’s mechanical diamanté cowboy hat.Between Bjork’s genre-busting music and avant-garde fashion choices, the world has always been a few strides behind her. Few pop stars dared to wear the inventive creations of Comme des Garçons, Junya Watanabe or Hussein Chalayan in the ’90s, but Björk immortalized the looks on her album covers and gave them lives beyond the runways.ImageThe artist wore what has become known as the “swan dress” at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony.Credit...Lucy Nicholson/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDecades deep into her career, Björk still has not diluted the potency of her expressive taste. She’s embarked on five tours over the past 10 years; each is a full-scale production with whizzing light schemes, surrealist landscapes and orchestral ensembles emphasizing every note.Clothes remain essential expressions of the Björk experience. For a 2019 performance in New York, her longtime collaborator the designer Iris van Herpen devised a moving dress, which Ms. van Herpen has described as “inspired by a future orchid-avatar that is hovering like an aura around her body,” that illuminated Björk onstage. Other designers have also lent some of their most off-kilter pieces for her performances, including the voluminous Balenciaga ball gown from its summer 2020 collection that Björk wore during her Orkestral Tour in Iceland and the puffer ball gown from Pierpaolo Piccioli for Moncler she wore this year at the Bluedot festival in England. Bjork also found an admirer in Gucci’s Alessandro Michele, who designed a crimson latex dress for her music video “Ovule,” from her new album, “Fossora.” Here is a look back at Björk’s most momentous fashion moments.Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicMTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS, 1994What do you wear to your first V.M.A. red carpet?

The New York Times;Beyoncé’s ‘Break My Soul’ and the Long Tail of ‘Show Me Love’;The ubiquitous 1992 remix of Robin S.’s song has endured in samples and covers. Its writers’ names appeared in the credits for Beyoncé’s track, were quickly removed and then restored again.;"The intro is unmistakable for anyone who’s been on a dance floor in the last three decades. A grinding synth line and tactile thump give way to the instrumental pièce de résistance: an organ springy enough to conjure bouncing balls. Then, a human yowl cuts through with the urgency of a distress signal.Robin S.’s “Show Me Love” has “probably become the most ubiquitous dance song in modern history,” said Larry Flick, who was the dance editor of Billboard at the time of the track’s 1993 breakout. At this point, the song has been remixed, remade and referenced more than 100 times, according to the website WhoSampled. It never really went away — Charli XCX uses it as the spine of “Used to Know Me” from her 2022 album, “Crash.”The track came roaring back into public consciousness last Monday night with the release of Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul,” the frenetic first single from her anticipated album “Renaissance,” due July 29. Listeners heard echoes of “Show Me Love,” and when it debuted on streaming services, the “Show Me Love” writers Allen George and Fred McFarlane were credited on the new track, alongside Adam Pigott; Big Freedia, who appears on the song; Jay-Z; and its three producers, Terius Nash (known as The-Dream), Christopher “Tricky” Stewart and Beyoncé. Robin S. — real name: Robin Jackson Maynard — went on British TV last Wednesday to thank Beyoncé “for giving me my flowers while I’m still alive,” and critics debated the merits of the sonic nod in blog posts and reviews.But in an unusual turn of events that got fans chattering all over again, the credits to “Break My Soul” were changed on streaming services by last Wednesday night, removing George and McFarlane. Over the weekend, they changed again, and the two “Show Me Love” writers returned. Reached before the adjustments, a representative for Stewart declined to comment; Beyoncé’s representative at her company Parkwood Entertainment — which, with Beyoncé’s label, Columbia, supplied the credits to streaming outlets — did not respond to several email inquiries.The practice of adding songwriters to already written songs is “very, very” popular, said Christopher Buccafusco, a law professor at the Cardozo School of Law. “Someone along the line may decide that the song sounds a little too close to stuff that exists already,” he said. But, he noted, “Typically people don’t just drop authors’ names onto songs to credit them unless they’ve negotiated, unless they’ve talked to them.”The version of “Show Me Love” that became a global hit and peaked at No. 5 on the Hot 100 in 1993 was actually a remix by the Swedish dance producer Sten Hallström, who records as StoneBridge. (Some 12” records credit StoneBridge and his frequent collaborator Nick Nice together on remixes, but on the specific one in question, StoneBridge told The New York Times, “I did it myself.”) George and McFarlane’s original version had been made in 1989, according to Robin S. The production was disco-inflected and conventional, as was typical for that period of house music, and when it was released in 1990, it went precisely nowhere.StoneBridge, then an up-and-coming producer, asked Champion, the label that had released “Show Me Love” in the United Kingdom, for possible material to remix.“Champion were obsessed with sweet and sour, they called it,” StoneBridge, now 60, recalled via phone from his studio in Stockholm. He dialed his Korg M1 synthesizer to the next preset, landing on Organ 2, and replayed his bass line. That was the bouncy, sweet part. The sour was the grinding sound that opens the song, a product of his DX100 Yamaha synth, which he played in the red to distort it. He dusted it all, as well as Robin S.’s vocal, with some delay. The result was minimal like early house music out of Chicago, but shimmering with novel sounds. StoneBridge was not sure about his concoction, but deadline compelled him to turn it in.When Robin S. heard it, it blew her away, she said in an interview last week. Finally her song was complete.She had recorded her vocal years before in one take (not counting the ad-libs) while suffering from the flu, she recalled over the phone from her home in Atlanta. She was initially unimpressed by the song; and then, years later with StoneBridge’s revision, its popularity exploded on a global scale. “Show Me Love” was not the first house song to feature the M1 Organ 2 sound, but it hit bigger than any that came before it.Earlier last week, Robin S. got a call from her son informing her that she was trending on social media as a result of the apparent “Show Me Love” reference in Beyoncé’s song, which replicates that M1 Organ 2 sound (in a different rhythm). She and StoneBridge both said they had no idea what was coming. StoneBridge discovered the connection while searching for his name on Twitter.“I didn’t know whether to laugh, to cry,” Robin S., 60, said. “Out of all the songs she has access to, out of all the songs her team has access to, she chose mine.” The singer said she was particularly touched because she’s felt that dance artists like her “don’t get their props” despite their hard work.ImageRobin S. in 1996. Three years before, a remix of her song “Show Me Love” became a hit.Credit...Raymond Boyd/Getty ImagesRobin S. declined to say how much she was paid for the recording of “Show Me Love,” which she did not write. “I’m just going to say this: I made money from performances,” she said. She took a leave of absence from her role as executive secretary for the mayor of Hempstead on Long Island when her song hit in 1993, and today maintains a job that she also declined to specify. She tours regularly. Her website lists 19 upcoming shows, most of them in Europe this summer.While the sound of StoneBridge’s remix is what Beyoncé appears to be referencing on her track, StoneBridge had no songwriting credit on “Show Me Love.” He called the resulting scenario “just a little bit irritating,” but because he added to the song via remix, he does not qualify as an original composer.StoneBridge is also not convinced that Beyoncé’s song actually used portions of his remix. “To my ears they used the organ bass sound and did a similar thing,” he said. “It’s not like a sample.” (Beyoncé’s team has played things carefully in the past, giving credit on “6 Inch” from “Lemonade” to Animal Collective for using a similar turn of phrase.)Nevertheless, the arrival of “Break My Soul” turned into a nuanced interrogation of ownership in contemporary popular music, and revived conversations about the impact of “Show Me Love.” (Though to some ears, the Beyoncé track nodded to another McFarlane and George composition, “Luv 4 Luv.”)In 1993, StoneBridge’s production created the impression that “the European dance world had come up with a new idea as opposed to appropriating American ideas,” according to Flick, the former Billboard editor, who is now a music curator at Vero. Tracks utilizing the M1’s Organ 2 sound like Livin’ Joy’s 1994 song “Dreamer” followed. Then many others did, too. There’s a similarly cavernous vibe and bouncy bass line echoed in megahits like Kylie Minogue’s “Can’t Get You Out of My Head” from 2001 and Kiesza’s “Hideaway” from 2014.“Show Me Love” has been referenced by Daddy Yankee and Jason Derulo, and covered by Clean Bandit and the xx. A version by Sam Feldt featuring Kimberly Anne hit the Top 5 in the U.K. in 2015. Robin S. has rerecorded it several times, most recently in a disco-fied remix by Emmaculate released last year. She has sung it “a gazillion and plus times,” and said that since the song took off, she has never once played a concert and not performed it.Flick said its enduring appeal derives from that Organ 2 sound and “the rawness of the vocal,” which he described as having “a church quality.” Ultimately, “It still sounds modern,” he said.Slapping an M1 Organ 2 sound on a track has proved to be such a surefire way to resonate with listeners that Flick suggested it was “a cheat” for Beyoncé to employ it. The sound reached new levels of penetration in the 2010s, during the “deep house” revival in the U.K., and at this point is well-worn material even for A-list stars — you can hear its influence on Jennifer Lopez’s 2011 track “On the Floor,” Katy Perry’s 2017 “Swish Swish,” and all over Lady Gaga’s 2020 album “Chromatica.”As much as pop music relies on innovation, sometimes all it takes is a good idea or two to forge a subgenre. “A lot of songs are complicated — lots of chords and melodies playing all over the place,” StoneBridge said, pondering his remix’s impact. “This one is very easy to get. I think that helps.”";2022-06-27;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/arts/music/beyonce-break-my-soul-robin-s-show-me-love.html;2022-06-30;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESBEYONCé’S‘BREAKMYSOUL’ANDTHELONGTAILOF‘SHOWMELOVE’
The New York Times;‘Conan,’ ‘Goodfellas’ and MTV: How Tony Bennett Revived His Career;Mr. Bennett’s career went downhill in the 1970s, as drug and financial problems haunted him. Then his son became his manager, and everything took a rags-to-riches turn.;"In the 1970s, Tony Bennett’s career and life were in disarray.He was performing mostly in Las Vegas, a declining city that glued him to a bygone era. His music was out of vogue — his last Top 40 single had been in 1965. He was using cocaine heavily. And his finances were in ruin, prompting the Internal Revenue Service to threaten to take his home.Well into the 1980s, it seemed that everything was going wrong for the singer.Then came a comeback for the ages.The rebirth of Mr. Bennett, who died on Friday, ensured that he would remain one of the most revered singers of American popular music for generations to come. And he did it by staying true to his calling as a champion of the standards known as the Great American Songbook.Mr. Bennett managed a career resurgence in the late 1980s and ’90s without changing much about his music. All it took was meeting members of a new audience where they were: late-night talk show appearances, a cameo on “The Simpsons” and a memorable performance on “MTV Unplugged” in 1994 that led to constant airplay on the network and a surprise Grammy for album of the year.Generation X, which prized the authenticity of indie and grunge rock, was ready for the unadorned voice of a 60-something Tony Bennett.“That period was, in fact, a Tony Bennett renaissance, pure and simple,” said Robert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.Other musical artists have experienced similar resurgences: Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God),” from 1985, reached millions of new fans last year after it was featured on “Stranger Things” and topped the charts; Abba released a new album in 2021, its first in decades; in 2002, a remix of Elvis’s “A Little Less Conversation” became a global smash, decades after he had died.But what makes Mr. Bennett’s career arc remarkable is that he won over new generations of young people as he released albums and toured across the country into his 60s and far beyond, said Ariana Wyatt, an associate professor in the School of Performing Arts at Virginia Tech. His popularity was bolstered whenever he paired up with younger stars, such as Lady Gaga, with whom he last performed in 2021.“Usually when you hit that age that he was in the ’80s, you’re kind of over,” Ms. Wyatt said. “It is not standard, that kind of resurgence and regaining of mainstream popularity.”The comeback story begins after Mr. Bennett nearly died in 1979, when he was high in an overflowing tub. Soon after, he turned to his older son, Danny Bennett, to manage his career.Danny Bennett did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment on Friday night, but in a 1999 interview with The New York Times, he recounted the moment his father had asked for his help.The I.R.S. was seeking to collect $2 million in back taxes from Mr. Bennett, causing the singer to turn to drugs for escape. When the I.R.S. called his accountants to warn that his house would be seized, Mr. Bennett took drugs and had to be rushed to the hospital, Danny Bennett said at the time.“That was the day of reckoning,” Danny Bennett said. “That is when he called me up. I think that was a desperate move.”Danny Bennett was then a 25-year-old punk rocker with long, dyed-blue hair and no college degree. But he said he believed that if his father could be marketed as a living American legend, a genial master of his craft, his career could be revived.The strategy worked.ImageTony Bennett won two Grammy awards in 1995, including album of the year for “MTV Unplugged.”Credit...Associated PressMany have speculated on why exactly young people began to fall in love with Mr. Bennett’s songs all over again.It might have been their universal appeal — simple lyrics and melody, a comforting yet sometimes raspy voice — that helped Mr. Bennett transcend generations, Mr. Thompson said.“Tony Bennett’s style, by not being aggressively timely, therefore becomes itself timeless,” Mr. Thompson said.Danny Bennett’s direction also helped; his father remained in his musical lane, singing the same classic songs that had brought him to fame in the 1950s.Mr. Bennett was soon regularly appearing on late-night TV shows, starting with David Letterman. Younger audiences came to love the New Yorker singing melancholic, jazzy tunes with a smile.“My next guest is truly one of the great singers of all time,” Mr. Letterman said in 1986, introducing Mr. Bennett, who wore a dark suit and tie and swayed as he bellowed “Everybody Has the Blues.”In 1993, Conan O’Brien noted Mr. Bennett’s rise in popularity before asking, “What’s going on?”“All the young adults in America, they consider me cool,” a bewildered Mr. Bennett said before being showered with applause.Indeed, young Americans did love Mr. Bennett, and a big reason for that was MTV, which at that time was still courting them with music videos that defined pop culture.In 1994, Mr. Bennett performed on “MTV Unplugged,” with guest appearances from the singer-songwriters K.D. Lang and Elvis Costello. The album version would go on to win the Grammy for album of the year, causing a shocked Mr. Bennett to say onstage while accepting the award, “I really don’t believe it.”MTV would play his songs alongside those of alternative rock stalwarts like Weezer and Green Day.“When you’re looking at the ’90s, the real kind of important place for music invention was this MTV audience,” Ms. Wyatt said.Movies and television shows also helped cement Mr. Bennett’s place in pop culture. “Goodfellas,” the Martin Scorsese mob movie released in 1990, opens with an iconic sequence: Mr. Bennett bellowing the opening lines “Rags to Riches,” as Ray Liotta’s character begins narrating his life in the mafia. Mr. Bennett also started playing himself in films and TV shows like “The Simpsons” and “Analyze This,” the 1999 mafia comedy film starring Robert De Niro.In his 2012 memoir, “Life is a Gift: The Zen of Bennett,” the singer wrote that in the 1960s, he was told he had to change his music for new generations to accept him.“Yet through the years, every age responds to my singing,” Mr. Bennett said, “even though I haven’t changed a thing.”";2023-07-22;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/arts/tony-bennett-career-1990s.html;2023-07-23;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMES‘CONAN,’‘GOODFELLAS’ANDMTV:HOWTONYBENNETTREVIVEDHISCAREER
The New York Times;Jon Zazula, Early Promoter of Heavy Metal, Dies at 69;With his wife, Marsha, he founded Megaforce, a label that released the first albums of Metallica and others.;"Jon Zazula, who with his wife, Marsha, founded Megaforce Records and was an important figure in the emergence of heavy metal music, giving Metallica, Anthrax and other bands their start, died on Tuesday at his home in Clermont, Fla. He was 69.Maria Ferrero, the couple’s first employee at the label and later the founder of Adrenaline PR, which specializes in promoting metal bands, said the cause was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, a neurological condition. Marsha Zazula died in January of last year at 68.Metallica memorialized Mr. Zazula in posts on its Twitter feed.“In 1982, when no one wanted to take a chance on four kids from California playing a crazy brand of metal, Jonny and Marsha did, and the rest, as they say, is history,” the band said.At that time, the Zazulas were trying to make a few bucks selling records from their collection of hard-to-find albums and picture discs at a flea market in East Brunswick, N.J. Their stock was heavy on metal, and their cubbyhole store, Rock N Roll Heaven, became a gathering spot for metalheads. At their customers’ urging, they started a D.I.Y. concert-promoting business to present some of the bands whose music they were selling; their first concert, in 1982, featured the Canadian band Anvil and drew almost 2,000 people.At some point someone brought them a demo tape by an unknown West Coast band, Metallica. The Zazulas liked what they heard, so much so that they contacted the members of the group and urged them to come east and play a few shows. Soon they had formed Megaforce, which released Metallica’s first two albums, “Kill ‘em All” in 1983 and “Ride the Lightning” in 1984.Megaforce also released the first albums by Anthrax (“Fistful of Metal,” 1984), Testament (“The Legacy,” 1987) and others.Heavy metal was just beginning to take hold in the United States when the Zazulas became involved, and it was sometimes dismissed as mere noise. But in a 1983 interview with The Courier-News of Bridgewater, N.J., Mr. Zazula explained the attraction.“It’s music that’s pure emotion,” he said. “Heavy metal is super-talent at breakneck speed.”The music, he said, was destined to endure.“New wave music changes every week,” he said. “Metal gives the people something they can count on.”ImageJon and Marsha Zazula backstage at a Monsters of Rock concert in about 1990.Credit...Gene AmboJonathan David Zazula was born on March 16, 1952, in the Bronx. His father, Norman, was a shipping clerk, and his mother, Helen (Risch) Zazula, was recreation director at a nursing home.He grew up in the Eastchester Gardens complex in the Bronx and attended Lehman College. He married Lisa Weber in 1972, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1979 he married Marsha Jean Rutenberg.He was working in financial planning and she in marketing when they left New York in 1980 and settled in Old Bridge, N.J. His finance career came to an end the next year when the company he worked for, which traded in metals, was raided by the authorities and everyone there was charged with fraud, accused of passing off scrap metal as the rare metal tantalum. Mr. Zazula served six months in a halfway house in Newark, and he and his wife began selling at the flea market during that time to try to make ends meet.“That’s how we started Rock N Roll Heaven,” he said in an interview for “Moguls and Madmen: The Pursuit of Power in Popular Music,” a 1994 book by Jory Farr. “Out of that pit of hell came all that we did.”Their fledgling concert-promotion business — Crazed Management was their company’s name — was very hands-on; they personally plastered telephone poles with fliers, and band members often crashed at their house.“I remember we had to sell every club we worked in on the idea of presenting an original heavy-metal show,” Mr. Zazula, recalling the early years, told The Home News of New Brunswick, N.J., in 1988. “In those days all the clubs wanted cover bands.”Creating Megaforce Records, he said, was a fallback, after the couple had made some more demos with Metallica and tried to interest existing labels.“They thought we were crazy,” he told The Courier-News in 1987. “‘What kind of music is this?’ And we were forced to start our own record company to promote Metallica.”Bands given their start by Megaforce tended to move to more mainstream labels once they made it big; after its first two albums, Metallica signed with Elektra.The couple sold their stake in Megaforce in 2001, although Mr. Zazula continued to promote an occasional concert until retiring in 2018.Mr. Zazula is survived by three daughters, Danielle Zazula, Rikki Zazula and Blaire Zazula Brewer; two brothers, Evan and Robert; and five grandchildren.";2022-02-04;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/arts/jon-zazula-dead.html;2022-02-05;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESJONZAZULA,EARLYPROMOTEROFHEAVYMETAL,DIESAT69
The New York Times;Omicron Dented Tourism Just as Visitors Were Starting to Return;After an end-of-year drop-off, 1.7 million fewer tourists than expected came to New York City last year.;Good morning. It’s Friday. We’ll look at how the Omicron variant affected tourism in New York at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. And we’ll see why Thursday was a momentous day for Letitia James, the state attorney general.Also, so you know: I’m taking a staycation next week. Corey Kilgannon will be here.ImageCredit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesThe highly contagious Omicron variant sent coronavirus case counts soaring to new highs in New York in December and January. Another measure of Omicron’s impact became clear on Thursday: The variant dragged down tourism in New York City just as visitors were returning in significant numbers.The hit from Omicron amounted to 1.7 million visitors, according to officials of NYC & Company, the city’s tourism agency.That was the difference between the forecast for 2021 that it had issued in October — 34.6 million visitors — and the total of 32.9 million visitors that it has now calculated actually arrived. Officials of NYC & Company chalked up most of the drop to a weaker than expected December, when Omicron made tourists rethink their travel plans.The total for last year was slightly less than half the 66.6 million visitors in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic. But it was 47 percent more than the number NYC & Company reported for 2020, when New York was the epicenter in the early stages of the pandemic, and officials ordered a broad economic shutdown to curb the spread of the virus.Omicron also kept visitors away in early January, prompting NYC & Company to scale down its projection for 2022. The agency now expects 56.5 million tourists this year, 1.3 million fewer than it had predicted previously. Still, Fred Dixon, the president of NYC & Company, pointed to rising hotel occupancy figures that indicated that New York remained the nation’s most desirable destination. Nearly 82 percent of the city’s hotel rooms were occupied during the week that ended Dec. 11, according to the travel research company STR. And revenue per available room jumped nearly 500 percent in December, compared with the same month in 2020, according to a report to be issued next week by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.But once Omicron hit, occupancy rates plunged as low as 40 percent during the week that ended on Jan. 15. They began to rise as Omicron receded.“If you want some good news, it is that tourists or leisure travelers are returning pretty much in force,” said Sean Hennessey, a professor at New York University, “and amazingly enough, they are in many cases willing to pay more for a night’s room than they were prior to Covid. But the return to the office has gone slowly, and that has dampened expectations of a robust rebound in corporate travel.”The hotel occupancy rates may reflect a change in the mind-set of travelers. “People are recognizing this virus is here to stay,” Dixon said, and are “ready to get on with their lives.”WeatherExpect strong winds and a chance of showers in the morning. The evening is mostly clear, with temps dropping to the high 20s.alternate-side parkingIn effect until Monday (Washington’s Birthday).A momentous day for the state attorney generalLetitia James, the state attorney general, scored a major victory in her investigation of former President Donald Trump and his company: A judge said she and her team could question him and two of his children.Lawyers for the Trumps had charged that Ms. James was politically biased and was using her investigation to help a criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which she is also participating in. But the judge, Justice Arthur Engoron of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, declared that “this argument completely misses the mark.”The decision came hours after James accepted the Democratic nomination for another term as attorney general. In an 18-minute speech, she did not discuss her campaign for governor, which she announced in October and called off weeks later. (She said then that she wanted to continue the work she was doing. By dropping out of the race, she solidified Gov. Kathy Hochul’s place as the front-runner.)She mentioned — but only briefly — Trump and another former official with whom she has tangled, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has blamed her for his resignation. James oversaw an investigation that found that Cuomo had sexually harassed a number of women — claims he has steadfastly denied.“It has become clear the former governor will never accept any version of these events other than his own,” she said. “And to achieve that, he is now claiming the mantle of victim, disgracefully attacking anyone in his path, pushing others down in order to prop himself up, but I will not bow. I will not break.”She then mentioned both adversaries in the same sentence: “I will not be bullied by him or Donald Trump.”The latest New York newsFormer Gov.

She is 89.The music historian Brigid Cohen reached out to her more than a decade ago for a book about cultural crosscurrents in the Cold War years of the 1950s and early 1960s. “Yoko Ono replied once and only once: to an inquiring letter I mailed in 2008, she responded with an overnight FedEx package containing photocopies of her own archival materials,” Cohen wrote in “Musical Migration and Imperial New York,” which will be published in April. “Follow-up inquiries, which focused more extensively on herself and her work, went unanswered.”Cohen wrote that she figured the lack of response reflected “the justifiable need of celebrity for protective silence, especially given Ono’s own experiences of gendered and racialized exploitation in the media.”But Cohen amassed enough material to recount Ono’s work as an avant-gardist in New York years before John Lennon of the Beatles encountered her work — and her. One milestone that Cohen described was a recital in 1961 at what was then known as Carnegie Recital Hall that involved a performance of “AOS — To David Tudor.” (He composed and performed electronic music.)“She described it as an opera, but it didn’t have any music as we conventionally think of it,” Cohen said in an interview this week. “It culminated in the end with Ono doing a screaming performance. She screams like no other person.”Has she screamed for Cohen? “Not personally,” Cohen said. “I have heard recordings. She makes a real art of it.”What we’re readingFor almost a decade, the unofficial honor of closing New York Fashion Week went to Marc Jacobs.

My companion on the trip was Lee Lubbers, a sculptor and Jesuit priest at Creighton University.His medium at the time was recycled railroad boxcar axles. He heated them in a huge oven belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad and then, using a giant hydraulic anvil, forged them into modern steel menhir that weighed three-quarters of a ton and were about 11½ feet tall.We were assured twice before leaving for New York that the gallery had a 12-foot ceiling.After arriving on a cold, gray afternoon, we unloaded the first of the sculptures and tried to erect it, only to discover the gallery’s 12-foot ceiling had apparently shrunk to about 11 feet.We retreated to a nearby shop to discuss our options over coffee. There was only one other person, a woman, there, and she clearly had not been served yet. She sat at a small table, seemingly unable to get the attention of the man who served us.After continuing to ignore her for a while, he finally looked at her.“What’s wrong with you?” he said in an annoyed tone.“I’m not feeling well,” the woman replied.“When you’re not feeling well,” he said after a pause, “you go to the doctor, not to the deli.”“I just came from the doctor,” she said.“What did the doctor say?”“He said go down to the deli and get yourself a cup of tea.”— Michael M.

The New York Times;The Best of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour Openers;Listen to songs by Muna, beabadoobee, Gracie Abrams and more.;"ImageImageThe pop trio Muna brought a surprise to Coachella last weekend. (It wasn’t Taylor Swift.)Credit...Tonje Thilesen for The New York TimesBy Lindsay ZoladzDear listeners,Perhaps you have heard that Taylor Swift is currently on tour.I kid. Of course you have heard about the Eras Tour — the record-setting cultural juggernaut that nearly took down Ticketmaster. The concerts started in March, but Eras Tour fever shows no sign of abating. Fans are getting married in the front rows. Entire cities have been temporarily renamed in Swift’s honor. People are camping out overnight just to buy merch. A lavender haze has officially descended upon the nation.For today’s playlist, though, let’s focus on a less discussed aspect of this tour: the strength, variety and occasional surprises of Swift’s opening acts.Nine artists will be accompanying Swift throughout all the stops of the tour, two playing per night, which gives each performance a bit of novelty and, occasionally, some fun regional specificity. (Haim, those darlings of the San Fernando Valley, are only doing West Coast dates.) The bill is a mix of obvious choices (Haim and Phoebe Bridgers, both Swift collaborators) and unexpected co-signs (the cult-favorite pop group Muna and up-and-coming indie-rocker beabadoobee are welcome surprises). Others, like the Gen-Z singer-songwriters Gracie Abrams and girl in red, represent Swift’s artistic progeny; both have cited Swift’s music as formative influences on their own and share her sharp eye for emotional detail.This playlist culls some of the best songs by my favorite of the artists opening for Swift — and one song that features a cameo from Swift herself. Her tour also includes the teen phenom Gayle (whose viral hit “Abcdefu” you have most likely heard already) and Christian Owens, a former Swift backup dancer who has released a handful of songs under the name Owenn.Even if you’re not much of a Swiftie, this playlist conveniently doubles as both an exploration of the influence that ’90s pop-rock has had on a younger generation of artists, and as a fun, breezy soundtrack for the first warm days of the year. I field-tested it on a long walk in the middle of this gorgeous week in New York for that purpose and found it highly appropriate.Also: Thanks for all your submissions suggesting your favorite workout song! I’ll be publishing some of them in Tuesday’s newsletter. If you still have one you’d like to recommend, you can submit it here.Listen along here on Spotify as you read.1. Haim: “The Steps”Is this song the clearest distillation of Sheryl Crow’s effect on millennial musicians? Is it the best song on Haim’s sprawling and fantastic 2020 album “Women in Music Part III”? How awesome was Haim’s performance of this song at the 2021 Grammys? I am up for debating any and all of these questions. (Listen on YouTube)2. beabadoobee: “Care”There are some excellent songs on “Beatopia,” the most recent release from the Filipino-British singer-songwriter beabadoobee, but this great single from 2020 is the one that first made me a fan. Even though she was born in 2000, “Care” shows how intuitively she understands something about the sort of scuzzy, anthemic indie-pop that underground labels like Slumberland Records were releasing in the ’90s. (A “Best of Slumberland Records” playlist in a future installment of The Amplifier? Now there’s an idea.) (Listen on YouTube)3. Muna featuring Phoebe Bridgers: “Silk Chiffon”Two Eras Tour openers for the price of one! Far and away my favorite song from Muna’s 2022 self-titled album, this one is pure pop bliss and a refreshing reverie of queer joy. (When the group played it last weekend at Coachella, it surprised the crowd by bringing out not just Bridgers, but also the other two members of the supergroup boygenius, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker.) (Listen on YouTube)4. Paramore: “Crave”Here’s an underappreciated highlight from Paramore’s latest album, “This Is Why.” Hayley Williams’s vocals on the chorus give me some serious Alanis Morissette vibes. (Listen on YouTube)5. Gracie Abrams: “Best”I like the dramatic pause Gracie Abrams takes toward the end of this line: “You fell hard, I thought good … riddance.” I also always appreciate a heartbreak song on which the singer takes responsibility for doing the heartbreaking. “Best” is the opening track on Abrams’s 2023 debut studio album, “Good Riddance,” on which she worked with one of Swift’s “Folklore”-era collaborators, the musician and producer Aaron Dessner. (Listen on YouTube)6. girl in red: “I’ll Call You Mine”In the years since she started posting songs online as a teenager, the Norwegian singer-songwriter Marie Ulven Ringheim, now 24, has built a devoted fan base that hangs on her every angsty, sharply observed word. When Swift told her Instagram followers she had the girl in red album “If I Could Make It Go Quiet” “on repeat” in 2021, this was the track she was listening to. (Listen on YouTube)7. Phoebe Bridgers: “Chinese Satellite”Bridgers’s “Punisher,” released in June 2020, will always be one of the albums that defined the surreal loneliness of that first pandemic summer for me. Over the years I’ve cycled through several different favorite tracks — first “Moon Song,” then “Garden Song” — but if you asked me today I’d say it’s “Chinese Satellite.” The moment when Bridgers’s wry numbness suddenly gives way to a rush of earnestness when she sings, “I’d stand on the corner, embarrassed with a picket sign, if it meant I would see you when I die” never fails to give me chills. (Listen on YouTube)8. Haim featuring Taylor Swift: “Gasoline”Is “The Steps” the best song on “Women in Music Part III”? The twist ending to this playlist is that I think it may actually be “Gasoline.” And I get the sense that Swift agrees with me, given the conviction she brings to her guest verse on this remix.

Make sure you get to the kicker at the very end.Speaking of fascinating-but-depressing reporting, I also appreciate this recent essay in Vulture, in which the writer Nate Jones asks, “Why Are My Secret Spotify Songs Following Me Around?” Jones puts a finger on the precise sort of algorithmic dependency I want to combat with this newsletter in favor of more personal forms of music discovery. Jones writes, “When you love a song, you feel a sense of ownership; it can become a marker of your personal taste in a way that feels private and individual, a feeling ‘Discover Weekly’ is designed to encourage.

The New York Times;Frank Ocean Shows Us a More Human Way to Perform;As live concert broadcasts have grown increasingly staid, his electrifying Coachella set gave us an unruly digital experience to share.;"Frank Ocean was constructing an ice-skating rink in the Sonoran desert. This was his reported plan — to headline the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on the night of April 16 inside, or in front of, or atop a frozen pool, defying the basic logic of weather. What better metaphor could there be for an artist seemingly allergic to the typical mechanisms of the music industry than to accept the headlining slot at Coachella and then subvert it, to stage the opposite of the festival’s arid environment by scheming an icy exhibition among the sickening dust and heat? The rumored set design was ultimately scrapped, but the very concept of Ocean’s doomed ice rink felt symbolic — maybe of how distant this king of pop-world disenchantment felt from Coachella’s surroundings to begin with.I was not in the desert. Nor did I really believe that I would be able to watch Ocean’s set — his first major public performance since 2017 — on an officially sanctioned livestream. Before he came onstage, YouTube clarified that Ocean’s 10:05 p.m. Pacific Standard Time set would not be broadcast on Coachella’s own stream — his representatives say he was, in fact, never scheduled to appear on the stream — though this was not surprising. Enigma has always been a tenet of Ocean’s public persona. Having previously spurned the Grammy Awards, dismissed major record labels and called attention to the very nature of livestreaming with his 2016 visual album, “Endless,” Ocean was primed to opt out without apology.It did not stop fans; links to spontaneous Instagram Live streams, by those on the ground, abounded. As it approached 1:05 a.m. in New York, I opened one of these links on my desktop and sat for an hour, waiting. Tens of thousands of us clicked on and waited. It was democratizing — there are no V.I.P. sections that I know of on Instagram Live — and the rumor was that Lorde was waiting in the same stream, too. We were all in it, waiting in the Frank Ocean IG Live, together.When the music finally started, this particular improvised stream proved to be shaky — while the set quickly revealed itself to be an unconventional, at-times rough-hewed spectacle — cutting in and out as Ocean sang a rock version of “Novacane,” his 2011 breakthrough single about emotionless sex and a couple who meet at Coachella. Fortunately, I soon found @Morgandoesntcare, a young musician from North Carolina who facilitated the guerrilla video stream that brought Ocean’s set to the masses, reaching 130,000 viewers. Ocean’s absence from the official stream felt like a refusal of that frictionless status quo. Maybe Ocean said no to the sanctioned livestream because he knew his set wouldn’t be what he “intended to show,” as he acknowledged in a statement later that week. (According to that statement, he sustained a leg injury in the days before Coachella, requiring a rework of the show.) Maybe the choice was intuitive. It’s enticing, however, to wonder if he made the decision in order to reject our on-demand culture of convenience. Some industry prognosticators have wondered if livestreams could supplant in-person concerts in the future — though it doesn’t seem likely — as ticket prices surge at the hands of exploitative corporations and make large-scale concertgoing increasingly unattainable to anyone but the rich. Livestreamed concerts by mainstream artists are often more like note-by-note recitals. With streaming more broadly, the data-driven music companies want to find patterns, to engineer us further into a culture of predictability. Intentionally or not, Ocean’s absence from the official stream felt like a refusal of that frictionless status quo. Watching a teenager’s ad hoc broadcast instead made for a more unruly digital experience that could not be predicted, planned for, optimized or controlled.The day after Ocean’s set, it still consumed my thoughts. Though I had watched it on a trembly hand-held broadcast that cut in and out, I felt that I had not only witnessed but participated in something significant — not in spite of but because of the spontaneous stream. Most reviews disagreed, criticizing how Ocean stoked “confusion” and commenting that his songs didn’t sound the way they do on his records. When I watched alone in my bedroom more than 2,000 miles away, these qualities made the music feel alive. Liveness has always carried with it an expectation of, and invitation into, risk and imperfection. But the media landscape’s flood of manicured concert-film and livestream events has largely normalized staid, smooth performances, a trend that mirrors the streaming era’s broader preference for formulaic culture. Lauryn Hill’s commitment was to presenting the truest version of herself, not appealing to commercial interests.Ocean’s set seemed like a rebuke of this trend. New arrangements of his most beloved songs, like “Bad Religion” and “White Ferrari,” sounded more astral and expansive than ever. “Solo” approached something resembling starry electric jazz and nearly brought me to tears. The speech Ocean gave about his younger brother, who died in a car accident in 2020 and with whom he went to Coachella multiple times, immediately did. The songs sometimes showed their seams, letting his voice reach higher and skate the sky. Delicate acoustic takes of “Pink + White” and “Self Control” brought to mind the intimacy of a theoretical Ocean appearance on “MTV Unplugged.”Pop music history is filled with incidents in which celebrated artists polarized their audiences from big stages, but one important precedent is Lauryn Hill’s 2001 performance on “MTV Unplugged.” On that show, and the unvarnished album that followed the next year, “MTV Unplugged No. 2.0,” she sang her biblical hip-hop folk profundities in a gorgeous raspy voice, accompanied by her acoustic guitar. In between songs, she delivered monologues of uncompromising creative wisdom. At the time, this live session was considered bewildering and met with divided reviews. Hill’s commitment was to presenting the truest version of herself, not appealing to commercial interests. “Fantasy is what people want,” Hill said then, “but reality is what they need.”You can imagine the now-35-year-old Ocean growing up, absorbing Hill’s messaging and reflecting his own unpolished reality in concert. When he played Coachella in 2012, he covered “Tell Him” from “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” Ocean has a documented fondness for her “Unplugged” performance: His song “Rushes,” from “Endless,” interpolates Hill’s “Just Like Water”; he once rapped over a sample of “I Gotta Find Peace of Mind,” a track on which Hill cries. “What I am is what I am, and I can’t be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public,” Hill said during the “MTV Unplugged” performance. She defended her right to let her voice crack, which was a reflection of her lived experience. Such honesty calls people to be artists. But contemporary streaming culture, and the rigid aesthetic standards it widely supports, are hostile to frayed edges.On the spontaneous Ocean Instagram stream, I caught glory in flickers. Ocean’s set, which he himself called “chaotic” while emphasizing the “beauty in chaos,” was a presentation of his own humanity. In a just popular culture, that is what a “live” album, “live” stream, “live” concert and “live” artist is: raw, fallible and human.Source photographs: Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse, via Getty Images; Getty Images; Timothy Hearsum/The Image Bank/Getty Images.Jenn Pelly is a freelance writer, contributing editor at Pitchfork and author of “The Raincoats.”";2023-05-09;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/magazine/frank-ocean-coachella.html;2023-05-10;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESFRANKOCEANSHOWSUSAMOREHUMANWAYTOPERFORM
The New York Times;Finding New Meaning in Timeless Music;A new wave of artists is turning African music into a force that honors the past and transcends borders.;"This personal reflection is part of a series called Turning Points, in which writers explore what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. You can read more by visiting the Turning Points series page.Turning Point: In April, Burna Boy, the Grammy award-winning singer, became the first artist from Nigeria to headline and sell out a show at Madison Square Garden in New York.Music links so many forms of life on this planet — from the songs of birds, the chirping of crickets and the wailing of whales to the babbling brook and the rustling of leaves. It is the cornerstone of memories for so many of us, me included. Childhood, adulthood; good times, bad times.When I was a young girl growing up in Benin in the ’60s, music was all around us. Traditional musicians taught us beautiful songs about my country’s stories and legends. Our culture was mainly oral, so many people knew hundreds of songs and proverbs by heart, all sung over very intricate rhythms. But, contrary to popular belief, that music is not set in stone. Though some of the melodies have endured for centuries, songs and folklore evolve constantly as they travel and adapt to the times. That is what makes them timeless.A few years ago, for example, I was in Salvador, Brazil, and witnessed a Candomblé ceremony where descendants of enslaved people were singing Yoruba religious songs. To my surprise, I recognized some of these. They had survived for hundreds of years and now resonated with new meaning.ImageThe artist Burna Boy in his studio in Lagos, Nigeria last year.Credit...Temilade Adelaja/ReutersOn the surface, it seems like the world is changing fast, and not always for the better. There is division everywhere, and modern technology has cut our attention span. Gone are the days of eight-minute songs with endless solos. Now, many songs are two and a half minutes, or shorter — just enough time to fit on a reel. Every week thousands of songs are released. Some of them go viral, creating new trends and styles that go out of fashion just as quickly.It may all seem different and overwhelming, but at the core of it, we’ve been searching for the same thing all along, and we still are. We are always looking for that new thing, that something that feels both fresh and familiar at the same time. Something that ignites that feeling of excitement and that feels like an unforgettable memory in the making. Considered from this angle, all the newness in the world — and in music — isn’t bad. It’s a way to have more: more music, more memory, more connection all over the globe — a more resonant and meaningful way of expressing ourselves.African music, in particular, is benefiting from such rapid evolution, to the point where it feels like it’s conquering the world. When they were first starting out, artists such as Yemi Alade, Wizkid, CKay and Fireboy DML used new technology to produce sophisticated music without depending on big money from major labels. Streaming platforms have made it easier to reach an audience, to touch people directly.Working with this generation of African artists inspires me, because the way their music feels and makes me feel is that perfect blend of familiar and fresh. Young artists like Burna Boy, the first Nigerian act to headline — and sell out — Madison Square Garden, are shining on the world stage because they are no longer looking to imitate Western music. They are looking to the traditional music of their countries, and to the many artists who came before them, like Fela Kuti, Salif Keita or me.They are following the advice I often give, which is: The world doesn’t need another Jay-Z — we already have one. Traditional music in Africa is so rich in incredible rhythms. You have to use that treasure the same way Chopin, Gershwin and Bartok were inspired by the folk songs of their home countries.ImageA scene from the musical ""Fela!"" at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in New York in 2009.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesNow the freedom and energy that have always made up the backbone of traditional African music are being translated, transported and enjoyed all over the world. The rhythm of Afrobeats — that mix of the African clave that meets dancehall, Latin and dance music — is entering the mainstream. Those drums convey the power and warmth that are the heartbeat of Africa. They echo in our common DNA because we are all descendants of Africa, and the image of the continent is changing to reflect that.How far have we come from enslaved people singing in secret, the folk songs of Indigenous populations all over the world being stamped out? These new artists’ popularity is the first sign of a profound change in how the African continent is perceived — for the ways in which our people, in all their different ways and different cultures, are claiming a new, broader influence.A specific song can be a turning point in a life — I know hearing Miriam Makeba’s “Pata Pata” was that for me. It had an uplifting feeling that sent you to a place of community and belonging, even if you didn’t understand the lyrics. The musical change we’re seeing today, alongside the technological advances making it possible, is creating a shift of global proportion. African music is no longer hidden behind the mainstream genres it has influenced, such as blues, jazz and rock. It’s now a mainstream force of its own, shining in plain sight, and I hope that it signals a change in how Africa as a whole is seen and treated as people see their shared roots reflected in it.If people everywhere are dancing to Afrobeats, no matter who they are and how they look, then maybe we all have more in common than we’ve been led to believe. After all, these rhythms — of music, of humanity, of memory — are cyclical. They cannot be forgotten, because they are deeper and stronger than words. Music is embodied memory, transcending time and frontiers, keeping a record of both who we are and how we have changed.Angélique Kidjo is a five-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.";2022-12-01;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/special-series/burna-boy-afrobeats-global-hits.html;2022-12-04;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESFINDINGNEWMEANINGINTIMELESSMUSIC
The New York Times;For Grammy Nominee Rogét Chahayed, Pop Isn’t Far From Mozart;Up for producer of the year, non-classical, on Sunday, a conservatory-trained collaborator focuses on “finding the simplicity, finding that golden chord progression.”;"Two very different kinds of education went into the music that has brought Rogét Chahayed a 2022 Grammy nomination for producer of the year, non-classical. One was traditional music school: the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where Chahayed studied classical music and jazz and earned a degree in piano performance. The second was a studio apprenticeship of late nights and split-second decisions: playing keyboards and building beats for the Los Angeles hip-hop mogul Dr. Dre.“The real me is a blend of classical music, jazz harmony and technique, everything together,” Chahayed said, speaking via video from his home studio in Los Angeles, where rows of electronic keyboards filled a wall of shelves, “So you’ll hear the voicings of Debussy and Ravel and stuff like that, that I really love, in my left hand, but maybe in the right hand I might be trying some Art Tatum. I love to try and see the connection between everything.”Chahayed’s huge catalog includes Doja Cat’s “Kiss Me More”; Jessie Reyez’s “Far Away”; Halsey’s “Bad at Love”; Big Sean’s “ZTFO”; Miguel’s “Sky Walker”; Kali Uchis’s “I Want War (But I Need Peace)”; Nas’s “27 Summers”; and two Grammy-nominated songs from previous years, Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” and Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode.” His nomination on Sunday is for songs with Kali Uchis, Doja Cat and Anderson .Paak, among others.Chahayed’s studio work draws on a store of music theory and music history along with instinct, attentiveness and luck. As a producer and songwriter, he can assemble complex harmonies and subtle multitracked orchestrations, reflecting his conservatory studies.But Chahayed can also come up with skeletal, arresting, earworm riffs that he often enriches, spatially and harmonically, as a track unfolds. He doesn’t mind repeating just two or three chords. “A lot of my composer and classical instrumentalist friends might look at that as like, ‘Oh, it’s so simple,’” he said. “Actually, producing music today reminds me a lot about the way Mozart would compose. Obviously a lot of Mozart’s music is very simple and very digestible, and it’s so open that if you make a mistake, you can hear everything. The difficulty is finding the simplicity, finding that golden chord progression.”Chahayed adeptly navigates the way songs are made in the 21st century: a process that’s at once musicianly, technological, intuitive and brutally Darwinist. Hooks and beats that were recorded in a few moments can sit for months on a hard drive, to be discovered, tweaked and augmented by collaborators who have never met. All that matters is whether someone hears that a track has potential, wants to finish it and finds something that works.Image“I enjoy working with the artists who let me cook from scratch,” Chahayed said.Credit...Michael Tyrone Delaney for The New York Times“If I have a philosophy, it’s that I want to be able to execute the vision of the artist first,” Chahayed said. “But also to do it in a way that’s innovative, that’s always finding a way to push the boundaries sonically.”The Colombian American songwriter Kali Uchis has only released a few tracks with Chahayed’s production — including “Aguardiente y Limón,” cited in his Grammy nomination — but they live near each other in Los Angeles, and she often visits his studio to work on music.A Guide to the 2022 Grammy AwardsThe ceremony, originally scheduled for Jan. 31, was postponed for a second year in a row due to Covid and is now scheduled for April 3.Jon Batiste Leads the Way: The jazz pianist earned the most nominations with 11, including album and record of the year.

If it so happens to end up being a big song, then great. But with me and Rogét, I’ve never gotten in the studio and felt any weird pressure to go in any direction. It was alway very organic, very natural and very, just, free.”After graduating from the conservatory in 2010, Chahayed moved back to Los Angeles, where he grew up; his mother is from Argentina, his father from Syria. He played jazz and chamber-music gigs and taught piano lessons; he also found a mentor: Melvin Bradford, better known as Mel-Man, one of Dr. Dre’s main producers since the 1990s.“I’d go to his house and make five to eight beats per day. From 1 p.m. all the way to sometimes 2, 3 or 4 in the morning,” he said. “We would send countless beats to Dre every day, just in hopes that maybe something would click.”He added, “It was definitely a big difference from sitting in a class learning about Bach chorales or ear training.”Chahayed also collaborated with others, including the producer Wesley Singerman. In 2013, they sold outright some tracks they had made; their music turned up, uncredited, on Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 album “To Pimp a Butterfly” in “For Sale?” and “U.”In 2014, Mel-Man surprised Chahayed one day by taking him to an unmarked building. It was Dr. Dre’s studio. “This door opens, and I just see a giant S.S.L. and Dre is sitting there turning knobs with his hands,” Chahayed said, referring to a Solid State Logic recording console. “He told me that he heard I was nice on the keys and he was going to put me to the test.”He passed muster and started working on Dre’s productions. “You have a responsibility to be the best you can be all the time and constantly portray musical excellence: technique, taste, flavor, rhythm,” he said. “I’ve had Dre right there, standing over everybody saying, ‘Hey, what you got?’ And when you have the biggest, most influential producer and rapper in the world telling you that, you’ve got to act.”One of Chahayed’s first blockbuster hits was “Broccoli” by Dram (who now goes by Shelley FKA Dram), featuring Lil Yachty, which has been streamed more than a billion times. Its steady-plinking piano chords, Chahayed said, were a happy accident. He had packed up his equipment after a session with Dram, only to receive a last-minute call that Lil Yachty was on his way to the studio. He unpacked and plugged in a keyboard, playing a few chords to test the connection; those chords became the song’s central loop.ImageOne of Chahayed’s first huge hits was “Broccoli” by Dram (who now goes by Shelley FKA Dram), featuring Lil Yachty.Credit...Michael Tyrone Delaney for The New York Times“Where and how I find most of my success as a producer and songwriter is, you know, just showing up,” Chahayed said. “Finding a sound and coming up with the progression, or a riff, or something identifiable that catches people’s attention.”“Kiss Me More,” the hit by Doja Cat featuring SZA that is nominated for record of the year (the recorded track), song of the year (the composition) and as part of album of the year, could have ended up as one more stray computer file. Chahayed was working with Yeti Beats, Doja Cat’s longtime executive producer, at what he called “a beat cook-up session.” Yeti Beats suggested some “keywords” — “anime music” and “cuteness” — with Doja Cat in mind.“I grew up with four younger sisters, and we all bonded a lot over anime and video game stuff,” Chahayed said. “This cute jazzy vibe from a lot of games kind of seeped in. So I tapped back into that realm that specific day, and we made a few ideas.”He chose a guitar-like sound and recorded a twinkly little riff that “just kind of came naturally in the moment,” he said. “I knew there was something special about that track.” Yeti Beats repeatedly presented the riff to Doja Cat, and at one session, he sped it up; it clicked.As Chahayed’s reputation has grown, so has his control over his music. He sometimes turns down requests to use his beats for particular songs. And, whenever possible, he tries to work alongside the main artist in real time.“For most people, a general procedure is have tons of beats and melodies and ideas and things of that sort ready. A lot of artists have a different kind of attention span, and maybe react better to things that are ready-made. But I’ve adapted more to the spontaneity of just showing up with the instruments. I enjoy working with the artists who let me cook from scratch.”He’s also looking ahead. “I always have a five-to-10-year plan,” he said. “Thankfully, I have been able to hit my last five-year goal: You know, get No. 1s, get Grammy nominated, accumulate tons of record sales and charting stuff. And it’s cool, but it only fuels me to go further. My real passion is that I want to score movies. I want to do what John Williams, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer and Bernard Herrmann do. Those guys are my true heroes.”He added, “I’ll never stop producing. I’ll never stop making beats. I’ll never stop working with artists. But I would love it if you’re watching a movie and seeing ‘Music by Rogét Chahayed.’ That’s my obsession.”";2022-03-30;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/arts/music/roget-chahayed-producer-grammys.html;2022-03-30;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESFORGRAMMYNOMINEEROGéTCHAHAYED,POPISN’TFARFROMMOZART
The New York Times;Sony Music Buys Bob Dylan’s Recorded Music;The transaction for Dylan’s albums was made in July, about seven months after he made another deal — with Sony’s rival Universal Music — for his songwriting copyrights.;Sony Music has acquired the entire recorded music catalog of Bob Dylan, including all his previous albums and “the rights to multiple future releases,” the company announced on Monday.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to a calculation by Billboard, the music trade publication, the rights to Dylan’s recordings may be worth about $200 million, based on an estimate of $16 million in annual revenue around the world.When Dylan sold his songwriting rights — which are separate from those for recordings — to Universal Music in late 2020, that deal was estimated to be worth well over $300 million.In Dylan’s case, his songwriting corpus is so valuable because of the thousands of cover versions of his songs that have been made over the years — from Peter, Paul & Mary in the 1960s to Adele, who recorded Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love” on her first album.Dylan’s history with Columbia Records, which is owned by Sony, goes back more than 60 years. He was signed to the label in 1961, by its famed talent scout John Hammond, and Columbia released Dylan’s self-titled first album the following year, which included traditional folk songs and a handful of Dylan originals like “Talkin’ New York” and “Song to Woody,” a tribute to his hero Woody Guthrie.“Columbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records,” Dylan said in a statement. Stringer is the chief executive of Sony Music and the former head of Columbia.“I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong,” Dylan added.Dylan, 80, sold the rights to his own master recordings, which he had long controlled, to Sony. According to Sony’s announcement, the transaction was concluded in July, making it one of the music industry’s rare big-money deals to avoid leaks for as much as six months.The deal is part of a wave of transactions for artists’ catalogs, which have included Sony’s $550 million purchase of Bruce Springsteen’s recorded music and songwriting catalogs, as well as other major deals for the work of Paul Simon, Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner, Neil Young, Shakira and others.The copyrights for recordings and songwriting — the lyrics and melodies underlying the recording of any songs — are separate, and both have been coveted by investors in recent years as streaming has lifted the music industry’s fortunes.The Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, Okla., housing Dylan’s vast archives, is set to open in May.;2022-01-24;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/arts/music/bob-dylan-sony-recordings.html;2022-01-29;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESSONYMUSICBUYSBOBDYLAN’SRECORDEDMUSIC
The New York Times;Harry Styles Is Still a Dreamy Cipher on His Third LP, ‘Harry’s House’;The title of the pop star’s latest album suggests open-door intimacy, but instead pairs more vivid sonic landscapes with less revealing lyrics.;"On “Harry’s House,” the third solo album from the colossally charismatic former member of the British boy band One Direction, 28-year-old Harry Styles often sings from a perspective that is a combination of a prematurely wise elder, a personal cheerleader and a pro bono therapist.“You can throw a party full of everyone you know and not invite your family, ’cause they never showed you love,” he sings on the acoustic ballad “Matilda,” a tender character study addressing a woman who carries the burden of past traumas — at least until the narrator gives her permission to lay them down. “Boyfriends,” he croons later on a song of the same name, “They take you for granted, they don’t know that they’re just misunderstanding you.” That song, which features some agile fingerpicking by the singer-songwriter Ben Harper, regards its male specimen from a bemused distance, as if it is a category of mere mortal from which someone as empathic as Styles is automatically exempt.While “Harry’s House” is more sonically adventurous and eclectically influenced than most of the music Styles made with One Direction — the title itself is an obscure nod to the Japanese singer-songwriter Haruomi Hosono’s 1973 album “Hosono House” — it shares his former group’s sense of generosity and devotion to the female subject and, by extension, listener. As the journalist Kaitlyn Tiffany writes in her forthcoming and highly entertaining book “Everything I Need I Get From You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It,” One Direction was “a group of boys whose commercial proposition is that they would never hurt you.”When Styles — who was active in 1D from age 16 to 24 — branched out on his own, his most successful songs paid more mature but still unselfish tribute to women. The beachy hit “Watermelon Sugar,” from his 2019 album “Fine Line,” was a winkingly euphemistic but sensually serious ode to giving female pleasure. Another swoony highlight from that record was called, even more succinctly, “Adore You.”Such devotion to the feminine certainly makes Styles’s music go down smoother than the many pop songs pockmarked with outright misogyny. But this other-oriented perspective has also made Styles himself feel, on his records, like something of a cipher. This problem was less apparent on the superior “Fine Line,” which partially chronicled a breakup and allowed space for Styles to wallow, transgress and occasionally get a revealing jab in at his ex’s new partner (“Does he take you walking round his parents’ gallery?”). Despite the open-door intimacy suggested by its title, “Harry’s House” doesn’t have much in the way of furniture.It is certainly the most distinct-sounding album Styles has made yet, and his production team of Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson (with whom Styles has worked closely on all his solo albums) concoct some vivid sonic landscapes. The album opens with the bright and playful “Music for a Sushi Restaurant,” replete with horns, a gummy bass line and surprising bursts of stacked vocals. The dreamy “Daylight” has a psychedelic weightlessness and sudden crunches of electric guitar that recall Tame Impala, while the highlight “Grapejuice” frames a spryly ascending melody with a kind of jaunty piano and compressed vocal effect reminiscent of “Ram”-era Paul McCartney. Styles’s voice is sleek and nimble throughout, favoring a looser delivery — he actually scats on one song — than the flashy, belt-it-out pyrotechnics of his boy band days.There is something sky-like about the whole album, and its 41 minutes unfurl with an air of pleasantly stoned contentment, occasionally overcast by some gentle melancholy that passes like a fleeting cloud. Styles’s current hit single “As It Was” is the closest he comes to sounding genuinely troubled, and part of what makes that song work is the tension between his muttered, slumped-shouldered vocals and the synth hook’s sprightly urgings to carry on.The wedding-band funk of “Daydreaming” and the lyrically inane “Cinema” feel comparatively frictionless, and display Styles’s unfortunate tendency to write lyrics that feel more like precisely posed Instagram carousels than conjurings of specific emotional states. “Black-and-white film camera/Yellow sunglasses/Ashtray/Swimming pool,” he sings on the understated “Keep Driving,” the lyrics playing out like a stylish but stilted movie montage that takes the place of actual character development.Styles is such a magnetic onstage performer, provocative interview subject and fearlessly androgynous fashion plate that his records have come to feel like missed opportunities — the least personality-driven expressions of his otherwise compelling celebrity. “Harry’s House” is a light, fun, summery pop record, but there is a gaping void as its center; by its end, the listener is inclined to feel more intimately acquainted with the objects of his affections than the internal world of the titular character himself.Harry Styles“Harry’s House”(Columbia)";2022-05-20;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/arts/music/harry-styles-harrys-house-review.html;2022-05-21;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESHARRYSTYLESISSTILLADREAMYCIPHERONHISTHIRDLP,‘HARRY’SHOUSE’
The New York Times;Art Rupe, Who Brought Rhythm and Blues to the Mainstream, Dies at 104;As the founder of the independent label Specialty Records, he helped set the table for the rock ’n’ roll era by signing performers like Little Richard.;"Art Rupe, the founder of Specialty Records, an innovative independent label based in Los Angeles that brought rhythm and blues into the mainstream and helped set the table for the rock ’n’ roll era with singers like Little Richard and Lloyd Price, died on Friday at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 104.His death was announced by his daughter, Beverly Rupe Schwarz.Mr. Rupe created Specialty in 1946 with a niche audience in mind (hence the name). The major labels of the time, focused on mass-market pop hits, ignored the urbanized, blues-based music that appealed to Black audiences in the big cities. Mr. Rupe hoped to capitalize on this oversight by showcasing acts with “a big-band sound expressed in a churchy way,” as he put it to Arnold Shaw, the author of “Honkers and Shouters: The Golden Years of Rhythm and Blues” (1978).In the late 1940s and early ’50s, artists like Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield and Joe Liggins consistently put Specialty in the Top 10 of what were known as the “race record” charts until Billboard magazine began using the term “rhythm and blues” in 1949. In 1952, on a scouting trip to New Orleans, Mr. Rupe recorded Lloyd Price, then 19, singing his own composition, “Lawdy Miss Clawdy.” That record, which featured Fats Domino on piano, became the top-selling R&B record of the year and broke through to white listeners, too.ImageMr. Rupe hit one of rock ’n’ roll’s mother lodes when he signed Richard Penniman, known professionally as Little Richard, on the strength of a scratchy audition tape. Credit...SpecialtyThree years later, Mr. Rupe hit one of rock ’n’ roll’s mother lodes when he signed Richard Penniman, known professionally as Little Richard, on the strength of a scratchy audition tape. During a lunch break at a recording session in New Orleans, Little Richard sat down at the piano and shouted out a risqué song he used in his nightclub act: “Tutti Frutti.” With hastily rewritten lyrics, the song became one of rock’s early classics, and the first in a string of Little Richard hits that included “Long Tall Sally,” “Slippin’ and Slidin’,” “Rip It Up,” “Lucille,” “Keep a-Knockin’” and “Good Golly, Miss Molly.”“Art Rupe had a tremendous impact on rock ’n’ roll,” said John Broven, the author of “Record Makers and Breakers” (2009), a history of early rock ’n’ roll’s independent record producers. “‘Lawdy Miss Clawdy’ was really the first record to cross over and reach a teenage white audience, and then came Little Richard with ‘Tutti-Frutti’ and ‘Long Tall Sally.’ These were monumental records that almost created rock ’n’ roll in themselves.”Art Rupe was born Arthur Newton Goldberg on Sept. 5, 1917, in Greensburg, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, and grew up in nearby McKeesport, where his father, David, was a salesman at a secondhand furniture store and his mother, Anna, was a music lover. After attending Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Miami University in Ohio, he moved to Los Angeles in 1939.He enrolled in business courses at U.C.L.A. with the idea of entering the film business; he also changed his last name to Rupe after being told by a relative that it had been the family’s original surname in Europe. After World War II broke out, he worked at a local shipyard on an engineering crew that tested Liberty ships.The movie business, he found, was tough to enter, and he shifted his attention to the recording industry. Responding to a newspaper ad, he invested $2,500 in a new label, Atlas Records, which lost most of his money and failed to produce hits by its two main artists, Nat King Cole and Frankie Laine.ImageRoy Milton and His Solid Senders in a publicity photo.

He bought $200 worth of race records and, stopwatch in hand, began analyzing musical structure, tempo and even titles to identify the common characteristics of the best-selling releases. Since the word “boogie” appeared in a disproportionate number of hit songs, Juke Box’s first record, an instrumental by the Sepia Tones, was given the title “Boogie No. 1.” It sold a more than respectable 70,000 copies, and Mr. Rupe was on his way.The jump-blues singer Roy Milton and his band, the Solid Senders, gave Juke Box its first big hit: “R.M. Blues,” released in 1945, which was said to have sold a million copies. Mr. Milton went on to record nearly 20 Top 10 R&B hits after following Mr. Rupe to Specialty, which he founded the next year after breaking with his Juke Box partners.In 1950 the pianist and bandleader Joe Liggins gave Specialty its first No. 1 hit, “Pink Champagne,” which became the top-selling R&B record of the year. Percy Mayfield, a singer and songwriter with a relaxed, swinging style who would later contribute “Hit the Road, Jack” and other songs to Ray Charles’s repertoire, topped the charts a year later with “Please Send Me Someone to Love.” Guitar Slim gave the label yet another No. 1 hit in 1954 with “The Things That I Used to Do,” one of the earliest records to put the electric guitar front and center.“Specialty was a little like the Blue Note label in jazz,” said the singer and music historian Billy Vera, who produced “The Specialty Story,” a boxed set of the label’s best sides released in 1994, and wrote “Rip It Up: The Specialty Records Story,” published in 2019. “Art was dollar conscious, but he did not let that stop him from going into the better studios and taking the time to rehearse. He took great pride and care to make quality records with quality musicians.”Specialty exerted a powerful influence on the British invasion bands of the 1960s, and even its second-tier acts had a ripple effect. Larry Williams, a New Orleans singer groomed by Specialty to fill the void when Little Richard left the music business in 1957, had solid hits with “Short Fat Fannie” and “Bony Moronie,” but even his lesser singles made an impression overseas. His single “She Said Yeah” was covered by the Rolling Stones and the Animals. The Beatles recorded three of his songs: “Bad Boy,” “Dizzy Miss Lizzy” and “Slow Down.” Don and Dewey, another Specialty act, never had a hit, but their sound greatly influenced the Righteous Brothers and Sam and Dave.Mr. Rupe, a longtime fan of gospel music, quickly made Specialty’s gospel division an industry leader, signing the Pilgrim Travelers, the Swan Silvertones, Alex Bradford, Brother Joe May and Sister Wynona Carr. Two of the label’s most famous gospel groups generated crossover stars for other labels: Sam Cooke became a pop star after leaving the Soul Stirrers, as did Lou Rawls, who recorded with the Chosen Gospel Singers.Mr. Cooke was the one that got away. In 1956, he recorded a pop tune, “Lovable,” produced by Specialty’s Bumps Blackwell with a lush background chorus and released with the singer’s name thinly disguised as Dale Cook. Mr. Rupe disliked the smooth pop treatment and let Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Cooke leave the label with the other recordings from that session in hand. One song, “You Send Me,” became a chart-topping hit and ignited Mr. Cooke’s remarkable career.“In all candor, I did not think ‘You Send Me’ was that great,” Mr. Rupe told an interviewer for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. “I never dreamed it would be a multimillion seller.”ImageMr. Rupe in 2019. He sold Specialty’s catalog in 1990 and created the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation in 1991.Credit...Rauh Jewish Archives, Heinz History CenterBy 1960, Mr. Rupe was growing disenchanted with the record business, particularly with the widespread system of payola, which required record companies to pay off disc jockeys and distributors to get their records heard.Increasingly, he let assistants like Harold Battiste, in New Orleans, and Sonny Bono, in Los Angeles, produce and market the label’s records. In 1990, he sold Specialty’s catalog to Fantasy RecordsWhile still at Specialty, Mr. Rupe invested successfully in oil and real estate and started his own oil company. In 1991 he created the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, whose stated goals include “achieving positive social change by shining the light of truth on critical and controversial issues” and providing support for caregivers of people with dementia.In addition to his daughter — from the second of his three marriages, to Lee Apostoleris, which ended in divorce — Mr. Rupe is survived by a granddaughter; a step-grandson; and two step-great-granddaughters. His third wife, Dorothy Rupe, and three siblings died before him.In 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame gave Mr. Rupe the Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement, an honor given to record-company executives.“When I got into the business, few white people fooled around with this kind of music,” Mr. Rupe told Arnold Shaw. “I had no idea that it would ever appeal to so many white people.”";2022-04-16;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/arts/music/art-rupe-dead.html;2022-04-16;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESARTRUPE,WHOBROUGHTRHYTHMANDBLUESTOTHEMAINSTREAM,DIESAT104
The New York Times;Jose Llana (a.k.a. Ferdinand Marcos) Makes a Home in the Hamptons;When he’s not performing in “Here Lies Love,” a musical about the Philippines’s infamous first couple, this Broadway star finds refuge outside the city.;"It’s a few days after the Broadway opening of “Here Lies Love,” the David Byrne/Fatboy Slim poperetta that charts the rise and fall of the Philippines’s infamous first couple, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. And here sits Jose Llana — he plays Ferdinand — in the kitchen of the Hamptons, N.Y., weekend house he shares with his husband, Erik Rose, a real estate executive.At home, the Filipino-born Mr. Llana, 47, seems a perfect lamb. But onstage, he glowers with the best of them. There he is eight times a week, imposing martial law. There he was in the 2015 Lincoln Center production of “The King and I,” imposing his will as the ruler of Siam (and replacing Ken Watanabe). He also starred in the subsequent tours of “The King and I” around the United States and Britain.It is good to be king. The tidy sum Mr. Llana earned — and saved — during his reign on the road went far toward financing the Hamptons getaway, a shingle-style house that’s fit for a, well, you know, with a pool on a landscaped acre-and-a-half lot.“It was an incredible thing to be able to come back after all that time and say, ‘OK, what are we going to do with this lump of cash we now have?’” recalled Mr. Llana.The answer? “Let’s finally put it into a house that we’ve been talking about wanting to buy for years.”They briefly considered Bucks County, Pa., because Mr. Rose’s best friend has a house there. “Ultimately, though, we centered on the Hamptons,” Mr. Llana said.ImageJose Llana, a star of the Broadway musical “Here Lies Love,” owns a six-bedroom weekend house in the Hamptons with his husband, Erik Rose, a real estate executive. “The important thing was finding a place big enough to host our families,” Mr. Llana said. Credit...Eric Striffler for The New York TimesJose Llana, 47Occupation: ActorTime out: “Sometimes I’m in our apartment and I think, ‘I only have 24 hours. Do I really want to go out to the Hamptons?’ But the second the jitney turns into the South Fork, and I start to see trees, my shoulders drop.”But where in the Hamptons? A house hard by shops and restaurants would have been convenient, for sure, but also would have meant proximity to teeming humanity — exactly what the couple was leaving their Gramercy Park two-bedroom to escape. A place on the water was another nonstarter; Mr. Llana and Mr. Rose are not beach people. They are, most ardently, family people.Thus, the decision to choose a large house (almost 5,000 square feet) with six bedrooms in a wooded section of the East End of Long Island. They made an offer on the property in January of 2020 and were able to close in April despite the arrival of Covid-19.“The house became a wonderful refuge for us, and for my sister and her husband and their two kids, who live in Boston but moved in with us for five months,” Mr. Llana said.Post-pandemic, the house was the site of a 70th birthday celebration for Mr. Rose’s father, with both families in attendance. “Six bedrooms means we can have everyone here at the same time,” Mr. Llana said.Guests can choose, among other sleeping quarters, the appropriately named Blue Room, which has an indigo quilt decorated with a map of the Hamptons, including a sewn-in heart to mark the Llana-Rose home. On the walls: a raft of Filipino paintings.The Pink Room is accessorized with a pink silk orchid, a pink upholstered bench, a watercolor by Mr. Llana’s 98-year-old grandmother and a five-foot-tall giraffe sculpture made from recycled flip-flops.“My husband has a slight obsession with giraffes, because he is tall and gangly like a giraffe,” said Mr. Llana, who has a smaller version of the sculpture in his dressing room at the Broadway Theatre.Image“When we have family gatherings, everyone can just be in here together,” Mr. Llana said of the great room.Credit...Eric Striffler for The New York TimesFor the record, the couple do not host just family members; they also host the possessions of family members. Some years ago, when Mr. Llana’s mother, an accomplished cook, downsized from a house to an apartment, she expressed concern on Facebook that it would mean jettisoning her cherished cookbook collectionMr. Llana swung into action. “I called and told her, ‘Don’t. Don’t let them go. I will pay to put them in storage, because you know someday we might buy a house and we can keep them there.’”Someday is now. The books, from “Coconut Kitchen” to “The Joy of Cooking,” sit on shelves in the alcove library upstairs, jostling for space with Mr. Llana’s voluminous stash of Playbills, one from every show he has ever seen. On the library walls are small, framed posters of the shows he has appeared in. The spillover — including oversized lobby and front-of-theater placards (a few of them pilfered, but never mind) — is tucked away in the basement.The heart of the house is the double-height great room. The marine palette (blue and white) is a nod to the location. The fabric that covers the expansive sectional and the ottoman (tweed denim) is a nod to the owners’ “nothing-is-too-precious-here” attitude.“We want people to be able to sit and not worry that they’re going to put a stain on something,” Mr. Llana said. “Erik will always go for more high-end, aesthetically beautiful, modern pieces. And I’ll be like, ‘Well, is it comfortable?’ and we land somewhere in the middle.”Toward the end of last year, the couple sold their apartment on East 23rd Street and moved into a one-bedroom rental in NoMad. The death of their beloved Boston terrier, Charlie, was a driver in the decision. “That second bedroom had become a very expensive doggy-day-care room,” Mr. Llana said.ImageWhen Mr. Llana’s mother downsized from a house to an apartment, Mr. Llana became the custodian of her cookbook collection.Credit...Eric Striffler for The New York TimesBut he and Mr. Rose had also moved a lot of the things they cared about to the house and didn’t need as much space in the city.“I would never have said we were Hamptons people, until we had more and more friends here who I never would have thought of as Hamptons people either,” Mr. Llana said. “There’s this weird connotation, you know: Hamptons people are this negative thing.”He continued: “Erik and I both grew up in very middle-class families, if not lower-middle-class. We didn’t have weekend homes; we didn’t have friends who had weekend homes. I was an immigrant. My parents came to the United States with nothing.”He paused, clearly at pains to get this just right. “But you know, we’re in our late 40s, and both of our careers have really picked up. And I think for the first time we’re saying that we’re allowed to enjoy a little bit of the fruits of our labors and to create something that our families can enjoy.“What I’m trying to say,” he concluded, “is that we’ve worked hard to get here. So maybe we are Hamptons people after all.”For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.";2023-07-31;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/realestate/jose-llana-hamptons.html;2023-08-02;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESJOSELLANA(A.K.A.FERDINANDMARCOS)MAKESAHOMEINTHEHAMPTONS
The New York Times;David Byrne’s ‘Here Lies Love’ Reaches Deal With Broadway Musicians;After the musicians’ union raised objections to the show’s plans to use recorded music instead of a live band, the show agreed to use 12 musicians.;"“Here Lies Love,” the new David Byrne musical scheduled to start previews on Broadway next week, has bowed to objections by a labor union and agreed that 12 musicians will be part of the production.The producers of the musical, which is a dance-club-like show about Imelda Marcos, and the union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, announced the agreement late Friday afternoon.“On behalf of our entire cast, company and creative team, we have reached an agreement with Musicians Union Local 802, per the collective bargaining agreement,” the producers of the musical said in a statement. “We look forward to welcoming audiences to experience the revolutionary musical experience that is ‘Here Lies Love’ at the Broadway Theater beginning on Saturday, June 17.”The union issued a similarly terse, but slightly more detailed, statement, saying, “After negotiation, we have reached an agreement that will bring live music to ‘Here Lies Love’ with the inclusion of 12 musicians to the show. Broadway is a very special place with the best musicians and performances in the world, and we are glad this agreement honors that tradition.”Eric Koch, a communications consultant for the union, said three of the company’s actors would be counted among the 12 musicians.Asked about that, the producers responded: “‘Here Lies Love’ has always had three actor-musicians and a musical director in every production. The show’s integrity and the musical concept remains the same.”“Here Lies Love” is being led by a group of producers, including Patrick Catullo, Hal Luftig, Kevin Connor, Jose Antonio Vargas, Diana DiMenna and Clint Ramos. The show is one of the larger productions opening on Broadway this summer, with a big budget — it is being capitalized for up to $22 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission — and plans to redo the Broadway Theater so that the production can be staged in an immersive fashion, with much of the audience on a dance floor surrounded by the action.“Here Lies Love,” about Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, was written by Byrne and Fatboy Slim. It has been around for more than 15 years, and has been praised by critics and popular with audiences. It was presented as a song cycle at Carnegie Hall in 2007, and there were productions in 2012 at Mass MoCA, an art museum in the Berkshires; in 2013 at the Public Theater in New York; in 2014 at London’s National Theater and back at the Public for a second engagement; and in 2017 at the Seattle Repertory Theater.The production has in the past used recorded music, which the show said was meant to create a karaoke-like atmosphere, but as the Broadway opening neared, the labor union objected, saying its contract with the Broadway League requires the use of live musicians. The union had threatened to protest this weekend’s Tony Awards and the show’s upcoming previews; on Friday, the two sides settled the dispute.";2023-06-09;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/theater/david-byrne-here-lies-love-broadway-musicians-union.html;2023-06-11;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESDAVIDBYRNE’S‘HERELIESLOVE’REACHESDEALWITHBROADWAYMUSICIANS
The New York Times;Hayley Kiyoko Revs Up With Arcade Fire and Chills Out to ‘Friends’;The pop singer and songwriter has been doing some emotional spring cleaning as she prepares to release her second full-length album, “Panorama.”;The pop singer and songwriter Hayley Kiyoko’s fans call her “lesbian Jesus,” and she’s become known for boldly and unapologetically putting every facet of herself into her artistry. That wasn’t always the case, however.“Growing up I would write music in my bedroom with a guitar on my bed, or in my journal,” she said, “and I would use he/him pronouns, and it took a long time for me to obviously speak my truth, lyrically.”Kiyoko, 31, was born and raised in Los Angeles, and expressed her interest in music and performing at a very young age, acting in commercials, then in films and on TV. In 2007, she joined a girl group called the Stunners that also included the R&B singer Tinashe. After its 2011 split, she started carving out a solo career. Her 2015 EP “This Side of Paradise” provided a breakthrough moment with the electro-pop track “Girls Like Girls,” which was also a coming out of sorts. Kiyoko directed its video, a queer teen love story depicting a girl with a boyfriend falling for her best friend, which has 147 million views on YouTube.For her second album, “Panorama” (due July 29), Kiyoko said she’s presenting a more refined version of herself sonically, melodically and lyrically — the result of some crucial emotional spring cleaning. “You have a lot of stuff in your room and it’s like, do you really need all of that?” she explained. Part of the process involved taking down the walls she’d built as a young songwriter who was trying to mask what she was actually trying to say. “Hey, I’m comfortable with myself,” she said she realized. “I love myself and I’m at a place in my life where I don’t need you anymore.”For “Panorama,” Kiyoko brought back a few collaborators from her first album, “Expectations,” (the writers Nikki Flores and Brandon Colbein) and introduced some new ones (the producers Danja, Patrick Morrissey and Kill Dave). The album’s first single, “For the Girls,” is a bass-boosted anthem of empowerment that arrived with a queer “Bachelorette” parody music video, featuring a cameo from the real-life “Bachelor” contestant Becca Tilley. (Kiyoko and Tilley have been dating for four years.) On the mid-tempo thumper “Deep in the Woods,” Kiyoko softens her voice to describe meeting someone and feeling like you’ve known them forever. And on “Luna,” a love letter to a crush, Kiyoko jumps octaves as she sings, “You get me wild you know/I’ll chase your shadow.”“We spent a lot of time making sure that everything that you hear and experience is as close to and true to my experience,” she said.On a phone call from her studio at home in Los Angeles, Kiyoko shared a list of the things that continue to inspire her. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.1. “The Voice of Knowledge” by Don Miguel Ruiz I recently started reading and I’m not going to be ashamed to say that, because it’s just the truth. I fell in love with this book. It really supports you and helps you find a way to navigate those voices in your head, what is reality and what is your 5-year-old self afraid of, or your past trauma, or fears. It’s really helped my mental health a lot.2. Arcade Fire’s “Ready to Start” If I’m having a hard day or not feeling inspired I’ll go for a walk and listen to “Ready to Start” and it is like what that title is: It’s a reset for me. It invigorates me and inspires me to keep going. It validates my fears and my sadness. Arcade Fire is one of my favorite bands and I listened to them a lot growing up, so I think I find a lot of comfort and nostalgia listening to Arcade Fire, but then that song specifically, I really resonate with the lyrics.3. Her own fragrance, Hue Growing up as a queer kid in the closet, I had a really hard time having conversations with cute girls. My only way of having conversations with cute girls was when I smelled good. I would put on perfume and go to school and they’d be like, “Hey, you smell really good” or “What are you wearing?” It was a conversation starter and also boosted my confidence when I felt really insecure, so I wanted to create a perfume that could give my fans confidence and was gender inclusive. I think I’ve always struggled with my femininity and masculinity and which box I fit in, so I wanted to create a perfume that kind of symbolized and represented both my masculine and feminine energy in one bottle. It has this really nice balance of fruity floral and musk.4. “Friends” I probably watch three episodes every single night. Jennifer Aniston is like my safe space. I can always laugh and just decompress watching that show. I remember going through a hard breakup and I was living alone and I would just turn on “Friends” and felt like I was with a bunch of friends. I feel like I can watch that show and see little bits and pieces of my friends and family in the characters, so it’s just ever-evolving.5. Monopoly Deal It’s basically like a more convenient Monopoly but you can play it faster and you get your properties at random. It’s one of my favorite games because each card is worth millions of dollars. I used to play it all the time during the pandemic. I love playing it with my friends because you can charge your friends $11 million and they have to give it to you. I bring it with me everywhere in my purse.6. Journaling I have so many journals. Growing up, aunts, uncles or random parental friends would gift me journals and I’d be like, “What am I going to do with this?” They would just sit on my desk and then I began to love writing in them. It’s so incredible just to have a dialogue with myself for therapy. I also like to go back and read my journals because it reminds me of the things that I’ve overcome, especially during the dark times. It helps me feel centered in where I’m at, that I can keep going and that I’m resilient and strong. If I’m on a plane for six hours I’m not watching the TV, I’m journaling.7. Fried eggplant Growing up, I hated Japanese nights because my mom would make this fried eggplant and we’d have spinach and rice and ginger and all these things. There were so many plates. The soy sauce plate, the ginger plate, the edamame plate. Every time after Japanese night, my mom and dad would be like, “OK, kids, you guys can do the dishes.” And I remember being like, “No, I don’t want to do the dishes!” Now looking back, it’s one of my favorite meals and it’s a meal that I probably have once a week to comfort myself. If I’m stressed or just needing to feel love I’ll make that meal and I don’t complain about the dishes anymore.8. Premiere Pro I’m going to shout out Premiere Pro because as an artist, I became a director out of necessity. Wanting to be a storyteller and learning how to edit and having to kind of do everything myself, I was really grateful for Premiere Pro because it was a way for me to be able to tell my stories and have my stories come to life visually. It gave me the courage to be like, “Hey, I can direct, and I can do this.”9. Acupuncture Acupuncture has been a huge part of my healing process: taking care of my body and making sure that my blood circulation is good. I think I struggled with meditation, and acupuncture helped me get to that point of being able to practice meditating because when I go to acupuncture I just lay and I’m able to just be. It’s such an incredible reset for my body and my mind.10. Claude Monet I have always been inspired by color and I want to say a lot of that has to do with really connecting to Claude Monet’s Impressionism. My mouse pad is the sunrise painting and I have big Claude Monet paintings all over my apartment. Color has just always created a sense of ease, calm and safety. I think that translates in my music videos and directing — wanting to create a world where the color palette feels inviting, warm, safe and nostalgic. When I write music, and when I was working on “Panorama,” I always see color. I listen to a song and I’m like, “OK, this is like dark purple or this is like purple and lime green.”;2022-07-19;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/arts/music/hayley-kiyoko-favorites.html;2022-07-24;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESHAYLEYKIYOKOREVSUPWITHARCADEFIREANDCHILLSOUTTO‘FRIENDS’
The New York Times;glaive Flexes the Less Hyper Side of His Pop, and 13 More New Songs;Hear tracks by Raveena, the Weather Station, Immanuel Wilkins and others.;"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.glaive, ‘Icarus’The ostensibly summery, mid-tempo “Icarus” shows off the relatively less hyper side of the hyperpop star glaive, though its lines still hit like angst-ridden daggers: “We’re flying too close to the sun,” he sings to his romantic partner in crime. A highlight from the deluxe edition of his 2021 EP “All Dogs Go to Heaven” (cheekily retitled “Old Dog, New Tricks”),“Icarus” has an instantly catchy hook that shows why many hail glaive as the potential breakout star of his underground subgenre. But the song still retains an appealingly edgy sense of emotional mayhem: “I’m setting fire to my room, ’cause I don’t know what else to do!” LINDSAY ZOLADZThe Smile, ‘The Smoke’The Smile — Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead with Tom Skinner, a drummer from Sons of Kemet — has quickly demonstrated its range. The trio snarled through its first single, “You Will Never Work in Television Again,” only to play things cool on its second, “The Smoke.” A minute-long instrumental intro sticks to syncopated bass and dub-echoed drums, in a 10-bar pattern that threatens to trip up unwary dancers as it seems to switch between 4/4 and waltz. Yorke’s high vocals and a hazy horn arrangement join the rhythmic crosscurrent as he sings about what might be the heat of desire or destruction, crooning, “Smoke wakes me from my sleep.” JON PARELESImmanuel Wilkins, ‘Fugitive Ritual, Selah’Peaceful and incantatory, “Fugitive Ritual, Selah” offers a moment to re-center amid the dicey, kinetic tour de force that is “The 7th Hand,” the alto saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins’s second album with his quartet. Wilkins is more often in a high-octane mode, but here he nearly caresses each note. He wrote “Fugitive Ritual, Selah” — which weaves through a melody built around harmonic shifts until finally landing on a repetitious, soothing coda — as a tribute to spaces like the Black church, where a distance from the white gaze allows for freer expression. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLOPierre Kwenders, ‘Papa Wemba’The Congolese musician Pierre Kwenders was born in Kinshasa and has lived in Montreal since 2001. “Papa Wemba,” from an album due in April, is a tribute to the singer, bandleader and snappy dresser Papa Wemba, who brought Congolese rumba, or soukous, to an international audience from the 1970s until his death in 2016. “Papa Wemba” adds electronic clout to the soukous beat — it sounds like it’s being punched out on a Teletype — and stirs up a rhythmic vortex with echoing guitars, gruffly sung and chanted vocals and a twin-saxophone riff that approximates the horns saying “Papa Wemba.” PARELESRaveena featuring Vince Staples, ‘Secret’Serpentine and luxurious, Raveena’s “Secret” is a pulsing after-hours affair. With her barely there voice, the R&B singer whispers silken come-ons, a steady thrum ricocheting off a muted tabla drum. It’s retrograde but futuristic, like the forthcoming concept album it appears on, which tells the story of a space princess from ancient Punjab. “Wait a sec, I’ll hit you right back,” Raveena coos in the chorus. You can almost feel her hot breath on your neck. ISABELIA HERRERASaba featuring G Herbo, ‘Survivor’s Guilt’“Survivor’s Guilt” is filled with wounds, yet Saba’s flow is breathless, like he’s outrunning the aftermath of trauma in real time. “I’m trying to move better/What’s really eating when you from a food desert,” he raps, echoing the hyper-speed flows of chopper forebears like Twista. A guest verse from G Herbo cements the song as an unforgettably Chicago linkup. HERRERAEx-Void, ‘Churchyard’Reuniting two members of the too-short-lived noise-pop band Joanna Gruesome, Ex-Vöid is a relatively new, jangly British power-pop group set to release its debut album later this year. The lush, taut “Churchyard” retains their previous band’s keen sense of melody, but this time favoring the sort of clean, bright guitar tones that broadcast their penchant for pop songcraft loud and clear. ZOLADZTess Parks, ‘Happy Birthday Forever’Tess Parks’s voice has an alluring, husky grain on “Happy Birthday Forever,” the first single from her upcoming album, “And Those Who Were Seen Dancing.” The Toronto-born artist hasn’t released an LP since her 2013 debut “Blood Hot,” and has since been collaborating with Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but “Happy Birthday Forever” proves she’s a confident, enchanting presence on her own. The song is propelled by a jaunty beat and a bright piano riff, but there’s a dark undercurrent to the way Parks delivers her lines, like she’s exhaling cigarette smoke from the corner of her mouth: “Get me outta here.” ZOLADZDora Jar, ‘Lagoon’A lurching drumbeat, a barely tuned piano: The songwriter Dora Jar — who has lived in New York, California, Poland and England — doesn’t need much more to profess her longing in “Lagoon,” in terms both mundane and surreal: “My heart is a crustacean/Could you come and crack it open?” There’s an Elton John backbeat in her piano chords, but also a 21st-century sense of possibility, as vocal overdubs surround her and, for some reason, what sounds like a banjo surfaces near the end of the tune. PARELESThe Weather Station, ‘Endless Time’“It’s only the end of an endless time,” Tamara Lindeman sings in the opening moments of this shattering new ballad, the first song released from the Weather Station’s upcoming album, “How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars.” Lindeman has said the March 4 LP is a kind of companion piece to last year’s excellent “Ignorance,” and “Endless Time” certainly mirrors its predecessor’s chilling evocation of loss as well as its elegant weaving together of the personal and ecological. But while “Ignorance” experimented with fractured, jazzy rhythms, “Endless Time” echoes through a sparse negative space — just a haunting piano accompaniment and Lindeman’s elegiac vocals. Any “companion record” to a strong artistic statement risks being dismissed as a collection of B-sides, but this arresting first single is Lindeman bringing her “A” game. ZOLADZDonna Missal, ‘Insecure’​​Sooner or later, every sound ricochets around Donna Missal’s “Insecure”: ticks and taps of percussion, calm keyboard note clusters, grainy simulated strings and whispery vocals that split into harmonies, get pitched up and down and waft up out of nowhere. “Never want to see you again,” she announces as the song begins, and she goes on to denounce her “baby” as an unapologetic liar. But the confrontation is hushed, private and solitary, as if it’s taking place in a sonic hall of mirrors. PARELESKatie Dey, ‘Real Love’The Australian songwriter Katie Dey is both deadpan and devastating as she sings about an abusive relationship and her own self-destructive impulses in “Real Love.” The verses have an offhand sound — a thumpy drumbeat, dinky keyboard chords — as she recalls how “I made myself small/you made yourself big,” but her vocals take on hyperpop glitches and an Auto-Tuned edge on the way to a chorus that crashes in with distorted guitars, as she declares, “I want love that hurts.” PARELESTyler Mitchell featuring Marshall Allen, ‘A Call for All Demons’The bassist Tyler Mitchell played briefly in Sun Ra’s Arkestra during the 1980s, then put in decades of work as a straight-ahead jazz musician before rejoining the group about 10 years ago, after its patriarch had died. By now, he’s a deeply embedded member of the band. Leading his own sextet on a new album, “Dancing Shadows” — with the Arkestra luminary and alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, 97, as a featured guest — Mitchell covers a range of Sun Ra material alongside his own tunes; throughout, he guides things from below with the same bobbing, pulpy vigor that makes him sound at home in the Arkestra. “A Call for All Demons” is a tune that Sun Ra first recorded in the 1950s, and on Mitchell’s album it serves as the opening invocation. RUSSONELLONyokabi Kariūki, ‘Equator Song’Nyokabi Kariūki’s “Equator Song” radiates the dissonance of bilingual (or even trilingual) existence. Kariūki, who grew up in Kenya and now lives in Maryland, recorded the song on a trip to Kenya’s Laikipia county, collaging the chatter of weaverbirds — wordless, sky-high vocalizations floating into the ether. “You’ll find my soul on someone’s tongue,” she sings in English, harnessing the experience of living in a language that will never be your own. But instead of lingering in the discomfort or seeking some empty form of reconnection, Kariūki moves fluidly between English, Maa and Kiswahili. It is an acceptance of the diaspora’s constant condition of loss, and the beauty that exists within it.

The New York Times;Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro’s Love Trilogy, and 8 More New Songs;Hear tracks from Meshell Ndegeocello, the Japanese House, Hannah Jadagu and others.;"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new tracks. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage, and The Amplifier, a twice-weekly guide to new and old songs.Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro, ‘Beso’“Beso” (“Kiss”) quivers with fear of separation, as Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro tell each other that “Being away from you is hell.” The song is part of a three-track collaborative project called “RR” the couple released on Friday; the “Beso” video hints at an engagement. They keep their voices high, small and tremulous over a brusque beat topped with quasi-Baroque keyboards and strings, a genteel backdrop for deep neediness. PARELESMeshell Ndegeocello, ‘Virgo’“They’re calling me back to the stars,” Meshell Ndegeocello declares in “Virgo” from her coming album, “The Omnichord Real Book.” It’s a funky march that revels in cosmic imagery, cross-rhythms and multifarious vocals: singing, chanting, making percussive sounds, high harmonies, husky low confidences and an occasional “la-la.” Morphing through nearly nine minutes, the track struts on Ndegeocello’s synthesizer bass lines; twinkles and hovers with Brandee Younger’s harp; and sprints toward the end with double time drumming, headed somewhere new. PARELESMoor Mother featuring Kyle Kidd, Keir Neuringer and Aquiles Navarro, ‘We Got the Jazz’Moor Mother seethes about Black achievements met with disrespect in “We Got the Jazz”: “We ain’t ’bout to stand for no national anthem,” she declaims. “When we was swinging they couldn’t even stand in attention.” Her testy voice is surrounded in a rich, polytonal murk: multiple tracks of Aquiles Navarro’s trumpet, Keir Neuringer’s saxophone and Kyle Kidd’s vocals over a slowly heaving bass line, burdened but determined. PARELESThe Japanese House, ‘Boyhood’The British musician Amber Bain, who records as the Japanese House, reckons with her past and present on the flickering synth-pop track “Boyhood,” which pairs smooth sonic surfaces and effervescent electronic flourishes with her yearning, achingly human vocals. “For a moment there, I swear I saw me,” Bain sings, her 20-something growing pains palpable as she yearns — in vain — for a stable, unchanging sense of self. ZOLADZRina Sawayama, ‘Eye for an Eye’The British-Japanese pop musician Rina Sawayama makes her film debut on Friday in “John Wick: Chapter 4,” and has released a new song from the soundtrack, the slinky “Eye for an Eye.” The track splits the difference between Sawayama’s gloriously bombastic debut album, “Sawayama,” and the softer, more recent “Hold the Girl.” Propelled by a mid-tempo, industrial chug, Sawayama vamps with the confident menace of an action star. “A life for a life,” she sings. “I’ll see you in hell on the other side.” ZOLADZBully, ‘Days Move Slow’“Days Move Slow,” from Alicia Bognanno’s grungy indie-rock project Bully, is a song about being caught in the muck of grief — she wrote it after the death of her beloved dog, Mezzi — but it also has a propulsive, bouncy energy that promises eventual forward motion. “There’s flowers on your grave that grow,” Bognanno sings in her signature holler, battling her buzzing guitar. “Something’s gotta change, I know.” ZOLADZShygirl, ‘Woe (I See It From Your Side) (Björk Remix)’Björk’s remix of Shygirl’s “Woe” is equal parts endorsement and disruption. Shygirl, born Blaine Muise in England to parents from Zimbabwe, has worked with pop experimenters like Sophie, Arca, Tinashe and Sega Bodega, and she was a founder of the label Nuxxe. “Woe,” from her 2022 debut album, “Nymph,” was a smoldering counterattack to a toxic partner: “Smiling faces fade just to leave a shell,” she charged. Björk, playing fourth-dimensional chess, offers both sympathy — agreeing with Shygirl that “I see it from your side” — and outside perspective. The new track lurches from the dark groove of “Woe” to something else: Björk’s vocal harmonies, warped keyboard vamps and mystical life lessons. “Forever we shoot for the sublime,” she advises. PARELESHannah Jadagu, ‘Warning Sign’“Warning Sign” is a hushed, hazy song that maps interpersonal tensions onto musical contrasts: quiet and loud, sustained and rhythmic, dulcet and distorted. Jadagu is an N.Y.U. student who grew up in a Texas suburb and recorded her first EP, in 2021, entirely on an iPhone. She has more resources since signing to Sub Pop. “Warning Sign” could have been an easygoing R&B vamp, but Jadagu has other imperatives; the song coos with keyboard chords and airborne harmonies, then crashes or glitches. What she hears goes with what she feels: “I can’t stand to hear your voice when it’s oh so loud/Could you quiet down?” PARELESLucinda Chua featuring Yeule, ‘Something Other Than Years’The songs on “Yian” (Chinese for “sparrow”), the new album by the London-based songwriter Lucinda Chua, are meditations seeking serenity — often just two alternating chords, set out slowly on keyboard and sustained by orchestral strings. In “Something Other Than Years,” she sings, “When all I fear is all I know/Show me how to live this life,” and she’s answered by the higher voice of Yeule, who promises, “There’s more in this life/Angel being of light.” PARELES";2023-03-24;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/arts/music/playlist-rosalia-rauw-alejandro-shygirl-bjork.html;2023-03-25;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESROSALÍAANDRAUWALEJANDRO’SLOVETRILOGY,AND8MORENEWSONGS
The New York Times;Fuzzy Haskins, Who Helped Turn Doo-Wop Into P-Funk, Dies at 81;As a teenager, he joined forces with George Clinton. Their vocal group, the Parliaments, morphed into Parliament-Funkadelic, one of the wildest acts of the 1970s.;"Fuzzy Haskins, a foundational member of the vocal group that morphed into Parliament-Funkadelic, the genre-blurring collective led by George Clinton that shook up the pop music world in the 1970s, died on March 16 in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich. He was 81.His son Nowell Scott said the cause was health problems complicated by diabetes.Mr. Haskins, one of Parliament-Funkadelic’s vocalists and songwriters, was a distinctive presence onstage during the group’s propulsive performances, often wearing tight long johns and sometimes suggestively straddling the microphone.“Fuzzy was always able to capture your attention,” Mr. Scott said by email, “rhythmically gyrating the audience into a deeper consciousness where night after night they were forced to consider if they were really getting it on.”Mr. Haskins was living in Edison, N.J., and was in his last year of high school and singing in a vocal group when he met Mr. Clinton, who had a barbershop in nearby Plainfield and his own fledgling vocal group. Someone from Mr. Clinton’s group had left.“So they chose me out of my group to come and sing with them,” Mr. Haskins recalled in 2011 in a short biographical video. He joined up with Mr. Clinton, Calvin Simon, Grady Thomas and Ray Davis, and, Mr. Haskins said, “the rest is history.”ImageParliament-Funkadelic in 1971. Mr. Haskins is at the far left; George Clinton is fifth from left, uncharacteristically in the background.Credit...Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThe group was called the Parliaments, named after a cigarette brand, Mr. Clinton said in his book “Brothas Be, Yo Like George, Ain’t That Funkin’ Kinda Hard on You?” (2014).Mr. Clinton didn’t smoke, but, he wrote, “I thought cigarettes were cool as a symbol, a little dangerous, a little adult, and Parliament was a big brand, so we became the Parliaments.”The group worked a doo-wop sound at first.“Each of us had a distinctive style,” Mr. Clinton wrote, “sometimes in imitation of people who were famous then, sometimes in anticipation of people who would be famous later.”“Fuzzy,” he added, “who was second lead, was a soulful tenor with all the bluesy inflections, like Wilson Pickett, real rough.”The Parliaments had a Top 20 pop hit in 1967 with “(I Wanna) Testify.” Soon the group became simply Parliament and developed an alter ego, Funkadelic. Two different groups, they recorded for two different labels but drew on the same ever-growing collection of musicians. Parliament remained vocally oriented; Funkadelic borrowed from psychedelic rock and the funk sound of groups like Sly and the Family Stone.“White rock groups had done the blues, and we wanted to head back in the other direction,” Mr. Clinton wrote, “be a Black rock group playing the loudest, funkiest combination of psychedelic rock and thunderous R&B.”Mr. Haskins wrote the song “I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody’s Got a Thing” for Funkadelic’s debut album, called simply “Funkadelic” and released in 1970. He joined Mr. Clinton in writing “My Automobile” for Parliament’s first album, “Osmium,” released the same year. He was one of four writers (including Mr. Clinton) of “Up for the Down Stroke,” the title song on Parliament’s second album, released in 1974. And he had a hand in other songs for both groups as they released records throughout the ’70s.The stage shows accompanying the album releases grew increasingly elaborate, culminating in the P-Funk Earth Tour, which began in 1976, continued for several years and featured an outer-space theme, including an onstage spaceship.But the original Parliaments were clashing with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Haskins, who had recorded a solo album in 1976, “A Whole Nother Thang,” left the group in 1977 along with Mr. Simon and Mr. Thomas. Under the name Funkadelic, the three released an album that same year, “Connections & Disconnections,” which included tracks openly criticizing Mr. Clinton.ImageMr. Haskins recorded a solo album in 1976, shortly before leaving Parliament-Funkadelic.Mr. Haskins released another solo album, “Radio Active,” in 1978.In the early 1990s, he, Mr. Simon, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Davis formed a group called Original P, whose repertoire was heavy on songs from the Parliament-Funkadelic catalog.“This act gives us the chance to perform these songs the way they were meant to be heard,” Mr. Haskins told Mountain Xpress, a North Carolina alternative newspaper, in 2000, “with solid arrangements and clear vocal harmonies. We were involved in the creation of these songs, and they are our children.”Whatever the disagreements were with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Haskins was among the 16 members who were honored in 1997 when the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducted Parliament-Funkadelic, who were introduced at the ceremony by Prince.“Parliament and Funkadelic were the mind-blowing, soul-expanding musical equivalent of an acid trip,” the hall’s website says. “They grabbed the funk movement from James Brown and took off running.”Clarence Eugene Haskins was born on June 8, 1941, in Elkhorn, W.Va. His father, McKinley, was a coal miner, and his mother, Grace Bertha (Hairston) Haskins, was a homemaker.“I listened to country when I grew up,” Mr. Haskins said in the biographical video, since there was not much R&B or other Black music on West Virginia radio at the time.“We used to sing church music — hymns, gospel — at home,” he added. “We’d harmonize.”The family relocated to New Jersey when he was still a child. Before long he had met Mr. Clinton, and he was on his way.“The P-Funk sound is perhaps one of the most significant and impactful crossed-over ideas to ever manifest into a sound,” his son said by email, “and Fuzzy was always excited to be a part of that.”Mr. Haskins lived in Southfield, Mich. His marriages to Estelle James and Lorraine Dabney ended in divorce. In addition to his son, his survivors include two other children, Crystal White and Michelle Fields; a sister, Julia Drew; and 10 grandchildren. Two other children, Michael and Stephanie, died before him.Mr. Haskins was to be inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame in May.";2023-03-24;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/arts/music/fuzzy-haskins-dead.html;2023-03-25;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESFUZZYHASKINS,WHOHELPEDTURNDOO-WOPINTOP-FUNK,DIESAT81
The New York Times;Nicki Minaj Returns Ready to Rumble, and 8 More New Songs;Hear tracks by Kali Uchis and Summer Walker, Arlo Parks, 6lack and others.;"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.Nicki Minaj, ‘Red Ruby Da Sleeze’Calm arrogance is Nicki Minaj’s gift. There’s no need to decipher all her allusions because her delivery and production say it all. The track of “Red Ruby Da Sleeze,” based on Lumidee’s “Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh),” juggles near-flamenco handclaps, trap drums and choral vocals going “Uh-oh.” Her percussive rhymes are competitive in every realm — linguistic, sexual, financial, culinary (“guacamole with the taco”) — and their utter confidence is still convincing. JON PARELESKali Uchis and Summer Walker, ‘Deserve Me’“Red Moon in Venus,” the third studio album by the cheerfully bilingual Colombian American songwriter Kali Uchis, moves between sensual romance and fierce recriminations. “Deserve Me” is blunt: “I like it better when you’re gone/I feel a little less alone.” Uchis and Summer Walker take turns bad-mouthing the thoughtless lover who’s getting dumped, and harmonize sweetly to remind him, “You don’t deserve me.” The track starts out light and tinkly but keeps adding bassy layers, literally showing the depth of their contempt. PARELESboygenius, ‘Not Strong Enough’The indie-rock trio boygenius — Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker — formed in 2018, under a cheeky moniker that, Dacus said in an interview, was meant to harness some macho overconfidence: “We were just talking about boys and men we know who’ve been told that they are geniuses since they could hear, basically, and what type of creative work comes out of that upbringing.” The group’s stirring, acoustic-guitar-driven new single “Not Strong Enough” once again finds the women in provocative but poetic drag, as they harmonize on a chorus that answers Sheryl Crow: “I don’t know why I am the way I am, not strong enough to be your man.” On a steadily galloping bridge, Dacus leads the trio in a chant that expresses frustration at being “always an angel, never a god.” But by the end of the candid “Not Strong Enough,” boygenius has generated its own kind of strength in vulnerability — and in numbers. LINDSAY ZOLADZArlo Parks, ‘Impurities’The English songwriter Arlo Parks has absorbed Joni Mitchell, hip-hop and much more; it’s no wonder she is willing to enjoy her “Impurities.” Her new track revolves around echoey loops and samples, but she has a paradoxical lesson to impart: “When you embrace all my impurities, then I feel clean again.” PARELESMandy, Indiana, ‘Pinking Shears’On the echoey, percussion-forward “Pinking Shears,” the Manchester art-rockers Mandy, Indiana forcefully and exhaustedly reject an increasingly mechanized world: “J’suis fatiguée” (“I’m tired”) becomes a kind of mantra when chanted by the band’s vocalist Valentine Caulfield. But there’s catharsis and resistance in the industrial abrasion of the sound they create, like a rogue machine created from cobbled-together parts suddenly learning how to talk back. ZOLADZWater From Your Eyes, ‘Barley’The hypnotic “Barley,” from the Brooklyn duo Water From Your Eyes, sounds a bit like a playground chant reimagined by Sonic Youth: “One, two, three, counter, you’re a cool thing, count mountains,” Rachel Brown drones in a charismatic deadpan. The song — and first single from the forthcoming album “Everyone’s Crushed,” which comes out on May 26 — is full of loopy left-turns and unexpected riffs that jut out at odd angles, but Brown and bandmate Nate Amos are, at all times, utterly in command of their strange and alluring sonic universe. ZOLADZ6lack, ‘Since I Have a Lover’6lack positions himself between singer and rapper on “Since I Have a Lover,” which has a looped feeling. He barely projects his voice, but he rides the rhythm of a loping, two-chord guitar track as he promises more than a passing attraction. Will it last? The song suggests a woozy maybe. PARELESPrincess Nokia, ‘Lo Siento’Steady, wistful piano chords carry Princess Nokia through “Lo Siento” (“I’m Sorry”) from her EP due March 14, “I Love You But This Is Goodbye.” It’s not really an apology; as the production blooms into lush, pillowy harmonies, she switches from singing in English to calmly rapping in Spanish, cursing her lover for betrayal and noting, “Thanks for the pain, the pain in my song.” PARELESyMusic, ‘Zebras’A seven-beat rhythm percolates through “Zebras,” a minimalistic but eventful romp by the chamber sextet yMusic. The rhythm hops from key clicks on a bass clarinet to pizzicato strings; it’s juxtaposed with sighing melody lines and hints of a circus band, making the most of its three-and-a-half minutes.

The New York Times;Shakira and Ozuna’s Breakup Bachata, and 7 More New Songs;Hear tracks by Caroline Polachek, John Cale featuring Weyes Blood, iLe and others.;"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.Shakira and Ozuna, ‘Monotonía’Here’s a rarity: a no-fault breakup song. Well, not entirely. “It wasn’t your fault, nor was it mine,” Shakira offers at the start. “It was the fault of the monotony.” Shakira, from Colombia, meets Ozuna, who was born in Puerto Rico to a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother, closer to his musical territory: a Dominican bachata, with staccato guitar arpeggios and flurries of bongos. As they trade verses, accusations emerge: he was a narcissist, she was distant, what was incredible turned routine. Bachata puts heartbreak at a distance by placing it within a neatly syncopated grid; both Shakira and Ozuna sing like they’ll get over it. JON PARELESCaroline Polachek, ‘Sunset’Flamenco might seem an odd sound for the avant-garde pop star Caroline Polachek to embrace — Rosalía’s influence, perhaps? — but her ever-gleaming vocals dance nimbly enough across “Sunset” to make the whole thing work. “These days I wear my body like an uninvited guest,” she sings on the verse, her fleet-footed verbosity conveying a sense of itchy anxiety. But that’s all resolved by the chorus, when Polachek’s vocal pacing suddenly slows, comforted by a romantic embrace: “He said, no regrets, ’cause you’re my sunset.” LINDSAY ZOLADZJohn Cale featuring Weyes Blood, ‘Story of Blood’The legendary John Cale — whose crucial contributions to the development of the Velvet Underground’s sound Todd Haynes refreshingly reasserted last year in his documentary about the band — has long been a generous collaborator with younger artists at this later stage in his career. His forthcoming album “Mercy,” his first collection of new songs in a decade, continues that pattern, featuring contributions from Animal Collective, Sylvan Esso and Laurel Halo. The haunting “Story of Blood,” the first offering from “Mercy,” features bewitching vocals from the indie luminary Natalie Mering, who records as Weyes Blood. Across a patiently paced seven-minute reverie of synth chords and skittish electronic beats, their voices entwine balletically, as if locked in some kind of otherworldly dance. ZOLADZNxWorries featuring H.E.R., ‘Where I Go’Anderson .Paak brings the plush nostalgia of Silk Sonic, his Grammy-winning alliance with Bruno Mars, back to an earlier collaboration: Nxworries, his project with the producer Knxledge, which released an album in 2016. In “Where I Go,” Anderson .Paak professes love, generosity and regrets for past affairs. But H.E.R. sings about lingering suspicions and, in the video, finds solid evidence; neither his blandishments nor the purr of an electric sitar can smooth things over. PARELESKelela, ‘Happy Ending’After a long absence, Kelela wafted back into public earshot with the abstract “Washed Away.” Now, she embraces the beat with telling ambivalence in “Happy Ending.” A double time breakbeat churns far below a vocal that starts out barely paying attention to the underlying propulsion. But as Kelela finds herself in a club and spots her ex, she latches onto the beat: “I won’t chase you but it’s not over,” she sings. “If you don’t run away, could be a happy ending after all.” Then they’re dancing together, and intertwined in a kiss. But the beat falls away, and the song leaves the situation entirely in suspense. PARELESiLe, ‘(Escapándome) de Mí’Romance is often toxic in the songs on “Nacarile,” the new album by the Puerto Rican songwriter iLe. “Everything beautiful about you scares me,” she sings in “(Escapándome) de Mí” (“Escaping Myself”). “It scares me because I like it.” As the track builds around her, from a lone plucked guitar to an electronic citadel, she recognizes her own vulnerability, ponders it and takes the leap anyway. PARELESOkay Kaya, ‘Inside of a Plum’The serene drift of “Inside of a Plum,” from Norwegian American indie artist Okay Kaya’s forthcoming album “SAP,” was inspired by doctor-administered ketamine therapy, which is sometimes used to treat depression. That might sound heavy, but Kaya Wilkins’s characteristically wry approach gives the song an alluring weightlessness and even a sense of humor. There’s an amusing mundanity to the way she describes the procedure (“in a building. in an office, in a chair under a weighted blanket”) and then a vivid psychedelia once her trip begins. Amid floating strings, Wilkins murmurs the song’s indelibly descriptive hook: “Now I’m scuba diving in space.” ZOLADZHagop Tchaparian, ‘Right to Riot’Hagop Tchaparian is a British-Armenian musician whose tastes have led him from playing guitar in the grungy 1990s band Symposium to the electronic music on his new album, “Bolts.” Through the years, Tchaparian has also gathered recordings of performances — live and in video clips — of Armenian and Middle Eastern music and gatherings. The first sounds that leap out of “Right to Riot” are traditional: an aggressive six-beat drum pattern and the nasal, biting snarl of what Armenians call the zurna, a double-reed instrument used under various names across the Balkans, the Middle East, northern Africa and western Asia. Programmed beats, synthesizer swoops, bass drones and layers of percussion only make the track bristle more intensely.

The New York Times;Joni Mitchell Reclaims Her Voice at Newport;The singer-songwriter’s surprise return to the stage at the folk festival she first played in 1967 was an act of bravery, joy and reinterpretation.;"This summer, quite unexpectedly, two of music’s brightest stars haven’t been fresh young upstarts, but a pair of semi-reclusive female elders whose brilliance is being reaffirmed by a new generation of fans.The 63-year-old pop legend Kate Bush’s 1985 anthem “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” is a legitimate contender for Song of the Summer — it currently sits at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, nestled between recent smashes from Harry Styles and Jack Harlow — thanks to its prominent use in the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things.” And on Sunday night, Joni Mitchell, 78, stunned attendees of the Newport Folk Festival (and the countless people who have since watched viral cellphone videos of the event) when she performed in public for the first time since her 2015 brain aneurysm, playing her first full-length live set since 2000.Acting as an ecstatic master of ceremonies, the 41-year-old musician Brandi Carlile asked the crowd to welcome her friend Mitchell “back to the Newport stage for the first time since 1969” — which was 12 years before Carlile was born.“Joni hasn’t always felt the appreciation that exists amongst humanity for her,” Carlile said in a CBS News interview, explaining her idea for a performance that would mimic the laid-back “Joni Jams” that Mitchell has for the past few years been hosting with peers and younger musicians in her Los Angeles living room. “But I wanted her to feel that.”Carlile has done plenty to help her friend and idol feel that love, and to assert Mitchell’s rightful place in the canon. “We didn’t live in the time of Shakespeare, Rembrandt or Beethoven,” Carlile said during one of the several recent concerts she’s given in which she’s performed Mitchell’s 1971 album “Blue” in its entirety. “But we live in the time of Joni Mitchell.”Especially since surviving that near-fatal aneurysm in 2015, Mitchell’s work has been enjoying a widespread critical reappraisal. (“Having a brush with death kind of softens people towards me,” she told CBS News with a chuckle.) In the past year, she has received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors and was named the Recording Academy’s MusiCares Person of the Year, as well as begun an ongoing project called the Joni Mitchell Archives, which will see her releasing rich collections of previously unheard music.Even though these recent accolades have brought Mitchell back into the public eye, the performance videos from Newport have had a rare and profound power. In some sense, they are simply reminders of the euphoric potential of live music, an experience that was all but silenced for many months during the pandemic.Beyond that, though, the past two-plus years of seemingly unending illness, sacrifice and loss have left so many people hungry for stories of resilience, hard-won strength and new beginnings. After the aneurysm, just as she did when she contracted polio at age 9, Mitchell had to teach herself to walk again. This time, though, she also had to rediscover her singing voice and relearn how to play the guitar — which she did, triumphantly, onstage at Newport during an instrumental performance of “Just Like This Train,” from her 1974 album “Court and Spark.”Before Mitchell picked up her guitar, Carlile prepped the audience, announcing, “She’s doing something very, very brave right now for you guys,” adding, “This is a trust fall, and she picked the right people to do this with.” Carlile was talking to the Newport crowd, but she might as well have been saying it to the other musicians onstage — including herself. Even when she was singing lead, tackling these complex songs with a soulful ease, Carlile’s gaze was attentively fixed on Mitchell, ready to catch her in case she stumbled but more often just letting Mitchell guide the way.There was an intergenerational tenderness to the performance, the way that some of the younger musicians (Marcus Mumford, Blake Mills, Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of Lucius) appeared to be in palpable awe of what was happening even as they kept time and in tune. The whole thing had a loose, communal spirit about it, too, reminiscent of the coffeehouses in which Mitchell got her start performing folk songs in the mid-1960s. The spotlight was shared (the singer and guitarist Celisse Henderson had a particular star turn when she sang lead on “Help Me”) but, as Mitchell sat regally in her high-backed, gilded chair positioned in the center of the stage, it was always apparent who was the one holding court.When Mitchell first came out onstage, she seemed a tad overwhelmed, clinging to her cane and backing up Carlile, who took the lead on a breezy, celebratory “Carey.” But over the course of that song, a visible change came over Mitchell. Her shoulders loosened. She began to shimmy. And all at once she seemed to regain her voice — her voice, sonorous and light, seeming to dance over those balletic melodies at a jazzy tempo all her own. She eventually relaxed enough to sing lead on several numbers, including a sumptuous version of George Gershwin’s “Summertime” that allowed her to luxuriate in her velvety lower register.The highlight of the set, though, was “Both Sides Now,” a song that Mitchell wrote before she played Newport for the first time in 1967, when she was in her early 20s. Back then, some critics scoffed at the lyrics’ presumptive wisdom: What could a girl in her 20s possibly know about both sides of life? But over the years, the song has revealed itself to contain fathomless depths that have only been audible in later interpretations.When she was 56, Mitchell rereleased a lush version of “Both Sides Now” on her 2000 album of the same name, backed by a 70-piece orchestra. Her voice was deeper, elegiac and elegantly weary. “It’s life’s illusions I recall,” she sang at the end of the song, “I really don’t know life at all.”That version was considered a tear-jerker (and used to this effect in a classic scene from the movie “Love, Actually”), but then again, it’s easy to find pathos in getting older. Aging inherently brings suffering, debilitation and loss — this is not news. What Mitchell’s 2022 performance of the song asserted was that it can also bring serendipity, long-delayed gratification and joy. Ever an expert re-interpreter of her own material, Mitchell breathed new meaning into some of her most famous lyrics. “I could drink a case of you, and I would still be on my feet,” she sang with Carlile, the line becoming not only a challenge to a lover, but a survivor’s boast to life itself.Part of what is so heartening about Mitchell’s recent pop cultural revival, like Bush’s surprise chart resurgence, is that it allows a beloved if somewhat underappreciated artist to receive her laurels while she’s still living. (Wynonna Judd, still grieving her mother Naomi’s death, was also onstage with Mitchell and wept openly throughout “Both Sides Now” — a visual reminder of a crueler fate and the inherent dichotomy of the song.) In a culture that excessively scrutinizes women as they age, or simply renders them invisible and erases their influence, it felt like a quietly radical act to honor Mitchell in this way. Younger artists got the chance to pay earnest homage to their elder; a mature woman who was not yet finished reinterpreting her life’s work reclaimed the stage.Surrounded by an adoring crowd of friends, fellow musicians, and admirers — many of whom were not yet born when Mitchell wrote “Both Sides Now” — she seemed to sing it this time with a grinning shrug: I really don’t know life at all. As if to say: You never know — anything can happen. Even this.";2022-07-26;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/arts/music/joni-mitchell-performance.html;2022-07-28;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESJONIMITCHELLRECLAIMSHERVOICEATNEWPORT
The New York Times;Anton Fier, Drummer Who Left Stamp on a Downtown Scene, Dies at 66;He worked with everyone from the Feelies to Herbie Hancock to Laurie Anderson, as well as leading the indie-rock supergroup the Golden Palominos. But there was a troubled side.;"Even at his musical peak in the 1980s, Anton Fier, a drummer, producer and bandleader who brought power and precision to his work with acts as diverse as the Feelies, Herbie Hancock, Laurie Anderson and his own star-studded ensemble, the Golden Palominos, seemed to glimpse a dark end for himself.The film and music critic Glenn Kenny, in an email, remembered running into Mr. Fier in the mid-1980s at the Hoboken, N.J., nightclub Maxwell’s, then a cauldron of indie rock, and querying him about alarming details on the sleeve of the Palominos’ album “Visions of Excess.”The rear cover featured a photograph of Mr. Fier, visibly drunk, quaffing a cocktail at a rock club. With it was an acknowledgment that read, “For Jim Gordon and Bonzo,” a reference to the Derek and the Dominos drummer who murdered his own mother during a psychotic episode, and to John Bonham, the Led Zeppelin drummer who died at 32 after consuming some 40 shots of vodka.Mr. Fier (pronounced feer) seemed to be hinting at his own grisly demise. “I don’t care,” Mr. Kenny recalled him saying. “I’m not going to live to be 35.”With anyone else, the episode might fit a familiar narrative — the self-destructive rocker in a death spiral. But throughout his life, friends said, Mr. Fier always resisted easy categorization.He was a punk-rock provocateur who could extemporize, seemingly for hours, about free-jazz pioneers and Ghanaian percussion luminaries; an artist with big ambitions and a web of platinum connections, but also a loner who shunned interviews and self-promotion; a prickly contrarian who seemed to revel in confrontation, but who was also known among friends for a kind, generous spirit.“Anton was kind of like a Tootsie Pop, with a hard exterior and a soft core,” the singer-songwriter Lianne Smith, a close friend who worked with him, said in a phone interview.Little wonder, then, that his death on Sept. 14 at 66 — confirmed by a cremation notice from a service in Basel, Switzerland — left as many questions as answers. The cause was rumored to be voluntary assisted dying, the location said to be in Switzerland, and suicide itself did not seem out of the question. Plagued by money troubles and waning career prospects, he had openly discussed the topic among friends in recent years. But where? When? How?He had certainly fallen on hard times. Dogged by money woes, lacking musical inspiration and, after injuring his wrists, hindered in playing drums to his own high standards, he had lost his only outlet. “He had a lot of pressures and a lot of anxieties,” Ms. Smith said. “But when he played music, he was a complete human being.”ImageMr. Fier in 1987. “Anton was kind of like a Tootsie Pop,” a friend and fellow musician said, “with a hard exterior and a soft core.”Credit...Rick McGinnisAnton John Fier III was born on June 20, 1956, in Cleveland, to Anton J. Fier Jr., an electrician and former Marine, and Ruthe Marie Fier. His parents split up when he was young, and Mr. Fier, who was known as Tony in his school days, endured a difficult relationship with his stepfather, a polka musician, he later told friends.Turning to music, he worked in a record store as a teenager and eventually drummed his way into the Cleveland proto-punk scene, recording with a version of the Styrenes and playing on the seminal 1978 EP “Datapanik in the Year Zero” by Pere Ubu, the conceptual band that calls its genre “avant garage.”Soon after, Mr. Fier followed his musical dreams to New York, where he brokered his encyclopedic knowledge of music into a job at the SoHo Music Gallery, a record store catering to the downtown music cognoscenti. There, he seemed more interested in chatting about records than selling them.Mr. Kenny recalled, “I remember walking in one day and these two cats” — Mr. Fier and the experimental saxophonist John Zorn, a fellow clerk — “were sitting up front talking about Charlie Parker, treating browsers like they were minor inconveniences.”Mr. Fier did more than talk about music. A gifted and ferocious drummer, he got his big break in 1978 when he answered an ad in The Village Voice placed by the Feelies, a cerebral indie group from New Jersey that The Voice had recently called the best underground band in New York. The group was looking for a drummer.“We asked the people who called what they thought of Moe Tucker,” Glenn Mercer, the band’s guitarist and vocalist, said, referring to the Velvet Underground’s drummer. “We were thinking in terms of very simple, primitive drumming. I think he was the only one that even knew who she was.”With a bookish air and a subversive sensibility, Mr. Fier fit the ethos of the band. His explosive drumming helped fuel the group’s first album, “Crazy Rhythms,” which the critic Robert Christgau later described as “exciting in a disturbingly abstract way, or maybe disturbing in an excitingly abstract way.”But Mr. Fier’s personality proved explosive as well, making his tenure with the band a short one. As the Feelies pulled up to a gig at one club, where the line was around the block, he gushed about how thrilled he was to be in the band. After a raucous set that had the packed house cheering, his mood inexplicably turned.“When the show was over, he was like, ‘You guys are so controlling, I can’t believe it,’” Mr. Mercer recalled Mr. Fier saying. “Just like that, a 180.”ImageMr. Fier with the Golden Palominos in 2012.Credit...Christopher Gregory for The New York TimesEven so, Mr. Fier’s career continued to flourish. He joined the Lounge Lizards, John Lurie’s avant-jazz combo, for their first album, released in 1981, before Mr. Lurie rose to fame as an archetype of New York cool with his roles in Jim Jarmusch’s indie films “Stranger Than Paradise” and “Down by Law.”His career rose to new heights in the mid-1980s: He toured with the jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock following Mr. Hancock’s 1984 pop-funk crossover hit “Rockit,” and played on Laurie Anderson’s acclaimed 1984 album, “Mister Heartbreak.”By that point his musical ambitions could not be contained behind the drum kit, so Mr. Fier formed the Golden Palominos, an ever-evolving indie-rock supergroup that attracted a parade of guest stars, including Michael Stipe, John Lydon and Richard Thompson, through the rest of the 1980s and into the ’90s.“The band revolved around anyone Anton liked at the time,” Syd Straw, the iconoclastic singer-songwriter who got her start with the group, said by phone. “He had pretty bizarre social skills, but he was a magnet for brainy musicians. I think that he was, at heart, an amazing casting director.”In whatever musical role, Mr. Fier was exacting. “He never ‘settled,’’’ Chris Stamey, a founder of the indie band the dB’s who performed with the Palominos, recalled in an email. “And this could be unsettling at times. But we all wanted to see that blissful smile when something finally met his high standards.”Through the 2000s and early 2010s, Mr. Fier began to focus more on producing, working on albums by Ms. Smith, Julia Brown and the guitarist Jim Campilongo, although he did continue to perform with a highly regarded combo headed by the singer, guitarist and bassist Tony Scherr, a former Lounge Lizard.He also quit alcohol, a habit that had grown prodigious, particularly since the hard-partying Hancock tour, Mr. Stamey said.Hounded by creditors, however, Mr. Fier drifted further and further off the grid, avoiding even banks. He seemed to conclude, in eerily analytical fashion, that life was no longer worth living. Ms. Smith said he told her that he wanted to “fly to Thailand, have a wonderful vacation, take a lot of drugs and walk into the ocean.”The pandemic seemed only to deepen his despair. Without work or family (his only marriage, in 1976, lasted less than a year), he began researching his options. Last fall, Mr. Stamey recalled, Mr. Fier told him that he had been burned when he paid $900 over the internet for a veterinary tranquilizer, which he had decided “was the most peaceful way to go.”A few months ago, Mr. Fier texted his friend J.P. Olsen, a filmmaker and musician who had recently moved to Indiana, asking him for his new address. Mr. Fier had some boxes he wanted to send him. On Sept. 21, word began circulating that he was dead, apparently from an assisted suicide in Switzerland. Four days later, Mr. Olsen received the boxes, which were filled with piles of Mr. Fier’s clothes.And on Oct. 1, Nicky Skopelitis, a Palominos guitarist and the executor of Mr. Fier’s estate, received the cremation notice, dated Sept. 14, along with Mr. Fier’s remains.Questions about his last days linger. But in a way, friends said, that seems fitting for a man who was only too comfortable with loose ends.Two years ago, Mr. Stamey urged Mr. Fier to write a memoir, to pull him out of his funk. Mr. Fier’s response, Mr. Stamey recalled, was curt: “He said that he wanted to be the only one who didn’t write a book.”If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

The New York Times;Olivia Newton-John: That Headband Was a Crown;When the singer smudged her classy image, she “unlocked something new that shot her to the top of pop’s Olympus,” our critic writes: “The vestal vamp.”;"We would’ve just called her ONJ now. But part of the appeal, I think, was all of that name, the possible royalty of it. Nobody wanted to waste a syllable. Olivia Newton-John. Just saying it might bestow a crown. The rest of her allure sprang from that classiness: She was neither queen nor first lady of anything, yet she seemed, ultimately, like … a lady. And that was something she could have some fun with, a category she could smudge. Eventually. I mean, this was a person who, at the heights of funk, disco and glam rock, recorded six country-esque albums, throw pillows for your ears. And most of their singles topped what was once known as Billboard’s easy listening chart. (So maybe she was the queen of that.)By the end of the 1970s, though, she had figured out the whole “lady” thing and spent 90 percent of her first Hollywood movie disguised that way, as a princess. There’s a lot going on in “Grease.” Most of it’s bizarre and has to do with sex and a sort of pure whiteness, particularly how, in both cases, Newton-John, who died on Monday at 73, was holding onto hers. Not for John Travolta, per se, but for “You’re the One That I Want,” the duet with Travolta (and a triple-X bass line) that ends the movie. The virginal bobby-soxer Newton-John had been playing was now in pumps and skintight black pants. Her hair had expanded from Sandra Dee to Sophia Loren. You could see her shoulders.That transformation unlocked something new that shot her to the top of pop’s Olympus: the vestal vamp. Nothing about the presentation of a four-minute pop song would be the same. Neither would anybody who sat through a dozen showings of “Grease.” The only reason my 5- and 6- and 10-year-old selves put up with it at all was the knowledge that we’d soon get to the part at the amusement park where Olivia Newton-John turns into an ONJ.ImageIn the movie “Grease,” Sandy (Newton-John, left) transforms into a sexpot to get back together with Danny, played by John Travolta.Credit...Paramount PicturesI didn’t learn much from Newton-John about sex. Only that its existence was there to be implied and winked at. It’s true that her pelvis was, at last, affixed to Travolta’s near the end of “Grease” but on a redundant ride called the Shake Shack. And, yeah, she does spend that zany video for “Physical” in a disco spa studded with Adonic gym rats, but when the tanned, fatless men walk off hand-in-hand, she gleefully locks arms with one of the spa’s tubbier clients. They’re the ones she wants — and, consequently, the ones I wanted, too.The videos, the hit songs, her lip-syncing them on “Solid Gold”: I also wanted Olivia Newton-John. And one of my parents must have known this because there was a copy of her second greatest hits LP, from 1982, at our house. And knowing what my parents weren’t listening to, the only reason it would’ve been there is for me; I wasn’t even 7. The thing about that album — more than any I’d ever studied up to then, except for Stevie Wonder’s “Hotter Than July” (you could see his shoulders) — is the gatefold, a good album’s second strongest intoxicant. And this one was just Newton-John in a horizontal display, head to thigh, hair shortish and characteristically a-feather. White knit top, tight white pants, some gold jewelry. Was she truly on her back or simply shot to look that way? I’d have to wait a whole two months, for the gatefold of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” (not a dissimilar pose but with a tiger cub), to see anything as mesmerizingly erotic.Newton-John revamped herself at the dawn of the music-video era. She knew the power of the art form — her Grammy-winning 1982 video album, “Olivia Physical,” was the “Lemonade” of its day, inspiring a prime-time network TV event. She only had to toy with going too far. Her real thing was limitations. She seemed to know what hers were — as a vocalist, as a dancer, as an actor. And she luxuriated in them. There was nothing inherently subversive about her. Yet she was an ironist — the person you’d least expect to see, say, mounting a fat dude on a massage table and riding him like a mechanical bull. Even when she was straining for eros — the way she was in the video for “Tied Up,” in a red leather vest, her mouth seemingly in want of irrigation — you were watching an angel pursue a dirty face.That’s the reason she survived “Xanadu” — the musical belch, from 1980, with her as a Greek muse on roller skates: an imperviousness to the surrounding absurdity. It’s the reason she came to embody the sleek fantasies of pleasure, painlessness and profit of the 1980s. Nothing disturbed her. She disturbed no one. Even that gatefold: She’s fully clothed! The skates and spandex were a prop and a metaphor. And “Physical” remained the decade’s longest-running No. 1 song.ImageGene Kelly, left, and Newton-John in the movie “Xanadu,” from 1980.Credit...Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBut at some point, she stopped perking us up. Well, we stopped letting her. Madonna had come along and threatened to put her out of business. I swore she was a parody of Newton-John’s flirty, jolly, heaven-sent persona; of her being staunchly white while adjacent to a wealth of Black and Latin music. What would it mean to mean it, not just to get dirty but to be dirty, to mix in some of that Blackness and brownness? “Like a Virgin,” for instance, is Newton-John but more ornately ironic, authentically, imaginatively lewd. Even though Newton-John’s hit machine was still going by 1985, she was already becoming a memory of a kind of innocence. Which is to say that she was never, ever forgotten. She’s a place pop music has been trying to get back to: the Stacey Q’s and Cathy Dennises, the Carly Rae Jepsens and Dua Lipas; the one and only Kylie Minogue.What I like to go back to with Olivia Newton-John isn’t her body at all. It’s her singing. There’s always more to it than I remember. I was putting it in sundresses and leotards. But, boy, that voice could work a singlet, too: She learned to flex her soprano so that it bent, barked, yipped and squealed. “Totally Hot,” from 1978, occasionally features sounds more typical for Sea World. Yet any deficiencies in soulfulness were repaid in spirit.She also perfected a great trick: layering. Instead of just one of her, suddenly, in a pre-chorus or a chorus-chorus, there was a fleet, of lilting, undulating, rainbowing, billowing, Bee Gee-ing selves, on “Have You Never Been Mellow,” on “A Little More Love,” on “Magic.” She had but one body, but on a record, she could become a multitude. The warmth of that sound; the glorious blue-sky of it still warrants exclamation — like “oh my lord” but alternatively divine. I like “ONJ.”";2022-08-05;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/arts/music/olivia-newton-john-grease-physical.html;2022-08-10;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESOLIVIANEWTON-JOHN:THATHEADBANDWASACROWN
The New York Times;Jerry Allison, Who Played Drums With Buddy Holly, Dies at 82;An original Cricket, he was also a co-writer of two signature Holly songs, “That’ll Be the Day” and “Peggy Sue.”;"Jerry Allison, who played drums with Buddy Holly and was a co-writer of two of his signature late-1950s songs, “That’ll Be the Day” and “Peggy Sue,” died on Monday at his home near Nashville. He was 82.Peter Bradley Jr., board director of the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation, confirmed the death.Mr. Allison was still a teenager in Lubbock, Texas, when he began playing with Mr. Holly, who was three years older and had already made a tentative start on a music career, releasing a few records in Nashville that did not do well. Back in Lubbock, he, Mr. Allison, Niki Sullivan on guitar (soon replaced by Sonny Curtis, Tommy Allsup and others) and Joe B. Mauldin on bass began honing a sound that drew on Elvis Presley and on country and, especially, Black music.“We’d have to listen to a radio station out of Shreveport, La., to hear the real blues — rhythm and blues — we wanted to hear,” Mr. Allison told The Globe-Gazette of Mason City, Iowa, in 1989. “Groups like Etta James and the Peaches, and the Midnighters and the Clovers. That wasn’t common music around Lubbock, but that was the kind of music we were trying to write.”At first, things were slow.“We’d be playing at things like supermarket openings,” Mr. Allison told The Lansing State Journal of Michigan in 1979. “Sometimes we’d get as much as $10 apiece.”Then, in May 1956, he and Mr. Holly went to see a new John Wayne movie, “The Searchers,” in which one of Mr. Wayne’s most memorable lines was “That’ll be the day.”Days later, according to an account written for the Library of Congress, Mr. Holly suggested that he and Mr. Allison write a song together, and Mr. Allison, imitating the Wayne line, said, “That’ll be the day.”“Right away, Buddy starts fiddling around with it,” Mr. Allison told the Lansing newspaper. “In about a half-hour, we had it.”Mr. Holly cut a country version of the song in Nashville that was unloved (a producer there is said to have called it “the worst song I’ve ever heard”), but in 1957 he and the Crickets, as his Lubbock group was called, recorded a rock ’n’ roll version that became a national hit and remained in Billboard’s Top 30 for three months. Mr. Holly, Mr. Allison and the producer who recorded that version, Norman Petty, got the songwriting credit, and in 2005 the record was selected for the Library of Congress’s National Recording Registry.Another touchstone song of early rock ’n’ roll appeared later in 1957, this time released under Mr. Holly’s name: “Peggy Sue.” Mr. Holly and the band were in Mr. Petty’s studio trying to record a song called “Cindy Lou,” but Mr. Allison, hoping to solidify his relationship with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Peggy Sue Gerron, suggested a name change.In her autobiography, “Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?” (2008), she described hearing the song for the first time when the Crickets played a show in Sacramento, Calif., where she was going to school. It was a complete surprise to her, and it ignited the crowd.“My heart pounded, and my cheeks were on fire,” she wrote. “With people all around me bouncing, swaying and singing my name over and over, I sank down in my seat, covered my face with my hands, and cried out to myself, ‘What have y’all done to me?’”Apparently she got over her shock; she and Mr. Allison later married. The marriage eventually ended in divorce, but “Peggy Sue” lives on as a rock ’n’ roll classic.Mr. Holly’s career was a short one; he died in a plane crash in 1959 — “the day the music died,” as Don McLean later sang in “American Pie.” Mr. Allison, though, kept performing and recording with an ever-changing lineup of Crickets for decades.“I don’t mind being called an oldie,” he told The Tulsa World of Oklahoma in 1996, “because we are.”ImageThe Crickets in 1958. From left, Mr. Allison, Mr. Holly and Mr. Mauldin.Credit...Everett CollectionJerry Ivan Allison was born on Aug. 31, 1939, in Hillsboro, Texas. He started playing drums at an early age.In a 2005 interview with The Sunday News of Lancaster, Pa., he said the name the Crickets came about because Mr. Holly liked an R&B group called the Spiders. At his house one day, he said, he and Mr. Holly started thumbing through an encyclopedia’s section on insects.They rejected “Beetles,” he said, because beetles were something people stepped on. Mr. Allison said he suggested “Crickets” because they “make a happy sound.”Mr. Allison eventually settled on a farm near Nashville. His survivors include his wife, Joanie Allison. His ex-wife, Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, died in 2018.Buddy Holly and the Crickets had a lasting influence on rock ’n’ roll. The band helped establish the classic rock four-piece: two guitarists, drummer, bassist. And it helped inspire another four-piece that did pretty well.“Paul McCartney did tell me that if there hadn’t been the Crickets, there never would have been the Beatles,” Mr. Allison told The Associated Press in 2013. Mr. McCartney sang backup, played some piano and produced the title track of the Crickets’ 1988 album, “T Shirt.”Mr. Allison also thought the group, which generally kept its songs pretty simple, encouraged youngsters to take up the instruments of rock.“When we went out on tour, we sounded just like our records,” he told the Lansing newspaper. “And whenever kids were starting a group, our songs were some that they knew they could do.”";2022-08-24;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/arts/music/jerry-allison-dead.html;2022-08-28;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESJERRYALLISON,WHOPLAYEDDRUMSWITHBUDDYHOLLY,DIESAT82
The New York Times;A Revival of ‘The Who’s Tommy’ Seeks a New Generation of Followers;In staging the storied rock opera in Chicago, its creators argue that the show’s exploration of celebrity worship and childhood trauma is more relevant than ever.;Thirty years ago, when the Who’s 1969 concept album “Tommy” was transformed into a rock opera for Broadway, it was hailed as a triumph of the form — a production that had finally managed to authentically marry theater and rock ’n’ roll.Fueled by the spiritual exploration of a 23-year-old Pete Townshend, the Who guitarist and songwriter, the original production of “Tommy” drew crowds of baby boomers primed with adolescent nostalgia for the story of a boy who discovers a superhuman aptitude for pinball despite not being able to see, hear or speak.The Broadway show raked in a record number of ticket sales the day after opening night, ran for nearly 900 performances and won five Tony Awards, including one for its director, Des McAnuff.With its depictions of rebellion against authority and analogies to spiritual enlightenment, the show was firmly rooted in the youth culture of the 1960s. So why would McAnuff, for whom “Tommy” was a career-defining success, take the risk of reimagining the work for today’s audiences?“Sometimes you just don’t get things out of your system,” McAnuff said in an interview shortly after his new production of “The Who’s Tommy” opened last month at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. “I felt like it was time to make it contemporary.”In resurrecting “Tommy,” McAnuff and Townshend, who wrote the book together, sought to prove that the work was not simply of an era, but carried the promise of timelessness.In 2023, McAnuff argues, Tommy’s transformation from catatonic schoolboy to a kind of charismatic cult leader resonates even more strongly when considering the modern-day culture of celebrity worship. And the show’s exploration of trauma — including post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual abuse and bullying — is something that audiences now have a much deeper understanding of.The reimagining of “Tommy” is not so much in story but in style, with McAnuff opting for futuristic austerity over 1960s nostalgia. Tommy displays his skill not on a kitschy pinball machine but a spare set piece (designed by David Korins) in which the outline of a machine is represented by narrow panels of light. The personality cult that encircles Tommy feels more sinister than in the original production.ImageA 1972 concert staging of “Tommy” at the Rainbow Theater in London brought together, from far left, Merry Clayton (whose back is to the camera), Peter Sellers, Sandy Denny, Graham Bell, Steve Winwood and Roger Daltrey.Credit...Getty ImagesThe production, which runs through Aug. 6, has received rave reviews in Chicago, with the critic Chris Jones of The Chicago Tribune calling it a “ready-for-prime-time stunner.” The Goodman says the show is on track to be its highest-grossing production ever, a boon for the organization during a time of high anxiety around regional theater’s post-pandemic return. The show’s commercial producer, Stephen Gabriel, said several options for the production’s future are being weighed, including a Broadway run.The story at the center of this production is much the same as the one the Who told when it played its new album at Woodstock in 1969.A 4-year-old Tommy watches as his father — a British Army captain believed to have died while on duty — shows up at the family’s home, ultimately killing the mother’s new lover during the ensuing fight. Tommy then loses his senses, becoming the victim of sexual abuse by his uncle, relentless bullying by his cousin and medical exploitation by an army of invasive doctors. After the world discovers his stunning talent for pinball, he becomes a messiah-like figure with a band of devoted followers.Whether “Tommy” can become a national phenomenon again, and not just a nostalgic tribute, depends, in part, on its ability to capture a new audience.McAnuff sees Ali Louis Bourzgui, the 23-year-old lead, as the show’s “doorway to Gen Z” — though not long out of college and largely unknown, he is viewed by the director as a natural star who will be appealing to a new generation of prospective “Tommy” fans.To Bourzgui, Tommy’s meteoric rise has parallels to the frenzy over certain social media influencers, artists or tech gurus.“He gets filled up by his followers,” Bourzgui said. “He keeps feeding off that, getting more gluttonous with power, until he realizes they’re following him because they want to feed off his trauma.”Bourzgui was born 30 years after the release of “Tommy” the album, but he has his own memory of his first listen — to the vinyl, in fact — in a friend’s apartment his freshman year. He remembers feeling moved by the music, if not a little bit befuddled by the plot. (McAnuff likes to call the story a “fable,” gesturing at the suspension of disbelief required to accept Tommy’s arc from silent child to pinball wizard to cult leader.)In preparation for the role, Bourzgui pored over performance videos of the Who on YouTube, finding himself in awe of the band’s magnetism. Wary of falling into mimicry, he hasn’t watched videos of the earlier production.“We’re not in the business of presenting museum pieces,” said Roche Schulfer, the Goodman’s executive director, who was approached about staging “Tommy” before the pandemic upended the theater world.Schulfer was persuaded by McAnuff and Townshend’s ideas for an update as well as their consideration of how certain themes and language might translate onstage today.ImageThe Who performing “Tommy” in Los Angeles in August 1989. Des McAnuff developed the show for the stage in the early 1990s.Credit...Ebet Roberts/Redferns, via Getty ImagesThe question is one that theater makers across the country are grappling with: Should revived works be altered to align with the worldviews and sensitivities of present-day audiences?In “Tommy,” McAnuff and Townshend’s answer was, largely, no.For example, the lyrics “deaf, dumb and blind” are central to some of the album’s hits, including its most famous: “Pinball Wizard.” When Townshend originally wrote “Tommy” in the 1960s, the word “dumb” was commonly used to refer to someone who was nonverbal, but it is now considered to be an offensive and archaic term. McAnuff said that he and Townshend did not seriously consider changing that language, viewing it as too much of a lyrical departure in foundational songs such as “Amazing Journey.”“‘Sensory impaired’ — I don’t think it would work,” McAnuff said. “I think it’s a song that has a certain amount of pedigree and dignity.”The story behind the concept, Townshend told an interviewer in the 1970s, came from his devotion in his early 20s to the writings of the Indian spiritual leader Meher Baba — also an inspiration for one of the Who’s biggest hits, “Baba O’Riley” — who taught, as he put it, that as humans, “there are whole chunks of life, including the whole concept of reality, which escapes us.”Over the years, Townshend has described the character of Tommy as autistic, explaining that his condition was a metaphor for humanity’s limited view of reality.Revivals over the years, including one by McAnuff a decade ago in Ontario, Canada, have given the book writers the opportunity to re-examine the show’s handling of sensitive issues. Around that time, Townshend acknowledged in an interview that the rock opera does not allow for explanation or discussion around serious issues such as sexual abuse, but that audiences can consider those topics themselves in a modern context.“We have to live with the rock opera version that we did 20 years ago,” Townshend said at the time. “We also have to live with the fact that ‘Tommy’ started as a rock opera in 1968, ’69. And yet times have changed. Attitudes have changed.”In the 1990s, McAnuff, who first developed the show at La Jolla Playhouse in California, staged the sexual abuse scene in such a way that had little need for alterations today. A revolving bed suggests the violation without any significant physical touch — an approach the director views as key to protecting the child actors involved in the show.After the Broadway debut, there were some complaints that the scene was less daring than the one in Ken Russell’s provocative 1975 film, to which McAnuff responded, “That’s a real little boy up there. Does anyone actually need me to abuse that child to get the idea across?”The most significant change in the Chicago production on the issue of abuse is the removal of a short song, “Tommy’s Holiday Camp,” that brings back the sexually abusive uncle in a way that no longer seemed necessary, McAnuff said. There is also some toned-down staging in “The Acid Queen,” the wailing barnburner — performed by Tina Turner in the film version — in which Tommy’s father takes him to a prostitute and con artist who promises to cure his condition with drugs.Without being too heavy handed in any moralistic messaging, McAnuff hopes the audience sees what the intent of the work has been since the beginning.“At the end of the day, we portray what happens to him not to condone it but to condemn it,” McAnuff said. “And I think that’s the point of view of the whole piece.”;2023-07-12;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/theater/the-whos-tommy-goodman-chicago.html;2023-07-16;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESAREVIVALOF‘THEWHO’STOMMY’SEEKSANEWGENERATIONOFFOLLOWERS
The New York Times;‘The Idol’ Season Finale Recap: What Was the Point?;The season finale, like the rest of the series, had little of substance to say about either pop music or power dynamics.;“The Idol” has concluded its five-episode run, and there’s one question I can’t help but ask: What was the point of all of that?The season finale of the series from Sam Levinson, Reza Fahim and the star Abel Tesfaye (the Weeknd) had shockingly little to say about either pop music or power dynamics. Well, maybe not shockingly. Nothing in the first four episodes suggested that there was going to be some brilliant revelation in the eleventh hour, but a girl could hope that we might get a bit more than an underwhelming ending in which the baffling character known as Tedros Tedros is both exposed for the creep that he is and ultimately forgiven by Lily-Rose Depp’s heroine, Jocelyn.Sure, if you want to, you can argue that there is a transference of who has the upper hand in their relationship. In the finale, Tedros’s back story as a pimp has been publicly revealed in a Vanity Fair article planted by Jocelyn’s manager Chaim. Tedros loses his club and is apparently being investigated by the I.R.S. And yet Jocelyn gives him a pass to her tour date at SoFi Stadium. Backstage he receives a strongly worded warning from her other manager, Destiny, before being embraced by Jocelyn.“None of this means as much without you,” she says. And then she introduces him onstage to about 70,000 screaming fans as “the love of my life.”We are ostensibly supposed to read this as Jocelyn now being in control. In her dressing room he looks at the wooden hairbrush she claimed her mother used to beat her. “It’s brand-new,” he says, realizing that she had deceived him. She addresses her fans as “angels,” the very thing he called her. And, after they make out in front of that audience, she tells him, “You’re mine forever. Now go stand over there.”Are we supposed to believe it was all a ruse on Jocelyn’s part? That she used her own story of abuse to manipulate him? That’s what I think Levinson and Tesfaye are getting at, but it’s more confusing than anything. If Jocelyn were a real pop star, aligning herself with a man who went to prison for holding a woman hostage would tank her career. That’s not power — that’s a man’s idea of what power looks like for a woman.But let’s back up for a second. For most of this episode it looks like Jocelyn is going to fully kick Tedros to the curb, a conclusion which would have been predictable but at least more satisfying than this one.Angry that their meeting was not organic but instead a product of his scheming, she calls him a “con man and a fraud.” She has a plan to take over his empire of young talent by making them all her tour openers. When her team arrives for a meeting about whether this endeavor is going to happen, Jocelyn has all the scantily clad singers put on a performance for the label. Despite initial skepticism, everyone is impressed by the vocals and the grinding. They are less so by Tedros, who is wasted and belligerent.At this point, it is unclear what it would take for Jocelyn to kick the patently useless Tedros out of her house. But we get the answer when it comes out that her ex-boyfriend Rob has been accused of sexual assault. The charge comes thanks to the photo that Xander orchestrated in the previous episode, which placed Rob in a compromising position with one of Tedros’s followers.Upon hearing the news, Jocelyn immediately recognizes it as Tedros’s doing and finally orders Chaim to take care of him. Chaim obliges, with Hank Azaria chewing his way through a monologue about Little Red Riding Hood. Meanwhile, Jocelyn performs a sexualized interpretive dance to one of her new songs as proof of concept for the tour.But once Tedros is gone, Jocelyn is back to being bored. She swims. She trains. She smokes, morosely. Fast forward to six weeks later: The tour is already underway, and the disgraced Tedros is invited back into the fold, much to the dismay of the suits who thought they had rid themselves of him for good.And that brings me back to the question of what “The Idol” wanted to accomplish. Speaking with The New York Times before the series debuted on HBO, Tesfaye said his pitch was “about celebrity culture and how much power they have.” But we never really see Jocelyn wield her celebrity power. Tedros may be hers “forever,” but she is still clearly beholden to him as evidenced by the fact that she welcomes him back.So I’m left believing that what Levinson and Tesfaye thought they were creating was a messed up love story, in the style of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread.” In that 2017 film, Anderson pulls off a switcheroo in which a demanding mentor is dominated by his adoring pupil. But over the course of that 130-minute movie we come to understand much more about the central couple than we do over five hours of “The Idol.”That is the greatest failing of “The Idol”: After all of this, I still don’t know what drives Jocelyn and Tedros. Music, I guess? But I have trouble believing even they care all that much.Liner notesHow does an entire tour get put together in six weeks on the basis of three singles? Yes, presumably some of it was in the works before Tedros came along, but these things are monstrous undertakings and Jocelyn has been a little preoccupied.What other songs is she going to sing during her set? One of the show’s biggest oversights is that we have no sense of who Jocelyn was as an artist before her crisis.One moment Nikki is trying to recruit Tedros and then the next she’s laughing about his demise. It is totally baffling character behavior. (Similarly, I still don’t understand why Xander has any allegiance to Tedros, unless he is supposed to be literally brainwashed.)Justice for Leia, the one character with any sense. I wonder what was in her note to Jocelyn.Nikki briefly mentions that Andrew Finkelstein’s employees walked out to protest Jocelyn’s misogynistic music. That seems like a bit of an attempt to acknowledge the potential backlash to the series, which has already come and gone.Will there be a Season 2? I have a hard time imagining what that would even look like unless Jocelyn and Tedros turn into Bonnie and Clyde. But don’t get any ideas, please, HBO.;2023-07-03;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/03/arts/television/the-idol-season-finale-recap.html;2023-07-05;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMES‘THEIDOL’SEASONFINALERECAP:WHATWASTHEPOINT?
The New York Times;David Bowie, and His Personas, Will Live On at Victoria and Albert Museum;The London museum will house more than 80,000 items from the star’s music career at a new David Bowie Center for the Study of Performing Arts. It will open in 2025.;"Over a 55-year career, David Bowie redefined the essence of cool by embracing an outsider status. Now, Ziggy Stardust and all of the musician’s other personas will have a permanent home.The Victoria and Albert Museum in London will house more than 80,000 items from Bowie’s career at a new David Bowie Center for the Study of Performing Arts, the museum announced on Thursday. The center, which will be at a new outpost of the museum called the V&A East Storehouse at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the Stratford section of London, will open in 2025.“With David’s life’s work becoming part of the U.K.’s national collections, he takes his rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses,” Bowie’s estate said in a statement. “David’s work can be shared with the public in ways that haven’t been possible before, and we’re so pleased to be working closely with the V&A to continue to commemorate David’s enduring cultural influence.”Bowie died in 2016, two days after his 69th birthday.In a statement, the museum said that the acquisition and the creation of the center had been made possible by a combined donation of 10 million pounds (about $12 million) from the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group, adding that the donation would support “the ongoing conservation, research and study of the archive.” Warner Music bought Bowie’s entire songwriting catalog last year.Beyond 70,000 images of Bowie taken by the likes of Terry O’Neill, Brian Duffy and Helmut Newton, the collection includes letters, sheet music, original costumes, fashion, other photography, film, music videos, set designs, instruments, album artwork, awards, and of course, fashion.Many of those will be familiar to fans: Bowie’s ensembles worn as his alter ego, Ziggy Stardust; Kansai Yamamoto’s costumes for the “Aladdin Sane” tour in 1973; the Union Jack coat designed by Bowie and the British designer Alexander McQueen for the 1997 “Earthling” album cover.Handwritten lyrics for songs like “Fame,” Heroes” and “Ashes to Ashes” will also be on display, including examples of Bowie’s cut-up technique. The artist looked to William S. Burroughs, the postmodern author, as inspiration to cut up written text and rearrange it into lyrics.ImageCut-up lyrics for “Blackout” from “Heroes,” recorded in 1977 by David Bowie.Credit...The David Bowie ArchiveIn 1997, Bowie told The Times that he worked with that method “about 40 percent of the time,” which, in that year, meant using a Macintosh computer.“I feed into it the fodder, and it spews out reams of paper with these arbitrary combinations of words and phrases,” he said.Bowie’s personal writing and “intimate notebooks from every year of Bowie’s life and career” and “unrealized projects” will also be on display, many of which have never been made available to the public, the museum said.The permanent collection comes 10 years after the museum created “David Bowie Is,” a vast survey that traced the beginnings of David Jones, a saxophone and blues player growing up in London, as he became David Bowie, a transcendent figure in music, art and fashion. The traveling exhibit made its final stop in 2018 in New York, the city Bowie called home at the end of his life.“I believe everyone will agree with me when I say that when I look back at the last 60 years of post-Beatles music, that if only one artist could be in the V&A it should be David Bowie,” Nile Rodgers, a longtime collaborator, said in a statement. “He didn’t just make art.

The New York Times;The Endless Pop Shimmers of the Weeknd;“Dawn FM” extends and reimagines Abel Tesfaye’s fixation on perfect pop that he’s been chasing since the mid-2010s.;There’s not a moment to breathe on the new album by the Weeknd, “Dawn FM” — no spaces for resolution and calm, no indications of a world outside of its borders. An uninterrupted set of iridescent megapop anthems blended like a D.J. mix, it is, as with so many things that he has made in the last decade, an all-or-nothing proposition.Since the Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, first arrived in 2011 with a trio of dank, sleazy mixtapes that radically reconstructed R&B, he has steadfastly, maybe even stubbornly, committed to thinking of his albums as discrete eras with evolving ideologies. And as he’s become one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, this has required both tremendous skill and a not insignificant amount of faith — in an era of microtargeting and niches that explode into ubiquity, he is choosing a far less assured top-down path.He has succeeded by remaining, even at peak saturation, enigmatic. Tesfaye, 31, is interested in world-building, and he remains obscure — at this point, evolving past strategic anonymity into full-scale character work — hiding behind hits.“Dawn FM,” his fifth major-label album, is sleek and vigorous and also, again, a light reimagining of what big-tent music might sound like now, in an era when most global stars have abandoned the concept. “Dawn FM” extends and reimagines Tesfaye’s fixation on perfect pop that he’s been pursuing since he first teamed with the hitmaker Max Martin in the mid-2010s — seven years later, he’s still chasing a deeply polished orb at the end of an infinite galaxy.What’s striking is the path he’s chosen to get there — yes, Martin is here, as are Oscar Holter and Swedish House Mafia. But Tesfaye’s true consigliere is Daniel Lopatin (a.k.a Oneohtrix Point Never), who began his career as a channeler of interstellar rumble but evolved into a soundtracker for space disco. Together, they make work that is mesmeric, both for its quality and its seamlessness. Tesfaye pulls Lopatin closer to blunt rhythm while allowing himself to get absorbed in the producer’s endless shimmers.On “Dawn FM,” they land squarely in the window between 1982 and 1984, when New York’s emergent hip-hop production was coalescing into the electro that was streaking its way into pop. This is breakdancing music, touching on everything from Afrika Bambaataa’s seminal “Planet Rock” to Man Parrish and Mantronix to the first Force M.D.s album to the tuneful Los Angeles proto-rap of Egyptian Lover and World Class Wreckin’ Cru to Maurice Starr and Arthur Baker’s early work with New Edition.What Tesfaye and Lopatin build on that foundation is ambitious. “Don’t Break My Heart” is soaringly sad, framing romantic desperation as an unescapable sonic maze. “Gasoline” dips into Depeche Mode-style hauteur for a classic Weeknd story about alluring degeneracy: “It’s 5 a.m. I’m high again/And you can see that I’m in pain/I’ve fallen into emptiness.”“How Do I Make You Love Me?” is a super-sweet version of the Michael Jackson-esque pop Tesfaye has been reaching for, as is the majestic “Take My Breath.” These songs, which appear back to back early on the album, are the best arguments for Tesfaye’s vision, and crucially, both are songs where Martin is there as an amplifying force.On “Dawn FM,” Tesfaye occasionally edges up against simu-funk, like on “Sacrifice,” which samples Alicia Myers’s dance-liberation thumper “I Want to Thank You.” And “Here We Go … Again,” which has the faintest mist of “How Deep Is Your Love” by the Bee Gees, is the album’s weakest and least characteristic moment, a lyrical jolt into the deeply specific present for a performer who is trying to make music that exists outside of time.There’s a reason no one is currently trying to emulate what Tesfaye is achieving — it requires the meticulousness of an engineer, the ego of a superstar and the scars of the deeply wounded. Done wrong, it can come off as icy and algorithmic.The album is threaded with interstitials from a fictional radio station, mainly voiced by Jim Carrey — amusing but not particularly meaningful. What does hit harder is “A Tale by Quincy,” in which the influential producer and mogul Quincy Jones relates a story about learning to grow up rough. Jones is an obvious antecedent for Tesfaye, who aspires to be an orchestrator as much as a singer and songwriter. (There are echoes of Jones’s 1981 album “The Dude” here as well.)If anything has changed for Tesfaye, it’s his relationship to dysfunction. Though there are moments — like “Sacrifice” (“The ice inside my veins will never bleed”) and “Gasoline” — that recall the louche desperation of his early albums, he’s more often the victim.“I Heard You’re Married” — which features a crisp, dexterous guest verse from Lil Wayne (“If I ain’t your husband I can’t be your hybrid”) — is about what happens when your old weapons are turned against you: “Your number in my phone I’m gon’ delete it/Girl, I’m way too grown for that deceiving.” “Is There Someone Else?” is a remarkably chill song about being a reformed cad. And he boasts about a movie-star girlfriend on “Here We Go … Again.”Perhaps the shift is an acknowledgment of the regrets that come with age and experience. Perhaps it’s because the bad guy can only be the hero for so long. Or maybe it’s just a phase. The last full song on the album is “Less Than Zero,” a nod to Bret Easton Ellis debauchery but also a slightly stripped-down song about inner sadness. It’s the only moment on this mirror ball of an album that feels truly vulnerable, and dares to peek inside: “I try to hide it, but I know you know me.”The Weeknd“Dawn FM”(XO/Republic);2022-01-10;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/arts/music/weeknd-dawn-fm-review.html;2022-01-13;9999-12-31;1;THENEWYORKTIMESTHEENDLESSPOPSHIMMERSOFTHEWEEKND
The New York Times;Record Shopping in New Jersey: A Playlist From a Fresh Haul;Thumbing through the crates at the Princeton Record Exchange, and rediscovering albums by Stevie Wonder, Linda Ronstadt, Broadcast and Merle Haggard.;"ImageImageCredit...Lindsay ZoladzImageBy Lindsay ZoladzDear listeners,I love the unpredictability of walking into a record store with a regularly replenished New Arrivals section. You never know what you’ll find: maybe that obscure rarity you’ve spent years hunting down, maybe a familiar classic discounted too low to resist, maybe a chance purchase that sends you down a rabbit hole of related artists. To honor this spirit of musical serendipity, here’s the first of a recurring Amplifier segment, My Record Haul, featuring playlists from my recent finds at brick-and-mortar record shops.I’m going to begin close to home, with a visit to one of my favorite record stores in the world (maybe one of my favorite places in the world, full stop) the Princeton Record Exchange: a vast 4,300-square-foot music lover’s paradise tucked down a side street near Princeton University’s campus. I try to swing by the PREX (as it’s known to regulars) as often as possible; inventory there turns over so quickly (by some estimates, they move 40,000 items a month), the New Arrivals shelves are always fresh.Some of my recent finds talk to each other in unexpected ways. Listen along here on Spotify as you read, and hear 12 new songs out this week in the Playlist.1. Linda Ronstadt: “You’re No Good”“Working at a store like this,” one of the managers told me at the register, “you really get a sense of who was selling massive quantities of records back in the day.” He was talking about Billy Joel (“so much Billy Joel”), but also Linda Ronstadt, whose 1976 collection “Greatest Hits” went seven-times platinum — which means there are now enough used copies floating around to make it a cheap investment. ($2.99, in this case.) I know that Ronstadt is currently enjoying an uptick in popularity with a younger generation thanks to her 1970 ballad “Long, Long Time” being featured on an episode of “The Last of Us,” but — being woefully behind on pretty much all TV shows — what inspired me to dig deeper into her catalog was the fantastic, heartbreaking 2019 documentary “Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice.” (Listen on YouTube)2. Stevie Wonder: “Superstition”My colleague Jon Pareles’s fantastic 50th-anniversary commemoration of Stevie Wonder’s 1972 album “Talking Book” made me realize it’s probably the classic Stevie release I’m least familiar with. How serendipitous, then, to find a mint-condition used copy in one of the first stacks of new releases I flipped through! I am, of course, not suggesting that you will be discovering “Superstition” through this playlist. I am merely suggesting that it has been far too long since you’ve really listened to “Superstition,” even if you listened to it five minutes ago. (Listen on YouTube)3. Broadcast: “Goodbye Girls”Last October, on a vacation in Nashville, I found myself fiddling around with a small vintage keyboard in the hands-on “novelties lounge” at the wonderfully curated Third Man Records store. Its sound was warm, staticky and viscerally reminiscent of a particular album I couldn’t place until the walk back to my hotel, when it hit me — it was the British electronic group Broadcast’s singular “Tender Buttons” from 2005, which for some reason I hadn’t listened to in ages. I’ve been correcting that error in the months since, and though I mostly buy used records, I couldn’t resist dropping $22 on a new pressing of this baby. If only that synthesizer had been priced as reasonably … (Listen on YouTube)4. Merle Haggard: “Where No One Stands Alone”I’ve been going through a Merle Haggard phase for the past few months, since reading the recently released second edition of David Cantwell’s excellent book on the Hag, “The Running Kind.” While I didn’t find the exact Haggard record on my wish list (his eclectic 1979 midlife crisis record “Serving 190 Proof”), I did find an LP that ranks high on Cantwell’s listening guide: “Songs for the Mama That Tried,” a 1981 collection of gospel standards dedicated to the long-suffering mama name-checked in one of Haggard’s most famous songs. I find his bare-bones arrangement of Mosie Lister’s gospel standard “Where No One Stands Alone” quite moving. (Listen on YouTube)5. Stevie Wonder: “Big Brother”This song has such a gorgeous lead vocal melody, the intricate layering of musical elements that makes “Talking Book” such a symphony of self, and lyrics that (“I live in the ghetto, you just come to visit me ’round election time”) are as unfortunately relevant as ever five decades later. (Listen on YouTube)6. Merle Haggard & the Strangers: “The Fightin’ Side of Me (Live at the Philadelphia Civic Center)”The Country section at PREX certainly doesn’t get pride of place — I actually had to sit on the floor to flip through it — but that also means you can find some gems for pretty cheap. In addition to “Songs for the Mama,” I picked up the rollicking 1970 live album “The Fightin’ Side of Me (Live at the Philadelphia Civic Center),” which of course has a fiery rendition of the title track, a Haggard live staple. I like how, in the sequencing of this playlist, Wonder and Haggard seem to be talking back to one another … (Listen on YouTube)7. Broadcast: “America’s Boy”… and how Trish Keenan, on this icy indictment of American military might, seems to be talking right back to Haggard. (Listen on YouTube)8. Linda Ronstadt: “When Will I Be Loved”A recent argument I had with a friend: Is Kelly Clarkson her generation’s Linda Ronstadt? (As in, “an expert interpreter of familiar material, and an effortlessly fluent liaison between the worlds of rock, pop and country,” as I put it in a piece last year about Clarkson the cover artist.) Discuss! (Listen on YouTube)9. Bonnie Owens with Merle Haggard & the Strangers: “Philadelphia Lawyer (Live at the Philadelphia Civic Center)”I’ll leave you with this charming cameo from Haggard’s wife at the time, the country singer Bonnie Owens, topically tackling Woody Guthrie’s “Philadelphia Lawyer.” I love how she admits to flubbing the lyrics — “Oh I forgot to say what the Philadelphia lawyer said to Bill’s Hollywood maid!” — and launches back into the song without missing a beat.

(Spoiler: Almost 23 years later, they’re still in business.)Also, here’s my favorite passage from David Cantwell’s aforementioned Merle Haggard biography, discussing Haggard’s 1994 induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame: “Merle’s acceptance speech was perfectly in character. Rather than thanking a Young Country music industry that applauded him tonight but wouldn’t play his records come morning, he made a point of recognizing first ‘my plumber out in Palo Cedro … for doing a wonderful job on my toilet.’” (It’s true!

Ultimate Classic Rock;The Who Found ‘Calmness’ After Return to Cincinnati;Longtime Who manager Bill Curbishley said he decided not to share his memories of the 1979 Cincinnati crowd crush when the band returned in May 2022.;"Longtime Who manager Bill Curbishley said he decided not to share his memories of the 1979 crowd surge tragedy in Cincinnati when the band returned to pay tribute last weekend.The charity concert commemorated 11 young fans who’d lost their lives when ticketholders outside the Riverfront Coliseum thought the show had already begun and tried to hurry into the venue 43 years earlier. Curbishley saw the horrifying results firsthand but decided it would be safer if the show continued. He told the Who’s Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey something was wrong when he advised them to play a short encore, but didn’t tell them what had happened until the show was over.“Firstly, the general feeling was one of emotion because of the many, many years gone by since then, so for all of us it was the closing of a circle in quite a few different ways,” he told Billboard of the recent concert at Cincinnati’s TQL Stadium. “When I think about it – which I’ve been doing constantly for the last few days – so many people played a part in what happened and it was a very, very emotional night for us.”Curbishley noted that ""afterwards there was a pervading feeling of job well done and a sense of calmness that we didn’t really talk about. Funnily enough, I was going to send Pete a note … to tell him, 'It’s the last time I’ll talk to you or Roger about Cincinnati' and tell him a couple things. As they were walking to the stage he said, ‘Bill, I know how many difficult decisions you had to make that day,’ and I thought, ‘You don’t know how many!' [Townshend] never realized the scale of it because he never saw it. So the last words on this is that we memorialized it, had a musical service as such. And now it’s done.”In a separate Rolling Stone interview, the manager recalled what he’d seen while the band remained backstage in 1979. “There were so many people there unconscious, and on the floor, and injured. I knew straight away that there’d be people dead. It was almost like a bomb had exploded. ... First thing I saw was this medic pumping this young girl, trying to get her back to consciousness, and I thought, ‘Fuck, what has happened here?' … To see these young people and the desperation that was running through the whole place, it was a bad sight. It’s a thing that will always be with me.”While Townshend and Daltrey spent time with the victim’s families during the day of the memorial show, Curbishley – who accepted a proclamation from the city’s mayor – found time to catch up with Dale Menkhaus, the cop who shared responsibility for finding the safest way of managing the incident. “I realized that talking to me was a cathartic exercise for him,” the manager told Billboard. “It was therapeutic in the sense that he was talking to someone who was there and also that he’d been struggling for years with what happened that night. He’d suffered as well.”Rock Hall's Worst Band Member SnubsWhen the group gets inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame without you.";2022-05-19;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-return-to-cincinnati/;2022-05-21;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKTHEWHOFOUND‘CALMNESS’AFTERRETURNTOCINCINNATI

Band members have discussed the concept of increasing the pace, but it hasn’t happened.""Yeah, you know, it's not getting any quicker, too,"" Hammett told Goldmine in a recent interview. He continued: ""It's just like, we have a way of working. We have a process that unfortunately takes a long time. It’s just the way we work, the way it is, the way it works as a band. And I’ve grown to accept that.""Referring to his recent solo debut, he added: ""[P]utting out Portals is great for me because it kind of frees me up from that schedule. I can come up with a few tracks, record them and put them out, and I can do it on a completely different time schedule from the band. And that's great because it doesn't seem to get in the way of the band's schedule because, like I say, we move at our own pace.""Hammett also reported that Portals had been a 27-minute EP rather than a full-length album because ""that was about the end of my free time."" He explained: ""Things started up again with the COVID situation improving. Metallica was starting to play these streaming shows and doing things here and there. And we're starting to come together again and just formulate what we're going to do for the future. Stuff started opening up and so basically all my energies went elsewhere.""But I had this music and it turned out great, and why waste it? I may as well share it with everyone. For me, I want to make great art, you know? I want to make great music. I want to make music that’s never been heard. I just want to express myself creatively.

Parker played a large role in Presley’s rise to fame. Though he was never involved in choosing the songs Presley performed, he did start handling bookings and promotion early in Presley's career before becoming his manager. Parker also secured Presley’s record deal with RCA and later helped him transition to Hollywood. Other real-life characters played by Hanks include Jim Lovell in Apollo 13, airline pilot Chesley Sullenberger in Sully, and Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.Austin Butler, who appeared in the 2019 movies The Dead Don’t Die and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is playing the role of Elvis. Luhrmann said in a statement, “We searched thoroughly for an actor with the ability to evoke the singular natural movement and vocal qualities of this peerless star, but also the inner vulnerability of the artist.” Like Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, Butler is a lesser-known actor (at least for now) portraying a legendary musician.The filming of Elvis hasn't been without challenges. Production was shut down in March 2020 after Hanks contracted COVID-19 while in Australia, where the movie was being filmed. The actor and his wife, Rita Wilson, were among the first entertainers to reveal a positive diagnosis when the pandemic first hit, and the two quarantined for two weeks in Australia before returning to the U.S. The pandemic delayed work on the movie for six months, and Hanks was able to return to Australia and resume filming in September 2020.Top 100 '60s Rock AlbumsHere's a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '60s.";2022-02-15;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tom-hanks-elvis-presley-movie-trailer/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWATCHTEASERTRAILERFORUPCOMING'ELVIS'MOVIE
Ultimate Classic Rock;Journey Ignores Drama at 2023 Tour Opener;Despite weeks of trading barbs and legal filings, Journey's Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain shared the stage in Durant, Okla. in January 2023.;"Journey played the first concert of their 50th anniversary tour on Jan. 27 in Durant, Okla. despite the ongoing litigation between principal members Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain.The discourse stems from an American Express card meant for the band’s enterprises, with Schon and Cain each claiming the other has misused the card for their own personal expenses. Since the initial lawsuit was filed this past November by Schon, many have wondered how the band would go on the road before the preliminary hearing for the guitarist's suit on March 3.The group answered those queries on Friday evening at the Choctaw Casino & Resort by playing a two hour set which largely focused on their greatest hits. In spite of the ongoing internal strife, there were no signs of any discord on stage. In fact, the group was impressively in good form after being on a touring break since early October. Singer Arnel Pineda, who has wrestled in the recent past with vocal issues, was particularly on point through the night. You can see a set list from the concert below.The Grand Theater at the casino, with a capacity of just 3,000 provided an intimate setting for the tour launch. With their mega-hit, ""Don't Stop Believin'"" making an appearance only three songs into the set, Schon paused at its conclusion to acknowledge the group's important milestone. ""Welcome to our 50th anniversary,"" he told the sold-out crowd. ""We're the fortunate ones to still be alive here.""Nearly an hour later, Cain shared his own greetings. ""We are so happy to be back,"" he said. ""It's good to be back, all together again.""But in the months leading up to the 50th anniversary run, the headlines have been far from celebratory, instead dominated by mounting developments in the ongoing schism between Schon and Cain. The pair have been at odds in the past, largely centered around political differences. In a 2022 interview, Schon admitted that he kept his discussions with Cain purely musical, in an effort to maintain their creative bond.Despite that goal, the guitarist's harmony with Cain came to an end that same year. Schon filed a November lawsuit alleging that his access to financial documents related to Journey's credit card had been ""improperly restricted."" He indicated that the issue had been building for ""over a year.""In response, Cain accused Schon of running up ""enormous personal charges"" on the group's credit card. Tension continued to build, with Schon labeling his bandmate as a ""hypocrite."" Cain separately charged that the guitarist has caused severe ""damage"" to the Journey brand.Additional drama developed as Schon unsuccessfully sought to bring former member Gregg Rolie back into the fold for the current anniversary run, later intimating that he'd encountered resistance in regards to that idea. Two weeks ago (Jan. 13), Cain filed his own lawsuit against Schon, alleging that the musician ran up more than a million dollars in personal expenses on the Journey credit card.Journey will play a second show Jan. 28 in Durant. The 50th anniversary tour will then resume at the end of next week, in Allentown, Pa. on Feb. 4. The dates, which currently run through the end of April, once again feature Toto sharing the bill. The pair previously toured together in 2022 as part of a trek that was initially also supposed to include Billy Idol.Journey, 1/27/23, Grand Theater at Choctaw Casino & Resort, Durant, Okla.1.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Steve Hackett Feared Fans Wouldn’t 'Buy Into' 'Supper's Ready';Steve Hacket said he thought Genesis would be told 'it’s all over' after delivering 23-minute epic 'Supper's Ready' in March 2022.;"Steve Hackett recalled suggesting the idea of a longform song to his Genesis bandmates, resulting in the 23-minute epic “Supper’s Ready” – but also said he’d feared that fans wouldn’t “buy into” the concept.Released as a seven-part movement on 1972 album Foxtrot, the track was a deliberate attempt to move away from the shortform single format, and went on to become a trademark of the group’s Peter Gabriel era.In a recent episode of The Mitch Lafon and Jeremy White Show (video below), Hackett said the original inspiration had come from the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper album “where you've got the link of the songs, you've got segues, you've got atmospheric links.” He added: “From an era where albums reigned supreme, no one wanted to be seen dead having a hit single at this point, because that trivialized you.”The guitarist noted that the idea later crystalized after seeing King Crimson “linking songs together” during their shows. “I told Genesis, ‘I wonder if we could do a really long piece of music. Provided we do it right with all the bells and whistles, we can make this work.’”Watch Genesis Perform ‘Supper’s Ready’ in 1972Hackett recalled it had taken time to develop the “armory” they needed to make the project possible, including “the Mellotron, the synthesizer, the light show.” Once the band had what they needed, it took around two weeks to assemble “Supper’s Ready,” which he said was boosted by Gabriel’s enthusiasm for “depicting the action” and being “prepared to act, to live the songs.”Still, Hackett had some trepidation. ""When it was all done, I wasn't sure if our record company, let alone the fans, were going to buy into this,"" he admitted. ""I thought maybe they're gonna say, 'You've gone too far this time, guys. It's all over.' I know, the Beatles felt the same with Sgt. Pepper. They were getting very nervous in interviews at that time, saying they weren't sure if the public was ready for something like this. So I think we were in a similar position.”Hackett will soon launch a North American tour which runs through the end of May. Later in the year, he'll embark on a U.K. trek to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Foxtrot.Watch Steve Hackett on 'The Mitch Lafon and Jeremy White Show'Genesis Solo Albums Ranked Projects recorded apart from one another allowed members of Genesis to explore areas of their songcraft that might have gone forever undiscovered.";2022-03-31;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/steve-hackett-genesis-suppers-ready/;2022-04-02;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKSTEVEHACKETTFEAREDFANSWOULDN’T'BUYINTO''SUPPER'SREADY'

Ultimate Classic Rock;How the Police Went ‘Around the World’: Exclusive Interview;Andy Summers discussed how 'The Police Around the World' captured their rise to fame in a May 2022 interview.;"In an alternate universe, Police guitarist Andy Summers perhaps could have been a sumo wrestler. That’s one moment that we see in the 1982 documentary and concert film The Police Around the World.Sting and Stewart Copeland flank Summers as he prepares for his bout, offering motivational coaching and encouragement. Of course, there’s an apparent air of satire to it all and things don’t play out well for Summers vs. sumo.There are plenty of similarly light-hearted moments like that which show the Police having their share of fun as they travel the globe. But it also captures the opening moments of a rock band that was on the rise, playing show after show that demonstrated how they had quickly become fierce players, intensely connected as a unit.Filming took place on their first world tour in 1979 and 1980, and there would be both milestones and challenges. The Police delivered what would come to be known as the first rock concert in India. A similarly important show in Egypt proved to be a complex situation and seemed doomed from the start because of both equipment and logistical issues. In the end, they pulled it off and the audience in attendance was none the wiser that there had been any problems threatening to scuttle the event.Mixing footage from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, India, Egypt, Greece, France, South America and the U.S., the film plays out as a visual travelogue of the period. Summers helped to oversee a five-year restoration process for The Police Around the World, which has been largely unavailable since its original 1982 release. “It’s taken [that amount of time] to put all of this together through all of the various bureaucracies,” he explains to UCR. “The process included locating “the original film itself in a basement in London.”Once the film was obtained, they painstakingly worked to bring it up to date, cleaning up the footage and remastering the sound for the new reissue, which is available on Blu-ray, DVD and a variety of audio formats. Additionally, they were able to locate several performances that hadn’t been previously released. “A lot has gone into it to get it to this point,” the guitarist adds. “But I’m pleased to see it out because obviously, we’re a couple of generations on since this was done. I think it’s nice for people to see it.”Summers discussed some of his favorite moments from the original experience during a recent phone conversation with UCR.What do you remember about hatching the idea to have you face off against the sumo wrestler?Yeah, well, it’s a funny moment. I can’t remember if it was actually my own idea to threaten myself with a sumo wrestler. [It was in] the spirit of the funny things we were doing. We had a lot of time on our hands. This idea of the sumo [wrestler] came up and we actually executed it. It was a setup because we had to get permission from the sumos. We have to drive outside of Tokyo, go to the sumo house where they all lived, meet the guy and do the performance. It was done in a room that was hovering around zero temperature-wise, and I got quite sick after the fact – because it was so cold!Miles Copeland wrote in his memoir how there had never been a rock concert in India and only one that he was aware of in Egypt. The film shows what a remarkable experience it was.It was a very vivid experience. We all wanted to go to India. I think that was actually my idea, to go to India on the way back from Australia and not straight back to Italy. Let’s go to India, Egypt, Greece and then finally, Italy. India and Egypt were pretty exhausting. Miles actually flew to Bombay and didn’t know anybody at all, and was going to search around to see if he could find somebody so we could do a gig in a little basement or something or a club. There must be something – you know, just so we could put India on the schedule – but as it turns out, he connected with these old ladies called the Time and Talent Club. They had some influence in Bombay and we ended up doing the show at the Rang Bhavan Auditorium to about 3,000 people. It was an amazing night. We played really well and I think it’s quite a standout in the film, actually. We were very excited to be in India. I went back subsequently on my own for a few days. I remember standing on stage going, “I can’t believe I’m standing here doing this,” in front of this 3,000-strong mob of Indian people, all screaming at the stage. The fact that we were in Bombay doing this, it seemed like utter madness to me, but it was kind of a great moment.Watch the Police Perform 'Message in a Bottle' in Hong KongHow much experience did you guys have at that point playing big shows like that? It's not the largest show, but it's a decent crowd.Yeah, it was decent. I mean, for us at that point, this was the very early days of the band, so that was a big one. You know, 3,000 people in India? Oh, my God, I don’t think we were pulling that kind of crowd yet in the U.K. But not long after that, we were moving really fast. We started to play arenas of 10 or 12,000. And after that, of course, it just went up and got even bigger. Ultimately, there wasn’t a stadium big enough to hold the crowds.What did watching this film bring back for you?I think we all rose to the challenge. I think we were all very excited to be traveling like that. I mean, we were a hot band and everyone’s totally into the band. I think we were in those early stages before the [wave] of incredible fame that came later. We were very into being as good as we possibly could be. You know, the performances, I think they show up on DVD: It was pretty fierce. I’m particularly pleased with the Kyoto performances. We really don’t sound like anyone else. It was a very exciting time and you know, we were three young guys [traveling] around [and having a] great time in all of these countries and playing our asses off every night. What’s not to like?The film presents the band in a light that hasn't been widely seen. You used the word ""fierce,"" and I think that's quite appropriate.You know, the band had this amazing energy. We were very intent on making every show just killer and trying to win every audience over. Like most people who start out and want to have a music career, they want to ""make it,"" as we call it. This is what we had to try and prove it with, and we were really good at it. Obviously, It’s sort of a miraculous event that the three of us met each other and it produced this thing called the Police. You know, one guy different and it would have been a very different band that probably wouldn’t have even been a band. You cannot say, “Oh, well, I could do that.” You can’t formulate that. It happened to be the unique thing that happened with the particular three of us.There's footage of you and Sting and Stewart in India. You're playing the sitar. Was that your first time playing one?No, I was good friends with a professor of Indian music in London. He taught me and I actually had a sitar and I used to play it. I listened a lot to Ravi Shankar, Allauddin Khan and other people. I was pretty into Indian music, so that was another extra thrill for me to go there. But I probably do look like the most competent of the three of us, because in fact, I had sort of dived into it a bit.What are you really glad that this film captured?Well, you know, it was a great time and a great moment, when it’s still reasonably innocent. There’s not so much [of us] vying [for] position. That came later – you know, [where] we’re all too famous to even travel together. The typical stuff that sets in at the level that we got to, which was sort of insane. I like the sort of innocent quality that we’re all having a good time. We seem to be all getting along, and we’re really trying to kill with the performances to make this band happen. We were as one, if you like, in that period.The Egypt concert seems like it was challenging to pull off.It was fraught. I can’t remember quite what was going on in Egypt at the time but you know, the Copelands – Miles in particular and their father – had worked for the CIA, or whatever it was, and there was definitely Middle East connections. Miles must have dug deep in his phonebook and had this one phone number, which was enough to get us through the bureaucracy and whoever was in charge got the gates open, so we could get our equipment out. Now, we’ve got the equipment and we’re all stuck gazing at the pyramid of Giza and various camels and stuff, waiting to [see] if we can play. We played at the University of Cairo, but nothing worked and it was like, “This gig is not going to happen.” Everything is being filmed and there we are, all ready to go. Eventually, somehow, I don’t know if they imported something from the dam of the Suez Canal, but we eventually got electricity so we could do the show. It was sort of a tense moment.It's been mentioned that there is going to be a series of Police reissues over the next 10 years. What else is in the pipeline?I mean, we didn’t make that many records. We made five records that were all No. 1 everywhere all over the world – more than most bands. So we have a vast, very popular catalog that’s never gone away. The whole thing is kind of miraculous because here we are still talking about it all of these years later. The music never seems to go away, which it makes you feel very good about it – that we didn’t just do something that appeared and was never heard again. You know, we carry on. I can only say that over the next 10 years, [there’s a lot planned]. I know we’re going to make a documentary; there’s going to be a traveling exhibition. These things will be different. Obviously, they keep repackaging things and doing stuff with the material, so I don’t really know, but Stewart and I have a very smart and energetic manager who is intent on making sure this continues on in various forms. I think the next thing will be the documentary, an amazing documentary, made by a very talented person. We’ve got to figure that out yet.There are those CBGB recordings that were recently discovered. Have you figured out what you'll do with those?Yeah, thanks for reminding me. I'm going to write that down and ask our manager. [Laughs.] I’m amazed because that was very innocent. It was the first show we ever played in the U.S. at CBGB’s. It was the mecca of punk then. Sting and I flew from England; Stewart was already in New York. We got off the plane and got in the cab at Kennedy, went straight to CBGB’s and went on stage. It was amazing and we went down a storm. I am absolutely gobsmacked to find out that somebody had filmed some of it at this point. Who knew? We’ll see what we can do with it.​​Top 100 Live AlbumsRock's Top 100 Live Albums are more than just concert souvenirs or stage documents from that awesome show you saw last summer.";2022-05-17;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/andy-summers-police-around-the-world-interview/;2022-05-18;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWTHEPOLICEWENT‘AROUNDTHEWORLD’:EXCLUSIVEINTERVIEW

Ultimate Classic Rock;Grateful Dead Announces 'Here Comes Sunshine 1973' Box Set;The Grateful Dead will release an expansive box set of live recordings called 'Here Comes Sunshine 1973' on June 30, 2023.;"Grateful Dead will release an expansive box set this summer called Here Comes Sunshine 1973.The 17-CD collection arrives on June 30 and includes five previously unreleased live performances from the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Des Moines, Iowa (May 13, 1973); Campus Stadium, UCSB, Santa Barbara, California (May 20, 1973);  Kezar Stadium, San Francisco (May 26, 1973); and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, Washington, D.C. (June 9 and 10, 1973).""Maybe what makes this year (and '74 as well) so endlessly compelling most of all is the jazzy direction the band had taken over the last year or so,"" Ray Robertson writes in the set's liner notes. ""This was a group of musicians that listened to each other's playing. The sum is greater than the already pretty great parts because the parts were paying attention to — and frequently being inspired by — the other parts. That's jazz. And 1973 is the Dead at their jazzy best.""Ahead of the release, the Dead's performance of ""Ramble on Rose"" from RFK Stadium on June 10, 1973, is available for listening below. At this show, which lasted nearly five hours, the Dead were joined by Dickey Betts and Butch Trucks of the Allman Brothers Band for an encore set that included covers like Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" and Bob Dylan's ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.""

Ultimate Classic Rock;How Steve Perry Got Involved in the New 'Stranger Things' Trailer;A reworked version of 'Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)' made for the 'Stranger Things' trailer caught the attention of former Journey singer Steve Perry.;Before the trailer for season four of Stranger Things excited fans all over the globe, it caught the attention of someone else: Steve Perry.The clip is soundtracked by a reworked version of “Separate Ways (Worlds Apart),” Journey’s hit song from 1983. Boutique music house Alloy Tracks was charged with reimagining the song for the trailer. While in the early stages of the project, the company’s founder and owner Troy MacCubbin was surprised when he received a phone call to discuss the tune.“I’m thinking I’m talking to this guy from Netflix because he caught me off guard and he wanted to talk about the song,” MacCubbin recalled to Forbes. “He kept saying to me, ‘I don’t usually allow these songs to go through’ and I’m thinking, ‘Oh, it’s the guy from Netflix.’ We probably talked for about 15 minutes, he wanted to know all about what we did with the song and how’d we do this and how’d we do that? At the end of the conversation, before he hung up, I was like, ‘Sorry, who am I talking with? What’s your role in this?’ And he's like, ‘It’s Steve Perry from Journey!’”Watch the Trailer for Season Four of 'Stranger Things'Perry had heard a demo version and was so enthusiastic about the new reinterpretation of the song that he became actively involved in the creative process.“He had some specific mixing notes,” composer Bryce Miller noted, explaining how Perry influenced the final version heard in the trailer. “He wanted the vocals to be brought out a little bit more in some places and just a refinement of some [other] details. It was really cool to work with him and he had some really nice things to say. One of his favorite things now in his career is hearing these songs that he wrote decades ago get new life and be brought to new generations and new demographics through things like Stranger Things.”According to MacCubbin, Perry was especially impressed by how they were able to isolate his vocals parts.“He was like, ‘How did you guys do this?’” the Alloy Tracks founder recalled. “He was like, ‘Man, I wish I had you guys back in the day when we released this song because this is what I wanted the song to sound like. … I mean, what a compliment coming from Steve Perry. He couldn’t have been cooler, man.”69 Times Rock Music Made 'Stranger Things' Even Stranger;2022-04-15;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/steve-perry-journey-stranger-things/;2022-04-16;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWSTEVEPERRYGOTINVOLVEDINTHENEW'STRANGERTHINGS'TRAILER
Ultimate Classic Rock;Funk Brothers Guitarist Joe Messina Dead at 93;Joe Messina, guitarist for Motown Records' in-house backing band the Funk Brothers, died on April 4, 2002, at the age of 93.;"Joe Messina, one of the original guitarists for Motown Records' in-house backing band the Funk Brothers, died on Monday at the age of 93.Born on Dec. 13, 1928, in Detroit, Messina began playing guitar as a child and dropped out of high school to pursue a career as a jazz musician. He gigged in local clubs and led a band, the Joe Messina Orchestra, before joining the house band for the daily children's television show The Soupy Sales Show, where he played alongside jazz legends such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and John Coltrane.In 1959, Motown founder Berry Gordy recruited Messina to join his stable of studio musicians to record at the label's Hitsville U.S.A. headquarters. Messina commanded a $10-per-hour rate, much higher than Gordy’s typical $5-per-song rate, and served as an official Funk Brother from 1959 through 1972.Watch Joe Messina on 'The Soupy Sales Show'During that time, Messina played on hit records by the likes of Martha & the Vandellas, Four Tops, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross and many more. Despite their anonymity, the Funk Brothers recorded more No. 1 hits than the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and Elvis Presley combined.Messina was not only an incredibly prolific session player but a groundbreaking guitarist who created The Interval Study Method, a technique that uses chromatic and diatonic scales to make music.The Funk Brothers recorded music at such a furious pace that Messina rarely even had time to digest and remember their songs. ""I never knew much about our songs anyway, because I recorded them, and when I left the studio I didn't have a chance to play them again, so I didn't know the songs,"" he told the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum in 2005.Watch Joe Messina's Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum InterviewMessina stopped working for Motown after Gordy moved the label from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972. He stopped playing guitar for the next 30 years as well, turning instead to harmonica. The Funk Brothers went on tour in 2002 after being spotlighted in the Standing in the Shadows of Motown documentary, and the surviving band members received a Grammy Legend Award in 2004.The Motown Museum paid tribute to Messina on Facebook yesterday, writing, ""Motown Museum sends our sincere condolences to the Messina family, and to Joe's friends and fans around the world.""In Memoriam: 2022 DeathsA look at those we've lost.";2022-04-05;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-messina-funk-brothers-dead/;2022-04-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKFUNKBROTHERSGUITARISTJOEMESSINADEADAT93

As part of their 50th Anniversary Tour, Tom Johnston, Michael McDonald, Pat Simmons and John McFee, will perform iconic hits starting Friday, May 13, 2022, and will close out the run on May 28, 2022.Formed in 1970, the Doobie Brothers established themselves as one of rock’s premier acts thanks to their well-crafted songs and dynamic harmonies. McDonald joined the band in 1975, coinciding with some of their biggest commercial hits, including “Taking It to the Streets,” “What a Fool Believes” and “Real Love.” The group disbanded in 1982 and McDonald forged a successful solo career. The Doobies would reunite without him, but the singer still occasionally rejoined his former bandmates over the years.In 2019, the Doobie Brothers announced McDonald would return to the group for a 50th-anniversary tour. And though the trek was initially postponed by the COVID pandemic, the band felt the same old magic when they were finally able to get back onstage.“It feels so natural; it doesn’t feel like it's much different than it ever was,” McDonald admitted to USA Today. “Our friendships have always existed, so it’s almost like we’ve always been doing it. But on the other hand, we’ve grown because of it. When you spend the better part of a month together at any given time, we’ve been able to sit around and reminisce about a lot of stuff. I was talking to John [McFee] about how at our age, playing these venues still and getting to go out and tour like this, that’s something we don’t take for granted.”For your chance to see the Doobie Brothers in Las Vegas -- including tickets to their May 20 performance, roundtrip airfare and two-night accommodation at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino -- enter your name, email and phone number into the entry form at the top of this page.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Geezer Butler Supergroup Deadland Ritual Ended When 'Reality Hit';Deadland Ritual guitarist Steve Stevens said the band ended after the members “lost interest” in being an opening act in January 2022.;"Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens said his supergroup Deadland Ritual ground to a halt after the members faced the reality of having to tour as an opening act.The band also featured Black Sabbath’s Geezer Butler, former Guns N’ Roses drummer Matt Sorum and Apocalyptica singer Franky Perez. They released their first single in 2018 and later said an album’s worth of material was written, but they haven’t been active since the pandemic began.“It was really difficult,” Stevens told Eddie Trunk on SiriusXM. “We went out and toured Europe. We're all seasoned musicians and we're used to a certain lifestyle, and here we were having to open. We did a number of festival dates and small club dates. Initially, everyone said they were willing to do that, willing to get in the trenches. ... When reality hit, and there was crappy food and crappy hotels and all that kind of stuff, I think people lost interest.”Butler said in 2021 that the band was “dead” after Sorum decided to leave just before album sessions began, and then “everything closed down” because Stevens had a lung condition that meant the coronavirus posed an extreme risk to him. “We just didn’t revive it,” the bassist noted.In the new interview, Stevens paid tribute to the other members and reported that they all remained friends. “From the first day of rehearsal, to walk in there and play against the sound of Geezer Butler, man, I would have paid just to be there,"" he added. ""Incredible … such a unique and profound influence on music, those records and that sound that I grew up with, and there I am playing against it! The hair stood up on my fucking arms.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Ozzy Osbourne's Long, Hard Road to 'Patient Number 9';A look back at Ozzy Osbourne's health issues, as the ex-Black Sabbath legend released his second solo LP in three years in September 2022.;"Ozzy Osbourne has recorded two solo albums in the past three years, including Patient Number 9, which is out now. But he’s faced a long series of health challenges every step of the way.The chronic pain got so bad earlier this year that Osbourne admitted that he hoped he wouldn't wake up as he prepared for his most recent surgery.Thankfully, the Black Sabbath legend persevered and had a much better outlook by the time he made a surprise return to the stage in early August, performing alongside longtime bandmate Tony Iommi.“You have not seen the end of Ozzy Osbourne, I promise you,” he told The Guardian. “If I have to go up there and die on the first song, I’ll still be back the next day.”Without question, it’s that steadfast positive attitude that has kept Osbourne moving forward through the dark times – including an ATV accident in 2003, which was reportedly almost fatal. Though his doctors were able to successfully address the myriad of injuries Osbourne suffered, there have been further challenges in recent years related to the mishap.Osbourne began to cancel tour dates in 2018 on his farewell tour after a hand infection caused his thumb to swell “to the size of a fuckin’ lightbulb.” Although he didn’t feel sick and was cracking jokes with the doctors, the infection was quite serious. Osbourne underwent emergency surgery for three separate staph infections in his hand to prevent permanent damage or even death.More cancellations followed in early 2019, attributed this time to a severe upper-respiratory infection. Osbourne would later develop pneumonia. “I'm completely devastated for having to postpone the European leg of my tour,"" he said in a news release at the time. ""It just seems that since October everything I touch has turned to shit.By April 2019, Osbourne had shelved all of his tour dates due to what was described as an injury “sustained while dealing with his recent bout of pneumonia.”Sharon Osbourne eventually explained the decision to postpone the shows, revealing that a fall had dislodged metal rods inserted in her husband’s body after the 2003 ATV accident. The spill, which happened in the middle of the night, had re-injured his back, neck and shoulders, she added. His recovery would be slow moving, but Osbourne worked diligently through physical and occupational therapy. His health issues continued, however, as blood clots appeared in his legs. “It’s scary stuff,” Osbourne told Rolling Stone. “From 40 [years old] to 70 was OK and suddenly you get to 70 and everything caved in on me.”Still, Osbourne continued to work on new music, recording nine song ideas in that same period. Ordinary Man took shape in a marathon four-day period with producer Andrew Watt at the helm. Guns N’ Roses bassist Duff McKagan and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith formed the core of the writing team who collaborated with Osbourne and Watt.McKagan noted that the sessions could have gone “sideways in a second,” as he told former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones. Still, he felt that the limited time they had to work on the material ultimately contributed positively to the album that emerged.Watch Ozzy Osbourne's Video for 'Under the Graveyard'Ordinary Man arrived in February 2020 featuring additional collaborations with Elton John and Slash. Unfortunately, Osbourne’s health woes continued. He confirmed a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease while speaking with Good Morning America.He tempered that revelation a month later, however, by revealing that he had first received the news in 2003. “I’m not dying from Parkinson’s. I’ve been working with it most of my life,” Osbourne told the Los Angeles Times. “I’ve cheated death so many times. If tomorrow you read ‘Ozzy Osbourne never woke up this morning,’ you wouldn’t go, ‘Oh, my God!’ You’d go, ‘Well, it finally caught up with him.’”Even with the brave outlook, Osbourne shared his frustration during an interview with SiriusXM’s Jenny McCarthy. Osbourne was “convinced” he was dying and that his family had been hiding it from him. Sharon, he added, reassured him that was not the case.He then canceled his 2020 touring schedule since there were “six [to] eight weeks” of medical treatments on the horizon. Further cancellations followed due to coronavirus concerns and Parkinson’s-related related matters. He eventually tested positive for the COVID-19 virus in early 2022.Less than a year after the release of Ordinary Man, news emerged that Osbourne was working on another solo album. Watt reported in December 2020 that they were “about halfway through” the recording process for the follow-up.Watt added that the songs had been split between Smith and Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins and that he was jazzed by what had been coming out. Hawkins’ contributions, “harken back to Ozzy's ‘80s era, in a great way,” Watt told Guitar World, adding, “I think it's so cool for a rock fan to be able to listen to half an album with Chad Smith on drums, and then you flip it over and you get to hear Taylor Hawkins.”These ongoing musical projects were important in keeping Osbourne’s spirits high, he admitted in 2021: “It’s kept me alive, you know. These past two years I’ve been in a terrible fucking state between the accident and then the pandemic. It’s kept me sane. I’ve needed the music.”Watch Ozzy Osbourne's 'Patient Number 9' VideoOsbourne revealed more collaborations in October 2021, telling SiriusXM that longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde was in the mix, along with Eric Clapton and Tony Iommi. Jeff Beck also performed on the LP that became Patient Number 9, although they were unable to get his former Yardbirds bandmate Jimmy Page to participate. Osbourne then announced the new record’s official completion in April 2022, noting in a social media post that he had delivered the finished work to his label, Epic Records.Following a bout with COVID-19, he finally underwent surgery in June to address lingering issues with his neck and spine. It was a serious operation, with Sharon saying that the outcome would really “determine the rest of his life.”Thankfully, Osbourne came through the surgery well and Sharon updated fans on his successful progress via Twitter. ""Our family would like to express so much gratitude for the overwhelming amount of love and support leading up to Ozzy’s surgery! Ozzy is doing well and on the road to recovery! Your love means the world to him.""He confirmed Patient Number 9 in late June, revealing the album’s title track (which features Beck) and a September release date. “It's no secret that the last four years have been very difficult for me,” Osbourne admitted during a Q&A with fans, “but making this album took my mind off of my problems.""Osbourne also praised the contributions of Iommi during the same discussion. “It was really great working with Tony. He's the riff master. No one can touch him in that respect. I only wish we had these songs for Black Sabbath's 13 album.""In his view, there’s one more milestone that would make the past several years of struggle worthwhile: A trip to the top of the charts for Patient Number 9. ""I still want to have a No. 1 record in England,"" Osbourne said in the summer of 2022, ""and this album is worthy of being the one.”Legends Who Never Had a No. 1 SingleIt's all the more surprising when you consider the success so many of them had by any other measure. See Ozzy Osbourne in 25 Interesting Rock Movie Facts";2022-09-09;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ozzy-osbourne-health-issues/;2022-09-11;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKOZZYOSBOURNE'SLONG,HARDROADTO'PATIENTNUMBER9'

Leon Huff and I were proud to have him as part of our Mighty Three music writing team, which helped create our signature brand of TSOP. He was a great talent and my dear friend.”Huff added, “Thom Bell was my favorite musician, arranger, songwriter and music producer of all time. It was my esteem[ed] honor and pleasure to work with him creatively and as a business partner. Rest in peace.”Born in Jamaica in 1943, Bell moved to Philadelphia as a child and studied classical piano before discovering pop music. His first production work came with Cameo Records, where he delivered two songs for the Delfonics.

When they’re paying for something, give them your best. … And from the very moment that needle goes down, you want it to be a memorable occasion.

""But I had to, from that moment on, figure out how to protect myself from being tempted and not ending up doing something that I shouldn't be doing — which I would regret doing later.""He continued: ""So I came up with this thing, like, 'Michael, why did you… leave the Scorpions? For the same reasons you should not join Ozzy Osbourne, Motorhead or Deep Purple or Ian Hunter or any of those people who asked me.' For the same reason, because I would have to copy all of the stuff for live shows they had done before. I hate copying. It would not be Michael Schenker expressing himself and it would just not make any sense to what my mission is.""Schenker said he wouldn't have been the only one disappointed in a partnership with the Prince of Darkness. ""If I would have joined Ozzy Osbourne he would have been sorry because I did so many things,"" he added. ""I did acoustic instrumentals, electric instrumentals, covers, you name it.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Pete Sears Says Rod Stewart Didn't Expect 'Maggie May' to Hit;Pete Sears discussed working with Rod Stewart, Jefferson Starship and Jerry Garcia in a March 2022 interview.;"With one of the most impressive resumes in rock, Pete Sears has a lot to look back on.Growing up in South London, he frequented popular blues clubs and eagerly absorbed the music of legends like Freddie King, Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters, while simultaneously exploring jazz albums from the likes of Oscar Peterson and Dave Brubeck, as well as folk and local Celtic music. Soon, Sears went from piano lessons and casual school gigs to performing professionally with English bands like Sons of Fred, Les Fleur de Lys and the Sam Gopal Dream.A few years later, he'd become well connected in the industry, appearing on four Rod Stewart albums between 1970-74 – a run that included the incredibly successful hit, ""Maggie May."" Sears then helped form Jefferson Starship, whom he continued to play with until 1987. He joined Hot Tuna, the more blues-based Jefferson Airplane offshoot, and recorded a handful of albums with them. Along the way, Sears rubbed shoulders with a host of legends, including Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, Ike and Tina Turner, Neal Schon, John Lee Hooker, Betty Davis and more.Sears spoke with UCR from his home in California, where he continues to play and record in rock bands like Moonalice, whose new single, ""Let's Get Funky,"" is out now, and the David Nelson Band.One of your first professional recording experiences, when you were still a teenager, was at none other than Abbey Road Studios, which was then called EMI Studios. Was that intimidating to you?I was in this sort of dreamlike state the whole time. You just sort of take it as it comes, you know? I mean, it was amazing. It's what I was doing then: I was out on the road playing. It wasn't intimidating in that sense. You're just young and arrogant, and you're out there and you're just doing it. Nerves, of course, at different times in my career have played a factor. I'm not without being nervous about things. Just at that point in my life, I was just living in this sort of dreamlike state and playing rock 'n' roll.At one point in those early days, you wound up playing with Jimi Hendrix. Do you remember your first impression of him?Yeah, that was actually the second band I played with, Fleur de Lys. We played Motown, Impressions, that sort of thing, I was playing keys for those guys. A couple of guys were staying at Eric Burdon's house from the Animals, in London. I was over there just hanging out in the kitchen and [Hendrix manager] Chas [Chandler, the Animals former bassist] walks in with this guy. Real nice guy, you know. Just wore jeans, none of the really fancy clothing that he wore later on. We had a long talk for about an hour, just sitting there talking and chatting. He played guitar with Little Richard, but I had no idea he was as good as he was. He was just real nice. Unassuming wasn't egotistical or anything, at that point. I think he was always a very cool guy. I knew Mitch Mitchell, the drummer, but at that point, I didn't know anything about the Experience down the line, he was just a guy I met. Then Chas brought him down and he overdubbed on a record we were making called ""Amen,"" an old Impressions song, but nobody knows what happened to the acetate.And you ran into Hendrix again when you were in Sam Gopal's Dream, right?We were playing the Speakeasy. And Jimi just came up. He took our guitar player's guitar, played it backwards — it still sounded great — and used the mic stand to slide against the neck, that kind of a slide guitar sort of thing. And, Mick, my guitar player, picked my bass up and I sat on the B-3 [organ]. So we just did this crazy jam.Listen to Rod Stewart's 'Maggie May'I'm curious about how you ended up in the Rod Stewart circle. Where did that connection come from?I think most people would say that there's a few people in their lives that they think were key in a way. One guy I was really close with – a good friend, he played drums with the Jeff Beck band and is on the album Truth – Micky Waller, the drummer. Micky Waller was one of Charlie Watts' favorite drummers. They were really close. [I] formed a band called Silver Metre, [with Tom Cowan and Leigh Stevens of Blue Cheer], and Micky was part of that. We recorded at Trident Studios in London, and Micky introduced me to Rod. So I played on Rod's second solo album, Gasoline Alley. I went in and played piano on ""Country Comfort"" and bass on a song called ""Cut Across Shorty"" that he did. So then, I did four albums with him. I did Every Picture Tells a Story and then, Never a Dull Moment, and then Smiler was the last one.You must have clicked with those guys in some way. It doesn't sound like you necessarily planned to stick around for four albums, yet you did.Yeah, right. We got pretty close here for a while, Rod and I. You know, I'd go off — I was with Silver Metre and then I joined Stoneground, and then after that, I was back in the states, and I flew back to play on Every Picture Tells a Story, which is probably my favorite Rod Stewart album. And everything was very spontaneous in the studio.That spontaneity seems to come through on those early albums in the song choices. You mentioned ""Country Comfort,"" which is an Elton John song. And one of my favorites on Every Picture Tells a Story is the cover of Bob Dylan's ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time."" It seems like Rod was trying out a lot of things.Yeah, he had sort of diverse influences. He liked Bob Dylan a lot, and he also liked Sam Cooke. He had this sort of interesting [mix] of the blues and folk, so it all sort of came together. Rod, he had a really interesting way of producing. He'd really be into the feel, rather than microscopically sort of going in and making sure everything's absolutely perfect.And yet that album still sounds quite cohesive.That's right. It really did come together that way. We'd go over to his house in the afternoon, and then we'd sit and I'd play his piano and the guys would play an acoustic guitar. We'd just get everything, listen to the song and then go to the studio. Almost first take, you know?Was ""Maggie May"" one of those one-take songs?Well, not quite. ""Maggie May,"" I wasn't there when they recorded that song. They did it with Ian McLagan, who'd come from the Faces. Amazing, great friend, amazing keyboard player — [he] played the B-3, and they did the whole thing. That day, I wasn't there. But I came in and played the Celeste on that, which is like a [plays riff on piano], like a toy piano. That's me near the end of the song. Yeah, that's the reason it was a big hit. [Laughs.] That was a joke.Did you have any inclination at the time that it was going to be a big hit?No, none of us did. In fact, the song that was the A-side was the one I was playing piano on, which is [plays another riff], ""Reason to Believe."" [Sings] ""If you listen long enough to"" — I played piano on that, and that was released as the A-side single. And the B side was ""Maggie May,"" but the DJs started playing ""Maggie May"" and it just took off. And so it was a surprise to Rod.Listen to Grace Slick's 'Better Lying Down'When you formed Jefferson Starship and started writing songs with Grace Slick, what was that process like?Actually, early '73, I was co-producing an album for a woman named Kathi McDonald, arranging the music, called Insane Asylum... David Freiberg, who played bass and sang with Quicksilver Messenger Service with John Cipollina, he was in the last version of the Airplane. So, they were upstairs. I bumped into David in the hallway. He said, ""Why don't you come up and say hi to Paul [Kantner] and Grace? And I went up, I was in the studio, just sitting down playing some blues piano, and then I didn't realize that they'd hit record and Grace was upstairs scribbling away. And she came up with a song called ""Better Lying Down,"" one of her more subtle lyrics. [Laughs.] Grace and I carried on writing through the '70s. Later on, I'd write music and send Grace the music and she'd write lyrics to that music. And sometimes I regret doing it that way in some ways, I think. I wish I'd kept spontaneity, you know, because I really love blues rock, and I wish I'd done more of that in our writing, but it turned out alright.I have a little list of names here of people you've worked with. Maybe you can shed some light on each of those experiences. The first one is a trio you formed with a pre-Journey Neal Schon and Greg Errico from Sly and the Family Stone. Whose idea was that?Yeah, that's a good question. God, how did that start? It might have been Neal, or actually it was Greg, I think. We got together and we started playing as a power trio. And we tried it out, but we couldn't find a singer that would resonate with us; it was all instrumental. We went to Hawaii, and we played the Diamond Head Crater Festival, like a New Year's Eve show, going into '73. You can see it on YouTube. There's a little bit of sound from that, but there's no vocalist.So you were actively looking for a singer?We were, yeah. I had my phone book. I had Steve Winwood's phone number. I was trying to call England in a call box, over here in San Francisco – trying to get through to that number to see if he wanted to do it. He wouldn't have done it anyway. [Laughs.]What about Ike and Tina Turner? I believe you did some studio work with them, including a great cover Tina did of George Harrison's ""Something.""I knew [Ike's] engineer, John Mills. He said ""You should come down to the studio, Ike's studio."" I said ""Yeah, okay, of course."" And it was Bolic Sound; it was Ike's personal studio. So I went down there and I pretty much hung out for two weeks. Ike would just record nonstop. He had tapes – you know, big 15-inch reel tapes, all around the corner of the room, and he'd just be constantly adding to that. We'd play and he would go on. I remember him literally falling asleep on the studio floor and some gigantic bodyguard fellow would cover him with a blanket right there, and he'd wake up the next day and carry on recording.Listen to Tina Turner Cover George Harrison's 'Something'How about Betty Davis? [Greg Errico] was producing Betty. She'd broken up with Miles [Davis], I think, at that point. She was doing her funk albums, so he brought me down to overdub on one of her songs called ""Anti Love Song."" I played acoustic piano on that track. But I hit it off with her; we were good friends. She had a great sense of humor.And lastly, Jerry Garcia? I just recently learned that both he and Bob Weir had terrible stage fright. The years you worked with him, in particular, were pretty rough for him. Do you think he was more comfortable in the studio at that point?I think he hid his stage fright very well. I remember [Jerry] had his dressing room; he had a ritual. He had to go in his room and just be real quiet in his room before he went on, but you know, once you hit the stage — I know what it is to be nervous about doing something. Once you hit the stage, in general, and you start playing, it just goes somewhere else.Yeah, I read that he and Weir would make eye contact after they got on stage to kind of check-in with one another and make sure they were okay.They were so close. In fact, the first time I met both those guys was together, you know. It was 1970, I was playing with Stoneground, living in Mill Valley with those guys and I met John Cipollina. But I had become friends with Richard Gossett, who was a KSAN rock-radio FM DJ, and he was broadcasting from Sutter Street in San Francisco. They had a station there, and Richard said, ""Why don't you guys get some music together? We could do some jamming in the studio."" And I said, ""Yeah, all right."" And so I went and talked to John. He got ahold of Jerry and Bobby, and his little brother, Mario Cipollina, who ended up the bass player with Huey Lewis [and the News]. But we all went down to the studio, got some mics, and Jerry set up his pedal steel./ Bobby had his acoustic guitar, John on guitar, no drums, and I just played piano and Mario on bass – and we did a live broadcast. There's a bootleg of it around.So the very first time you met them, you jammed? That's amazing.That's right. Exactly. Jerry didn't think he was a very good pedal-steel guitar player, very insecure. But other pedal steel players I talk to, they say they loved his playing. It's all about note selection, too. And he just had the real feel for it.Legends Who Never Had a No. 1 SingleIt's all the more surprising when you consider the success so many of them had by any other measure. A Grateful Dead Member Is Part of Rock's Tragic '27 Club'";2022-03-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/pete-sears-rod-stewart-maggie-may/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKPETESEARSSAYSRODSTEWARTDIDN'TEXPECT'MAGGIEMAY'TOHIT
Ultimate Classic Rock;Third Eye Blind Singer Says ‘Pam and Tommy’ Moment Didn’t Happen;Third Eye Blind singer Stephan Jenkins confirmed that a scene in 'Pam and Tommy' featuring his band did not happen in real life.;"Singer Stephan Jenkins has confirmed that a scene from the new Hulu series Pam & Tommy, in which his band, Third Eye Blind, bumps Motley Crue out of studio time, never happened in real life.“Motley Crue and I’ve never been in the same studio,” Jenkins explained to Variety. “I recorded my whole first album in Northern California. So we were across the state from each other at the very least.”Jenkins' statement matches up with that of former Third Eye Blind guitarist Kevin Cadogan, who previously told UCR that he was “not aware of any studio issues with Motley Crue.”The scene takes place in episode five of the series. When Tommy Lee (Sebastian Stan) and his bandmates show up to rehearse, they find the alt-rock group in their space. Though fictional, the moment was designed to convey the changing tastes in rock music at the time, as alternative acts had taken the mantle from their hair metal predecessors.There is, however, one tiny bit of historical accuracy to the Pam & Tommy scene. In 1996, Third Eye Blind were signed to Elektra, the same record label as Motley Crue. Still, the bands never crossed paths.“I had never, in fact, listened to Motley Crue. I never even heard them. I actually saw Tommy Lee’s penis before I ever heard their band,” Jenkins admitted. “I was like, ‘Well, good on ya, Tommy. Well done, lad.’ I literally had never heard them. But I somehow saw the sex tape. I’d also never seen Baywatch. So I had never seen Pam or Tommy. That was my first introduction to them.”Eventually, the Third Eye Blind singer was finally exposed to Motley Crue's music, and he liked what he heard.“Years later I heard this song, maybe when somebody put it on the jukebox or something,” he recalled. “But I’m like, oh my god, what is that groove? It’s so nasty like aggressive and heavy. And it was ‘Shout at the Devil.’ And so I got this blind introduction to Motley Crue and I was like, this shit is great. And so we never kicked them out of the studio, but my drummer Brad said that what inspired him to play drums when he was a little kid was Motley Crue. He loved that metal shit. So there is a part of Third Eye Blind taking some kind of inspiration from Tommy Lee’s drumming.”One person who didn't enjoy the Third Eye Blind Pam & Tommy scene was former Motley Crue singer John Corabi. The rocker took to social media to share his outrage about the series, as well as their use of ""Semi-Charmed Life,"" Third Eye Blind's hit single from 1997, at the end of the episode.""The Tommy And Pam miniseries on Hulu, is so full of bullshit, it's ridiculous!"" Corabi wrote in part. ""I shared 5 years of my life with Tommy and although it was at times INSANITY it's sooooo overblown in this SHIT they call TV entertainment! Tommy never walked around in a Speedo, didn't act at all they way they portray him, and now I see that THIRD EYE BLIND 'bumps' us from a studio, because they're more relevant????

Ultimate Classic Rock;Billy Sheehan Wasn't on DLR 'Skyscraper' Tour but His Voice Was;Billy Sheehan discussed his misgivings about David Lee Roth using pre-recorded backing vocals on the 'Skyscraper' tour in a March 2023 interview.;"Veteran bassist Billy Sheehan wasn't on the road with David Lee Roth during the singer's Skyscraper tour — but his vocals were.The four-string virtuoso, who played on Roth's 1986 full-length solo debut Eat 'Em and Smile and 1988's Skyscraper, said pre-recorded backing tracks were one of his final points of contention before exiting the band in 1988.""My last moments with David Lee Roth [were] in the studio,"" Sheehan told I'm Music Magazine. ""We sang all the background vocals for the Skyscraper tour to be on samples for them to use live, which went against my grain to start with. And later that day, I had the meeting which ended my relationship with Dave. Fortunately, I did not go out on that tour with fake vocals. I did sing on that tour, but I did it digitally. I'm very, very much against faking it.""Sheehan has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the poppier, keyboard-heavy sound of Skyscraper, which also marked Roth's last album to feature guitarist Steve Vai. ""I think if we would have kept that Eat 'Em and Smile vibe and style, the band would have really done incredibly well. Unfortunately, [Roth] made a left turn and did Skyscraper,"" the bassist told the Talk Louder podcast in 2022 (via Blabbermouth). ""I give him credit for the courage. I didn't like the results of it myself, personally.""Despite his misgivings about using backing tracks, Sheehan praised Roth's consummate showmanship. ""We had a riot on- and offstage. Dave was generous to us. We learned a lot from him,"" he said. ""It was Dave's idea for me and Steve to do that little back-and-forth bass and guitar solo. At the start of the tour, we did separate solos, and [at] one point Dave said, 'That’s not entertaining enough. We gotta do more.' So he came up with the idea and it was brilliant. Working with him was like getting a PhD in show business. He's a full-time entertainer. He's a comedian, a storyteller and a very entertaining human being.""Sheehan now plays in the Winery Dogs alongside singer/guitarist Richie Kotzen and drummer Mike Portnoy. The trio is currently touring in support of its new album III, and fans can expect them to keep things 100% live onstage.""With the Winery Dogs, we improvise a lot. We do a lot of jamming, and we don't know what’s going to happen,"" Sheehan said. ""Somebody turns left or turns right and we decide to follow him.

Ultimate Classic Rock;When Brian May First Heard Eddie Van Halen: 'Whoa, What Is This?';Queen's Brian May tells UCR about his experiences recording with Eddie Van Halen during a July 2023 interview.;"For two days in April of 1983, Brian May finally got to see for himself just how Eddie Van Halen played guitar.The Queen guitarist enlisted the six-string wunderkind to be part of an all-star collective which also featured REO Speedwagon drummer Alan Gratzer, as well as bassist Phil Chen (Rod Stewart), who May had met through Queen’s John Deacon. Keyboardist Fred Mandel, who had performed with Queen on their tours for Hot Space and The Works, rounded out the lineup.Star Fleet, the Japanese science fiction series, was the catalyst which brought the group together. The program had been a regular presence on Saturday mornings at the beginning of the ‘80s, something which May watched each week with his four-year old son, Jimmy. He had the idea to round up some of his friends to record a version of Star Fleet’s theme song.They gathered at the Record Plant for two days of casual jamming with no plan to release the recordings and everyone quickly returned to their normal daily routines. May, as Van Halen would later recollect, took a listen and contacted the guitarist, asking how he felt about putting the material out. “I said, ‘Send me a tape and let me hear it first,’ because I didn’t remember how it went,"" Van Halen is quoted in the liner notes. ""He did and I said, ‘Sure, what the hell?’ It reeks of fun. Brian is good. He gets a brown sound.”In May’s telling, every note that the musicians played has now been collected in an expansive new release, The Brian May + Friends Star Fleet Sessions Box Set, which features a wealth of material outside of the raw session takes, including vintage radio interviews, live tracks, plus freshly mixed versions of the original three-track EP.During a conversation with UCR, May shared his memories of the sessions.What was the experience for you personally, going back to these tapes?It was a big emotional thing. I was prepared, but actually, the reality was pretty life-changing, I must say. ... Just listening to it, it felt like I was back in the room with those guys. It was just an incredible moment, something which could never be repeated and never was. I got very full of joy, because that adrenaline all came back. But also, there was of course sadness, because Edward is no longer here and Phil is no longer here. Even if we wanted to, there would be no way we could get back together and experience that kind of feeling again. But the best thing [about doing this project] was that I’m here to rescue it. I’m here to pull all of this stuff out of the murky past, take the dust off of it and make it all spanking beautifully new and put it out there so it’s immortalized for all time.How did you decide to do fresh mixes for the original EP tracks?I never liked the way we mixed it in the first place. It was done in a rush. I think in a sign of the times, we over-treated some things. There was too much stuff on the snare, which has always annoyed me. It obliterates a lot of the subtleties. I wanted to strip it back down and make it sound a lot more like it was when we were sitting in the studio doing it. There’s a little bit of EQ going on to optimize the sound, there’s a little bit of effects, to give you a spatial effect. But basically, it’s much closer to the way it was in that moment in 1983. There’s nothing in the way, there’s no blurring.One can imagine that things could have gotten competitive between you and Eddie, but you don't hear that at all in these recordings.I would say there was no competitive element. There was just such joy in listening to him. He was always very complimentary to me. He’d always say, “Look, so much of what I do comes from you.” He told me that Van Halen played Queen songs when they were learning their trade. I think there’s a piece on the internet of them playing “Now I’m Here.” I was just filled with joy listening to him. Of course, I could never play like that. There’s no way on earth. If I studied guitar for a hundred years, I’d never be able to play like Edward played. So that doesn’t even come into my mind.What comes into my mind is what a joy. ... I get to be a kind of fan who actually can interact and look this guy in the eyes while he’s doing his thing. We can trade licks and we can trade ideas. What an incredible opportunity. ... It doesn’t feel competitive, it just feels great.Listen to 'Star Fleet' by Brian May + FriendsI know that Black Sabbath and Tony Iommi played a part in how you met Eddie.I met Edward at a Black Sabbath show. I think it was in Munich at the Circus Krone. Van Halen were supporting, so I got there early. I didn’t know who they were — I had no idea – but I like to see support bands, because you never know what you’re going to see. I sat there with my jaw on the ground thinking, “Whoa, what is this? Where did these guys come from?” I was already entranced with Edward. Tony introduced me to Ed backstage after and we had a couple of pictures taken, which I treasure. But both Tony and I looked at each other, as much as to say, “Where did this child come from?” [Laughs] You know, how did this happen? Again, it wasn’t a feeling of competition in any way, but just a real excitement, seeing something new and full of joy. And of course, Tony’s one of my very best friends in the business, always has been. We go way, way back and we often talk about Ed and what a beautiful guy he was.How did you bond with Tony originally?That’s difficult to say, really. I first heard about Tony from a girlfriend of mine, who used to come to our gigs. It’s very, very early days and everything I’m playing, I’m thinking I know what I’m doing. She used to come to the gigs and go, “You’re nothing compared to Black Sabbath. You’ll want to hear Tony Iommi play.” I’d go, “Oh, for God’s sake he can’t be that great!” [Laughs] But then I heard the first Black Sabbath album and thought, “Oh, actually this is great!” After that, I think I went to see a Black Sabbath show, but I can’t remember where it was. I got invited backstage and we instantly hit it off.As you mentioned earlier, you knew you couldn't play like Eddie did. But were there things he was doing that you tried to figure out?None. I don’t think I did. Because I have my own ways of doing things. We talked a little bit about what I did on “It’s Late.” Because I sort of did an embryonic bit of tapping on [that song] many, many years before. But I got that idea from some guy in Texas and I wish I knew who he was. I saw him in a bar playing and he was doing this thing, bending a string and then banging his finger, his right hand, onto it. [May imitates the sound.] It sounded like a sort of yodel. I was amazed and I thought, “I’m going to do that.”I went up to him after that, we were in the bar and I said, “I’m going to steal that, I’m telling you.” [Laughs] I never bumped into him again. I wish I knew who he was or what his band was. It’s gone. But Ed and I talked a little bit about it, because he wanted to know where that came from. He said, “I saw you do that” and everything. But of course, Ed, I’m playing around on one little thing and then I’d moved on to something else. Ed seized upon extra ways of playing the guitar like that. He played it like a keyboard and he took the guitar to a different place.He made it a different instrument. It’s a colossal thing that he did. I compare it with Jimi Hendrix, who I think made the guitar into something that it had never been before that. Even though there were great guitar players around, Jimi Hendrix came along and made a new instrument. There’s no getting away from it, and I think Ed did the same thing. Suddenly, there were new ways to play. He was extraordinary. It’s a beautiful, beautiful thing for all time.Watch Brian May Discuss 'Star Fleet'Van Halen Albums Ranked  A ranking of every Van Halen album.";2023-07-15;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-may-eddie-van-halen-star-fleet-2023/;2023-07-16;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWHENBRIANMAYFIRSTHEARDEDDIEVANHALEN:'WHOA,WHATISTHIS?'

Grohl and his bandmates play themselves and move into a Los Angeles mansion to record their 10th album, only to discover the building is haunted. Dream Widow decamped to the mansion 25 years earlier to make a record, and their singer became possessed and murdered his bandmates.""The premise of the movie is that we move into this house, I have writer's block, I'm totally uninspired, I can't come up with anything,"" Grohl explained on The Howard Stern Show. ""And I wind up finding this creepy basement. And I go into the basement, I find this tape by a band from 25 years ago that recorded there. And there's this song that, if recorded and completed, the fucking demon in the house is unleashed, and then, whatever, all hell breaks loose.""Grohl previously teased the Dream Widow EP with the blistering thrash song ""March of the Insane,"" which is featured in Studio 666. ""And we come in 25 years later to record, having no idea what happened 25 years ago, and I start becoming possessed by the spirit of the guy from 25 years ago and the spirit of the house,"" Grohl elaborated. ""But this song, 'March of the Insane,' this is their lost record. This is the record they were making before their singer murdered [them].""The rest of the eight-song Dream Widow runs the gamut from blackened thrash to sludge to mainstream stadium metal.

Ultimate Classic Rock;How Dolly Parton Got Ronnie Van Zant's Voice on 'Free Bird' Cover;Dolly Parton revealed how she got vocals from late Lynyrd Skynyrd singer Ronnie Van Zant for her cover of 'Free Bird' in June 2023.;"Dolly Parton has revealed how she was able to use the voice of late Lynyrd Skynyrd singer Ronnie Van Zant in her cover of the band's “Free Bird.” Parton’s rendition of the classic track is featured on her upcoming album Rockstar. In a conversation with Hits Daily Double, the iconic country singer explained how she was able to use Van Zant’s vocals in her cover.“That song really has a history to it. We lost a couple of the guys right after I recorded it,” Parton recalled, alluding to guitarist Gary Rossington, who died in March. “Then Ronnie Van Zant's widow allowed us to use his voice on our record.”Van Zant died in 1977, one of the victims of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s plane crash. His brother, Johnny, has been Skynyrd’s singer ever since the band regrouped in 1987. Getting to use the original “Free Bird” vocals was especially significant to Parton.“[Ronnie Van Zant's widow] allowed that, and I was so happy we got to use his real voice. They just dropped it in the way they manipulate those things now. It made it so special,"" the singer explained. ""I get chills every time I hear it. I'd already sung my version, and I didn't know his voice enough, but then our phrasing turned out to be almost just exact when we were singing on the song! That's such a classic. And it just goes on forever; lord, it's a 10-minute song! At least five or six minutes is guitar.

""After many long discussions and some good old-fashioned soul searching, we are letting you know that our brother Bill Kreutzmann will not be joining us on our final summer tour. Bill wants you to know that he is in good spirits, good health and he is not retiring.""It continued: ""This is the culmination of a shift in creative direction as we keep these songs alive and breathing in ways that we each feel is best to continue to honor the legacy of the Grateful Dead. The final tour will go on as planned with Bill's full endorsement and support.""Dead & Company, formed in 2015, announced the last-ever road trip in October 2022 after guitarist Weir had previously said: ""Well, it looks like that's it for this outfit, but don't worry, we will all be out there in one form or another until we drop."" The tour commences in Los Angeles on May 19 and concludes in San Fransisco on July 15.Kreutzmann had been forced to sit out a number of shows in recent years for health reasons. In 2022 he reported: ""After a lifetime of playing special beats, it's almost no wonder that my heart came up with its own idea of rhythm. I wish my brothers in the band the best...and I look forward to meeting back up with them — and with you — before you know it.""On those occasions he was replaced by Weir's drummer Jay Lane.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Taylor Hawkins Helped Jane's Addiction's Classic Lineup Reunite;Jane's Addiction members Eric Avery and Perry Farrell discuss how Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters helped bring them back together in 2022.;"When Jane's Addiction kicks off their tour tonight, featuring most of the band's classic lineup, there is one man fans should thank: Taylor Hawkins.This fall, Jane's Addiction is hitting the road with the Smashing Pumpkins for an extensive tour of North America that lasts until mid-November. But this trek is special: bassist Eric Avery is back in the band for the first time since 2010. The only member of the band's classic lineup who won't be performing on the tour is guitarist Dave Navarro, who never left the group but recently announced that he'd have to sit out due to complications from long COVID.But the show must go on. Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen will step in for Navarro and fans will still get a chance to see Avery back amongst his bandmates.Getting to this point hasn't always been easy. The last time Avery played with Jane's Addiction, it was for a brief period between 2008 and 2010, in which neither Avery nor the rest of the band members felt entirely comfortable with the reunion. ""It was just really frustrating from the moment I was involved,"" Avery said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. ""I felt like I was pushing a very big rock up a hill.""After he left the band again, Avery posted a 17-part video series on YouTube, detailing his dissatisfaction with how the reunion had went. Navarro retaliated. ""I don't wish him any harm,"" the guitarist said in 2013. ""I have a lot of fond memories with him. But if you're going to fuckin' open your mouth about the inner workings and dynamics of something that has been very, very good to you for a lot of years, and then not follow through on anything else, you've got it coming."" Navarro and Avery quietly made up in private, but the idea of another Jane's Addiction reunion became the furthest thing from anyone's mind.Until Hawkins called. Avery remembered receiving a phone call from him around two years ago, ""totally out of the blue."" Hawkins, a fan of the band himself, told Avery he'd been speaking with Farrell and that the singer was thinking about getting the classic lineup of the band back together to play various Lollapaloozas. Hawkins relayed the message, telling Avery that Farrell wanted him to be involved, but didn't think the bassist would do it.Avery tentatively agreed at the time, but then a second phone call from Hawkins came, in which the drummer relayed more details about Farrell's visions for the performances. It included Avery's replacement, bassist Chris Chaney, staying in the band and playing some keyboards in addition to bass, and Avery also switching between keys and bass. Uncomfortable with the idea, he explained to Hawkins that he didn't want to participate, who told him that Farrell would be calling him anyway.Avery's wife, who had overheard the phone calls, knew that Farrell and her husband had previously butted heads over Avery's last-minute decisions. She urged him to call Hawkins again and explain the situation, which he did: ""If you really want there to be any hope of us working together again, you have to put this fire out,” he told the drummer. ""You have to let him know that you told me a different thing. You have to explain that.""Hawkins obliged, and when Avery eventually spoke with Farrell, the conversation went surprisingly well. ""Perry and I then got on the phone, and I was able to say some things to him which were a lot of years in coming,"" Avery said. ""We wound up in a really, really great place at the end of a 40-minute phone call, and we sort of buried the hatchet. It was just two adult guys coming to a resolution about stuff.""After Hawkins' death in March 2022, Farrell and Avery met for lunch, which Avery assumed would involve a discussion about preparing some kind of tribute to Hawkins, but instead laid out a plan for integrating Avery back into the band, writing new music with them and playing shows. Avery cautiously agreed, and eventually found the experience of rejoining the group to be personally and creatively pleasant – nothing like the last reunion.That, of course, left Chaney in an awkward position as an extra band member of sorts. But it was a position Farrell says was somewhat inevitable. ""When Taylor died, things really changed in our relationship,"" the singer said. ""We can definitely call it 'estranged.' I do not have a good separation with Chris Chaney, that's for sure. He was very close with Taylor. He was kind of our connection. And now that Taylor is no longer there...Time is ticking. It's time to take care of fuckin' unfinished business.""For Farrell, Hawkins was a constant presence in his musical life. ""Taylor was there back in the early days when Jane's was running the streets of Los Angeles,"" he told The New York Post. Decades later, Hawkins was still there – he played drums on Farrell's 2021 solo track, ""Mend,"" a fitting title considering Hawkins' role in the reunion with Avery.Whether or not Jane's Addiction would have reunited this year without the assistance of Hawkins can never be known, but Farrell continues to feel Hawkins' presence around him. The singer said that since Hawkins' death, he's been seeing a hawk over his house. ""I don't know if he was immediately reincarnated, but I have a feeling he became a hawk,"" Farrell said. ""No matter what, I know that Taylor is somewhere watching everything go down, and I want him to see and to hear Jane's Addiction original members play together again.""Jane's Addiction Lineup Changes: A Complete GuidePerry Farrell's group has endured a steady stream of changes over the years.";2022-10-02;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/taylor-hawkins-janes-addiction-reunion/;2022-10-05;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKTAYLORHAWKINSHELPEDJANE'SADDICTION'SCLASSICLINEUPREUNITE
Ultimate Classic Rock;When One of Steven Van Zandt's Heroes Pulled a Gun on Him;Steven Van Zandt recalled asking a hero for an autograph only to have a gun pulled on him in October 2022.;"Steven Van Zandt recalled the time one of his heroes pulled a gun on him and noted that other meetings with people who’d influenced him had gone better.In a recent interview with Classic Rock, he spoke about avoiding such encounters, asking, “If your hero turns out to be an asshole, what are you gonna do? It affects you.”He went on to tell of the moment he met blues guitarist Freddie King, who died in 1976. “I went to see the Rolling Stones at Convention Hall in Asbury Park with a few friends,” Van Zandt said. “And afterwards they wanted to go to the hotel to get their autographs. I didn’t want to go to this smart Berkeley Ocean Front place, but we tripped down the hallways like a bunch of kids.“One of us noticed that Freddie King, who had opened the show, had his door ajar. So my friend pushed me inside and said, ‘Let’s go in and meet him.’ Like a fool, I asked, ‘Could we have your autograph?’ He picks up a pillow off his bed, and underneath is a big fucking .45, which he grabs and gives me a fucking dirty look and tells me where to get off.”Van Zandt added that ""to this day I don’t play any Freddie King licks. I won’t play his songs. See, it does matter – heroes can let you down.""But he spoke more warmly of many other influences, including two members of the Beatles. Recalling that his first conversation with Paul McCartney was to compare notes about running a radio show, he said, “I only knew him to say ‘hello’… we’d never talked face to face, but we spoke for an hour and he was amazing.“The thing I realized was I had to get some distance. I couldn’t come over like a starry-eyed 13-year-old kid with a bunch of Beatles records. I had to remove myself because I wouldn’t have been able to speak. Luckily he spoke enough for us both and played some of the best rock ’n’ roll music I’d heard in years.”Van Zandt admitted it had taken time to get comfortable with Ringo Starr. ""I knew him before he quit drinking and, you know, he could be a touchy guy,"" he explained. ""Mood swinger. Then he cleaned up his act one day just like that and became the nicest guy in the world.""Starr once told Van Zandt about plans to emigrate to America when his pre-Beatles band Rory Storm and the Hurricanes failed to secure a record deal. “He was desperately trying to go to the States,” Van Zandt recalled. “He wanted to live in Texas and become a cowboy. The trouble was … because he was so sick as a kid he never went to school and therefore he couldn’t fill out the official forms. That was the only reason why he didn’t emigrate, which was funny.""Talk about fucking destiny or karma,"" he added. ""I believe his next band did all right.""Top 100 '80s Rock AlbumsUCR takes a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '80s.";2022-10-06;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/steven-van-zandt-gun/;2022-10-09;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWHENONEOFSTEVENVANZANDT'SHEROESPULLEDAGUNONHIM
Ultimate Classic Rock;Mick Mars Says Motley Crue Has Tried to Replace Him Since 1987;Mick Mars said he won't back down from his looming legal battle with Motley Crue and claimed they've been trying to oust him for decades in April 2023.;"Mick Mars warned his Motley Crue bandmates that he won't back down from their looming legal battle and claimed the rockers have been trying to oust him for decades.The 71-year-old guitarist launched a lawsuit this week against Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee and Vince Neil, claiming they're ripping him off financially and trying to fully remove him from the band. Mars alleged they've denied him money to which he's entitled and offered him an insultingly low compensation package, then accused the band members of faking their performances on the 2022 Stadium Tour, his last outing before announcing his retirement from the road. Motley Crue promptly issued a rebuttal in which they called his lawsuit ""unfortunate and completely off-base.""""Those guys have been hammering on me since '87, trying to replace me,"" Mars told Variety in a new interview. ""They haven't been able to do that, because I'm the guitar player. I helped form this band."" He added: ""It just makes me really upset that they want to try and bully me more or less out of the band, so it's the last man standing that collects everything.""He also noted that he was the only band member with no criminal record. ""I'm clean as a freshly washed baby. I haven't done anything. And these guys have all gone over the top — heroin addicts, on and on and on and on,"" he said. ""What's the matter with you guys? You're the felons, not me.""Mars described his final run of Crue shows as ""the worst 36 gigs [I] ever had with the band. It was 36 [instead of the originally scheduled 12] because they knew I wanted to retire from it after that. I don't know, and I can't say I positively know, but I have a pretty good feeling that they wanted me gone anyway. Because they've been wanting that since forever. It's just frustrating for me. I'm pretty upset that they're even pulling this crap, when I carried these bastards for years.""Sixx responded separately to the lawsuit on Twitter on Thursday night, suggesting that he, Neil and Lee were the ones doing the carrying. ""Sad day for us and we don't deserve this, considering how many years we've been propping him up,"" the bassist wrote. ""We still wish him the best and hope he finds lawyers and managers who aren't damaging him. We love you, Mick.""Despite the frustration and hurt feelings, Mars insisted he won't shy away from a fight. ""I think that those guys are hoping that I'll just fold and lay down. Because I've done that many times. But this thing that I helped build for 41 years, I'm sorry, you're not gonna take that from me,"" he declared. ""I worked very hard for that. It's mine. I'm keeping it. You can't have it. Sorry.""Mars said he knows his bandmates will be ""well prepared, I can already tell you, because I've known them that long too. But I'm not backing down. I'm not gonna fold. And we'll see what happens. I'm most definitely not afraid of them, or intimidated or anything else.""Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete GuideThe complete story of Motley Crue's lineup changes.";2023-04-07;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-mars-motley-crue-legal-battle/;2023-04-09;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKMICKMARSSAYSMOTLEYCRUEHASTRIEDTOREPLACEHIMSINCE1987
Ultimate Classic Rock;Vito Bratta Was Moved to Tears by Eddie Van Halen Meeting;White Lion guitarist Vito Bratta recalled his '90s conversation with Eddie Van Halen about being called a sound-alike in May 2023.;"White Lion co-founder Vito Bratta said he was moved to tears when he met Eddie Van Halen after the pair discussed accusations of Bratta being a sound-alike.In a recent interview with Guitar World, the guitarist confirmed that he was heavily influenced by Van Halen but that he was also offended by the suggestion that he was simply copying the late legend.“This was the guy that taught all about what technique was,” Bratta said. “Like a lot of the kids around me back then, I used to sit in my room and practice for hours. I’d work on muting my strings, so I didn’t wake anybody up, and then I read that Eddie said he did the same thing, so I was like, ‘OK, that guy’s cool.’ … He forced me to say to myself, ‘How do I elevate my technique?’”Once he found success with White Lion, however, Bratta started being negatively compared to Van Halen. “I got a lot of shit from people who said I was aping his style,” he said. “That was all bullshit. It got to the point where I met Eddie once, and I asked him, ‘Does it freak you out that I play like you?’ I thought that because it had been drilled into my head by magazines and stuff.”The meeting took place during White Lion’s studio sessions for their 1991 album Mane Attraction. “Eddie complimented me and said that he didn’t agree,” Bratta noted. “Eddie said a lot of nice things to me that day, and I’ll take them to my grave. But I’ll tell you this: I was touched enough to where I had to leave the room, go to the bathroom and cry. That might make me sound like a dick, but after being told I sounded like him, that I was copying him, and all this shit, it meant a lot to hear that he liked what I did and that he respected it.”Bratta also explained that Van Halen wasn't his main influence; instead, that honor goes to Jimmy Page. “Page is what led me down new paths,” he explained. “While you probably don’t hear it in my playing on the surface, Jimmy Page is what carried me through White Lion, and even into today. … Without him, I don’t know where I’d be.”Van Halen Albums Ranked  A ranking of every Van Halen album.";2023-05-18;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vito-bratta-eddie-van-halen/;2023-05-21;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKVITOBRATTAWASMOVEDTOTEARSBYEDDIEVANHALENMEETING
Ultimate Classic Rock;Rage Against the Machine Bassist Reveals Cancer Battle;Rage Against the Machine Tim Commerford revealed his private prostate cancer battle in December 2022.;"Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford is battling prostate cancer.""I've been dealing with some pretty serious shit,"" the 54-year-old musician told Spin. ""Right before I was about to go on tour with Rage, I had my prostate removed, and I have prostate cancer.""The sculpted, high-octane Commerford said he's always been ""someone that's taken a lot of pride in being in shape and taking care of myself but it's something where ... you're either lucky or not.""Rage Against the Machine launched the previously delayed Public Service Announcement tour in July, marking their first outing in more than a decade. Commerford participated in the trek despite his doctors' predictions that he wouldn't be fit for the road. ""Two months before the tour, I had surgery and my doctors said I wasn't going to be ready,"" he reflected. ""That was brutal. I would be on stage looking at my amp in tears. Then you just kind of turn around and suck it up.""They ended up cutting the tour short after 19 shows when Zack de la Rocha struggled to overcome a torn Achilles tendon he suffered during the second show of the tour. Rage had tried adapting their stage show, which also impacted Commerford.""Because of Zack's injury, we had planned these little video interstitials that came in between blocks of songs,"" he explained. ""We were meant to go on stage, play some songs, go off stage, and on to the interstitials for a few minutes. It was seamless. Then he got hurt and we couldn't leave the stage. So during the interstitials, we're just sitting there. That was surreal. I would sometimes sit down and try to not think about certain things. It was weird. I kept it to myself throughout the touring we did and it was brutal.""Commerford said his cancer diagnosis has taken him on a ""brutal psychological journey"" that's also involved some of the worst physical pain he's ever experienced. For now, however, he's feeling healthy and optimistic. ""I just got my six-month test, and it came back at zero,"" he said. ""I was like, 'Fuck yeah!' That's the best I can feel for the rest of my life. Every day I get closer to that test is like, 'Fuck man, is this going to be the time when the number is going to go up and I'm going to the next thing – whatever that is?' I already went through some pain and shit, and I'm continuing to go through, like, some crazy shit.""He's also taken solace in music, including his new side project 7D7D. The power trio released their first single, ""Capitalism,"" last month. ""The glass is half-full. That’s the beauty of songwriting and bass playing,"" Commerford said. ""When my mom was sick, that’s when I learned how to play bass. When I was on stage with Rage, there were times that I wasn't thinking about cancer for moments. When I play in 7D7D with [drummer] Mathias [Wakrat] in the studio, I don't care what we're doing. I go into a trance, and I just completely forget about it. And it's so beautiful.""When I wake up in the morning, it's like, 'Oh, it's a new day. Dope!' Then it's like, 'Oh fuck, I have cancer' – and you can't stop it,"" Commerford continued. ""It puts a dark cloud on the day. When I go jam with Mathias, I just tune out and it feels so good.

Ultimate Classic Rock;How Taylor Hawkins’ Death Affects Potential Rush Reunion;Geddy Lee revealed what he learned from the death of Taylor Hawkins and how it affected any potential reunion with Rush colleague Alex Lifeson in April 2022.;Geddy Lee explained how the death of Taylor Hawkins affected the chance of a reunion with former Rush colleague Alex Lifeson.The Canadian band – which ended with the 2020 passing of Neil Peart – had a strong connection with the Foo Fighters drummer, who helped induct them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. In a new episode of House of Strombo (available below), bassist Lee referred to Hawkins' death when asked about working with guitarist Lifeson again.“It’s weighing time,” Lee said. “If I’ve learned anything from the terrible things that have happened in the last few years, it’s the value of time, and to make sure you’re spending your time the way you want to spend it. And that’s a bigger question than whether Al and I will make a record, or Al and I will play together, or whatever. It’s got to be about our time and our lives because it’s precious. And, man, it goes.”He continued: “Look at what just happened with Taylor. Heartbreaking, just heartbreaking. That really broke my heart, his passing… He was so full of admiration and rock ’n’ roll joy juice, and it just seems wrong that he left us. So again, time.”Neither Lee nor Lifeson have made a commitment to reuniting, although it hasn’t been ruled out. Asked in the new interview: “When you two finally play together, will you record it?” Lee replied light-heartedly: “I don’t know. We’ll see.”Rush just released a 40th anniversary edition of classic album Moving Pictures.Watch Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson on ‘House of Strombo’Rush Albums RankedWe examine Rush's 19 studio albums, from 1974's muscular self-titled release to a series of remarkable late-career triumphs.;2022-04-16;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rush-reunion-geddy-lee-alex-lifeson-taylor-hawkins/;2022-04-16;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWTAYLORHAWKINS’DEATHAFFECTSPOTENTIALRUSHREUNION

It was recorded in five separate studios.A statement explained the concept was inspired by his first piano teacher, with whom he studied from the age of five until he went to the Royal College of Music. ""She taught him that music was like painting pictures: when you play, you are painting pictures through music – a lesson that Rick never forgot,"" the statement said.

Ultimate Classic Rock;When Rob Halford Gave Glenn Tipton a Beating Onstage;Judas Priest's Rob Halford recalled the Spinal Tap moment when he beat up Glenn Tipton with a wooden beam he thought was cardboard in March 2023.;Rob Halford recalled a Spinal Tap moment in which he wound up giving guitarist Glenn Tipton a beating during a Judas Priest show.The incident took place in a U.K. club just before the band found fame and before he gave up drink and drugs. In a recent interview with Spin, Halford admitted the accidental brutality was a result of being under the influence.“I was always looking for some kind of thing to do [onstage], something a bit different,” Halford explained. When he came across what looked like scaffolding tubes but, on closer inspection, seemed to be cardboard tubes painted silver, he decided he had found his prop for the night. “I said to Glenn, ‘When you do your lead-break section in blah-blah section, I’m gonna come behind you and hit you … you can react however, but it won’t hurt because it’s cardboard.”With Tipton giving his approval to “Halford and his theatrics,” the die was cast.“As it turned out they were not all cardboard – some of them were made of like real thick pieces of round lumber sprayed silver,” the singer said. “I was always high as a kite in those days when I went onstage. I was just blasted out of my mind. This was on my way to eventually getting sobriety, but those days I was so incoherent in certain parts of the show.”That’s the reason he didn’t understand what was going on. “I’m hitting Glenn and he immediately falls to the floor, and I’m thinking, ‘Oh, he’s really getting into it!’ I’m hitting and hitting him really, really hard – then I suddenly realize this isn’t a piece of flimsy cardboard tubing.”Tipton wound up “covered in black-and-blue bruises for the rest of the week,” Halford noted. “Mixing drugs and alcohol have never really worked together with music in that respect, especially when you’re trying to raise the bar a good deal.”Judas Priest Albums RankedThey don't call 'em Metal Gods for nothing.Should Rob Halford Have Given Solo Songs to Judas Priest?;2023-03-02;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/judas-priest-rob-halford-beat-up-glenn-tipton/;2023-03-05;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWHENROBHALFORDGAVEGLENNTIPTONABEATINGONSTAGE

""I listened to music incessantly growing up,"" Gordon said in a 2010 interview. ""It opened new horizons."" Other influences included Gene Vincent, Billy Lee Riley and Eddie Cochran.Gordon made his recording debut at age 17 with a band called the Confidentials. Throughout the '60s, he became more interested in R&B acts like James Brown and Otis Redding than in the British Invasion bands.Watch Robert Gordon Perform Bruce Springsteen's 'Fire'In 1970, Gordon moved to New York City and joined the Tuff Darts, a punk band that was one of the first to establish themselves at CBGB. In 1976, the band recorded several songs — including ""All for the Love of Rock and Roll,"" ""Head Over Heels"" and ""Slash"" — for a compilation album titled Live at CBGB's that featured various local bands.It was while Gordon was still in the Tuff Darts that producer Richard Gottehrer, who also helped launch the careers of Blondie and the Ramones, suggested the singer try working on rockabilly-style music with guitarist and instrumental-rock pioneer Link Wray. Their first album together, 1977's Robert Gordon With Link Wray, was released to little fanfare but picked up more attention after Presley's death that year. Gordon and Wray then made another album, 1978's Fresh Fish Special, which included the first recorded version of Bruce Springsteen's ""Fire."" (Springsteen played piano on the track.) Gordon also signed with RCA Records, Presley's label, in 1978.Watch Robert Gordon and Link Wray Perform 'Red Hot'He hit the Hot 100 twice in his career: first with a cover of ""Red Hot"" performed with Wray (No. 83 in 1977) and his take on Marshall Crenshaw's ""Someday, Someway"" in 1981 (No. 76).Gordon went on to release three more albums for RCA: 1979's Rock Billy Boogie, 1980's Bad Boy and 1981's Are You Gonna Be the One. Between 1994 and 2020, he released six more rockabilly and blues-based records, and also toured globally, sharing bills with Sex Pistols' Glen Matlock, Kiss and Bob Dylan.

Ultimate Classic Rock;How Ronnie Spector Helped Eddie Money Score His Biggest Hit;Ronnie Spector helped turn Eddie Money's 1986 song Take Me Home Tonight into his biggest hit.;"The late Ronnie Spector was a legend but not exactly at a career high point when Eddie Money gave her a ticket back to music paradise with his 1986 hit ""Take Me Home Tonight.""It had been a good two-plus decades away from the charts for Spector, who'd last hit the Top 40 with the Ronettes' 1964 single ""Walking in the Rain."" She'd continued working, but her solo career — including a brief stint on the Beatles' Apple Records, collaborations with Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes and a cover of Billy Joel's ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" — never caught fire.Spector died Wednesday at the age of 78, following a brief battle with cancer.""When I called her up, I heard a bunch of clinkin' and clankin' in the background,"" Money, who died in 2019, previously told UCR. ""I said, 'What are you doin'?' She said, 'I'm doing the dishes.' I said, 'What?!' She said, 'I got a couple kids. I don't sing anymore.' I told her, 'Honey, it's time to sing again.'""The vehicle was ""Take Me Home Tonight,"" a song slated for Money's sixth album, Can't Hold Back. He was in a bit of career doldrums himself and was open to having potential hits pitched his way. Producer Richie Zito brought in ""Take Me Home Tonight,"" written by Mick Leeson and Peter Vale. Although Money claimed not to like the song at first, when he heard the track's refrain of ""Just like Ronnie said ... 'Be my little baby,'"" interpolating the Ronettes' 1963 hit ""Be My Baby,"" a proverbial light bulb went off.But not immediately.Watch Eddie Money's 'Take Me Home Tonight' Video With Ronnie Spector""They wanted me to use Martha Davis [of the Motels],"" Money recalled. ""And I'm going, 'I love Martha,' 'cause her boyfriend was my guitar player back in the '70s, 'but let's try to get Ronnie Spector, for Chrissakes!' Why wouldn't you, y'know? Who else is gonna sing, 'Be my little baby'?""Davis concurred and encouraged Money to use Spector. ""[Money] called me and said, 'Ronnie, I need your help with this. It needs you to be on it,'"" Spector told this writer during a separate interview. ""I said, 'Baby, I don't do that anymore,' but he was insistent.""""I knew 'Take Me Home Tonight' was gonna be huge, because it had two choruses: the 'Take me home tonight' part and then 'Be my little baby,'"" Money explained. ""Ronnie's such a sweetheart to come do that cut for me, and the video was amazing. The whole thing was a lot of fun.""It was, of course, a win all around. ""Take Me Home Tonight"" hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, giving Money his biggest hit in four years and the highest-charting single of his career. Its success pushed Can't Hold Back to No. 20 on the Billboard 200 and a platinum certification. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1987 and provided the title for the 2011 romantic comedy film that starred Topher Grace and Anna Faris.""Take Me Home Tonight"" also brought Spector back to active duty. She launched her regular Ronnie Spector's Christmas Party at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York and collaborated with Misfits and the Raveonettes. Joey Ramone produced Spector's 1999 EP She Talks to Rainbows, and she released two other EPs and three full-length solo albums in addition to publishing a memoir, Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, in 1990.""She got the bug back when she did ['Take Me Home Tonight'],"" Money said.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Stewart Copeland, 'Police Deranged for Orchestra': Album Review;A review of Stewart Copeland's 2023 album, 'Police Deranged for Orchestra.';"There was always something a little deranged about the Police. We probably didn't need drummer Stewart Copeland to tell us that. A product of the punk rock era but willing to demonstrate a broader and more accomplished musical acuity than that, a peroxide-blonde trio turning reggae-based tunes into pop hits back in 1978 seemed as unlikely as it was exceptional. There was a blend of playfulness and serious muso ambition that didn't quite track either. It was hard to get a bead on the band, in other words, and that was part of what made it a multiplatinum concern during their short, seven-year run, not counting a brief reunion during the late '00s.What the Police did most of all was create a body of work that was engrossing but not necessarily definitive. From ""Next to You"" to ""Tea in the Sahara,"" the songs stand up to interpretation, which all the band members have done both individually and collectively. Copeland's Police Deranged for Orchestra is among the more daring and exciting twists on the band's repertoire, even more than Sting's Symphonicities in 2010.The 11-track set comes from an orchestral presentation Copeland created for orchestras and premiered in August 2021 in San Diego, bringing an inventive compositional approach to the canon that seamlessly fuses rock band aesthetic - with guitarist Rusty Anderson of Paul McCartney's band and bass from Paul Simon veteran Armand Sabal-Lecco - and symphonic grandeur but without sounding overdone or gratuitous. It's an arresting take on some very familiar tunes that genuinely hold up well alongside their predecessors.The most Deranged moments happen during the album's latter half. ""Roxanne"" is treated to a high-octane, brassy opening and a group vocal treatment (by Amy Keys, Carmel Helene and Ashley Tamar) that hews from the concert arrangements employed by the Police and Sting solo. With its ascending orchestral patterns, it has a free-form quality entirely different from the tightly executed take we first heard more than four decades ago. Then there's Copeland's mash-up of ""Can't Stand Losing You"" and the instrumental ""Reggatta de Blanc,"" a cascading couplet fueled by plenty of brass and muscular ensemble propulsion, evolving into a soul rave-up before it ends.Everything else on Police Deranged for Orchestra stays melodically true to the original songs but reinvents their impact with an array of textures and touches. ""Don't Stand So Close to Me,"" ""Murder by Numbers"" and ""Tea in the Sahara"" boast urbane, saxophone-fueled jazz flavors, while other woodwinds get ""Message in a Bottle"" off to a light start that builds into rocking urgency and some screaming guitar licks by Anderson. A funky, nearly six-minute interpolation of ""Demolition Man"" has real hips amid the string swells that slide through it, and Copeland uses the orchestra to add richness to ""Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,"" ""King of Pain"" and ""Every Breath You Take,"" the latter preceded by a specially composed new introduction. As with any project of this sort, the Deranged material is unlikely to displace the original versions on anybody's playlists. But they're exciting alternatives that, if given more than a cursory listen, add depth to the Police's formidable legacy.Top 40 New Wave AlbumsFrom the B-52's to XTC, Blondie to Talking Heads, a look at the genre's best LPs.";2023-06-20;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/stewart-copeland-police-deranged-for-orchestra-album-review/;2023-06-21;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKSTEWARTCOPELAND,'POLICEDERANGEDFORORCHESTRA':ALBUMREVIEW

Ultimate Classic Rock;Paul Cook Shares His Big Sex Pistols Regret;Drummer Paul Cook discussed recording a second Sex Pistols album and the possibility of a reunion in a November 2022 interview.;Drummer Paul Cook says his biggest disappointment about the Sex Pistols’ short career is that they never recorded a follow up to the incendiary debut, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.“We could have made another great album,” Cook tells NME, “even with Glen [Matlock] gone [and] when Sid [Vicious] was in the band and all over the place.” Discussions were apparently held, much later. “When we got back together in ’96, we should have tried it then,” Cook added. “We did start coming up with some ideas, but John wasn’t enthusiastic about it and it didn’t come together. It’s a shame.”The reunion had “started off great,” Cook said. “The timing was right, and it was a great opportunity to play live and do things properly with less chaos. But then a lot of old resentments came up between band members along the way, and it deteriorated slowly over the course of a year. It wasn’t much fun towards the end. Everyone had a sense of humor bypass and it was all a bit uptight. I was glad when all that finished.”Unfortunately, a more recent legal battle over the TV miniseries Pistol – in which frontman John Lydon failed in his bid to have the project canceled – seems to have made another reunion impossible.“There’s absolutely no chance of that happening,” Cook explained. “I wouldn’t want to do it anyway, especially after the Pistol court case last year, which was a shitshow. Being in the High Court was the last place I wanted to be, with guys in wigs grilling you. It was a horrible experience. I would have preferred to have worked it out down the pub with a couple of pints.”Besides, he added with a laugh, “I think we’re too old to be singing ‘Anarchy in the U.K.’ at our age anyway.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Bruce Dickinson Recalls Playing Show to Just One Person;Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson cited the time his university band played to a single person as he argue about “being real” in performances in January 2022.;"Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson cited the example of playing a show to an audience of one person to demonstrate his attitude of “being real” about performances.The incident took place while he was fronting a band in his university years, as he explained in a recent episode of Talk Is Jericho. Asked how he deals with difficult crowds in his early days, Dickinson said, “I would insult them – either that or try and make friends with them, but in a very odd way.”He recalled: “I had one show; I was in a band at university. In the old days, it would have been called a disco. Except there was nobody there – it was like the phantom disco, and there was like mirror balls and lights. And there was also the stage, and there was nobody there. But we were getting paid like 50 bucks to go and play.” Eventually “one person walked in,” appearing “a bit shocked that there was somebody actually onstage.” The man in question found himself a chair, “put it right in the middle of the dance floor and sat down.”Dickinson said: “I thought, ‘This is great!’ So I got off the stage, and I went up to him with a microphone. I said, ‘Excuse me, sir, I’ve to know: What's your name?’ … I said, 'Can I buy you a beer? Because we're about to do this performance just for you. The least I can do is buy you a beer. You may hate it, you know what I mean?' ... We kind of relaxed and … we actually had a relationship. We had an audience of one who didn't know who we were. … Nobody cared, nobody knew. But we had a great time.”You can hear the interview below.The singer noted that ""a pet peeve of mine is when a band goes on in what’s obviously a toilet with two beer crates at one end of the stage. And they go on there, and they pretend that they're in Madison Square Garden. And it's like ‘Hello, Cleveland!’ And I’m just like, ‘No, it’s not Cleveland – you’re in a toilet with two beer crates!’ If you just said to people, ‘Hey, we’re all in the toilet with two beer crates,’ everybody would go, ‘These guys are great! I love these guys!’ But instead, they go, ’Oh yeah, just a bunch of posers.’ So you’ve got to be real with it.”Dickinson is currently touring North America with his spoken-word show.Iron Maiden Albums Ranked When ranking Iron Maiden albums, perhaps the most striking thing is that they succeeded despite changing lead singers on three separate occasions.";2022-01-27;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-dickinson-show-one-person/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKBRUCEDICKINSONRECALLSPLAYINGSHOWTOJUSTONEPERSON
Ultimate Classic Rock;Jimi Hendrix Bandmates’ Heirs Sue Over Streaming Royalties;The heirs of Jimi Hendrix's former bandmates Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell sued Sony Music in February 2022.;The heirs of Jimi Hendrix’s former Experience bandmates, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, are suing Sony Music over copyright infringement and royalties that they claim to be owed.The suit, filed in London’s High Court, alleges in part that Sony must compensate both rockers' heirs for streaming rights and digital media revenue. It is estimated that music by the Jimi Hendrix Experience has been streamed more than 3 billion times, a number which, lawyers declare, earns “millions of pounds” per year.The new lawsuit comes on the heels of a separate legal battle which began weeks ago in a New York court. At that time, the Hendrix estate sought a “declaratory judgment of ownership and noninfringement” against Redding and Mitchell’s families, a pre-emptive move designed to combat their demand for unpaid royalties before it had begun.The Jimi Hendrix Experience released three albums between 1967 and 1968 before breaking up the following year. All three LPs were successful, featuring such classic hits as “Purple Haze,” “The Wind Cries Mary,” “Foxy Lady” and “All Along the Watchtower.”Hendrix’s representatives argue that Redding and Mitchell -- who passed away in 2003 and 2008, respectively -- signed away their rights to the music in the mid-’70s, following the guitar great’s death.According to Variety, the musicians’ heirs disagree for numerous reasons. Among them, that anything Redding and Mitchell signed would have only pertained to the music formats of the time and would not apply to streaming as “none of the parties would have been able to foresee or contemplate” that source of revenue.Top 100 '60s Rock AlbumsHere's a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '60s.;2022-02-08;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jimi-hendrix-bandmates-lawsuit/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJIMIHENDRIXBANDMATES’HEIRSSUEOVERSTREAMINGROYALTIES

Ultimate Classic Rock;Journey Reunion Stirs 50 Years of Memories for Gregg Rolie;Gregg Rolie discussed Journey's early years with UCR after reuniting with the band for a 2023 encore in Austin.;"Gregg Rolie is the rare two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, an architect who built foundations for Santana and then Journey.Neal Schon was part of both construction projects, as a teen prodigy for two Santana albums in 1971 and 1972 and then as a fellow co-founder of Journey in 1973. Rolie and Schon appeared together on six Journey albums, beginning with a trio of often-overlooked more improvisational LPs that showcased their close musical relationship.""Back then, the way we were approaching it, if we had done that now, we'd be a jam band,"" Rolie tells UCR. ""We'd be playing in a different circuit, we'd be playing different music. It was based on jams, real eclectic – very different. That's still really valid today. It's almost like, 'What, are we ahead of our time'? You know, in a way – yeah. And that's kind of what was going on – it just didn't catch at that time."" Steve Perry arrived before 1978's Infinity, and Journey began its transformation into platinum-selling hitmakers. Rolie made key contributions over the next three albums, notably on the radio favorites ""Anytime"" and ""Just the Same Way,"" but then departed to focus on family. He later worked with Carlos Santana and Schon again on Santana IV and served a lengthy stint as a member of Ringo Starr's All-Star Band.Rolie relocated to Texas along the way, making a recent 50th-anniversary reunion encore with Journey in Austin into the equivalent of a hometown gig. They touched on songs from every era of his musical life, playing ""Of a Lifetime"" from 1975's Journey, ""Feeling That Way"" and ""Anytime"" from Infinity, ""Just the Same Way"" from 1979's Evolution and ""Anyway You Want It"" from 1980's Departure, as well as Santana's ""Black Magic Woman"" with help from Steve Lukather, Journey's touring partner in Toto.The set ended up bringing lots of memories rushing back, as Rolie returned to his earliest collaborations with Schon and the creation of Journey.Listen to Journey's 'Of a Lifetime'What was it like being back onstage together again in Austin?I think the main thing is it just brings the smiles out of Neal and myself. You know, if you write and record things like that, and then do them for years, it becomes inbred. You don't have to rehearse much, you just don’t. You go back and say, ‘What have I done?’ – and then change it a bit, so that it's new but not too far off from the song. That's kind of what happened. Quite frankly, the sound check was it for me, because I'm a one-take kind of guy. And then we went to play and it was stunning; the whole thing was just stunning.Surely, you didn't imagine that Journey would still be going five decades later.I said this in the short bit I did before our set: Journey has become this runaway freight train with no brakes. People come in and out, there have been all these changes, but Journey keeps going. It just keeps going and going. I'm proud to have been a part of building something like this that has reached millions of people and continues to do so. That's amazing to me. I mean, when I started playing in Santana, I knew a couple of chords and that's about it. It was a matter of the attitude behind it and just growing with it. So to have done this twice, and then play with Ringo for seven years, which is almost longer than I did with Journey? I’ve had a great time.The Austin set also touched on those often-overlooked years together in Santana.Neal and I talked about it and I said, ‘What if we could go back 50 years and do ‘Of a Lifetime’? It stunned people when we did it back then; it could do it again. And then, ‘What about ‘Black Magic Woman’? Boom. ‘Because you were in Santana with me for a couple of years, and we'll go back and do that song.’ I sang it then, which also was shocking to some Journey fans. ‘I didn't know he was in Santana.’ They didn't even know Neal was in Santana. History is a funny thing.‘Black Magic Woman’ turned into a reunion with your old All-Starr bandmate Steve Lukather, as well.Luke and I did that with with with Ringo for seven years. So it came up, and now two guitar players are getting to play off each other. It was a good evening. It was really good.Watch Santana Perform 'Black Magic Woman' With Neal SchonYour relationship with Neal Schon predates both Journey and Santana.It's an interesting story. I used to pick up Neal from high school, and we were recording Abraxas at the same time. He wasn't going to high school, he was sitting in the quad playing guitar. [Laughs.] He said he was going to do this for the rest of his life – and here he is, right? Fifty-four years without missing a gig with Santana or Journey. It's amazing. So I brought him out while we were recording Abraxas and we jammed a lot at the studio. We did a lot of that, and I loved what he did at 15, 16 years old. He had a choice of either going with Eric Clapton and Derek and the Dominos or Santana at that point – because Eric had heard about him and seen him. At the same time, I went to Carlos and asked, ‘What do you think about having a second guitarist, having Neal join us’? And I was thinking it the whole time, it's pretty hard to tell your guitar player that we need another guy. That's not going to float too good. ‘What a great idea!’ But that's exactly what happened, and those guys began learning off of each other. Neal picked up on blues with a nine in it from Carlos. They picked up on each other. Suddenly Neal was more on fire. Then they became what they became. It was great. I thought it would work like that – and it did.What convinced you that you could start another band with Neal Schon?Neal and [founding Journey manager] Herbie Herbert called me. I was in the restaurant business, and they saved my life. Don't get in the restaurant business. You need at least 1,000% of capacity to make it work. Nobody eats in the same place every night. So anyway, that was difficult, but they called me up and said, ‘We’re starting a band.’ I left Seattle and joined in on what they were doing. It was called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section, and it was supposed to be designed for singers or players that came into San Francisco. We’d have a ready-made band that could play what they wanted. But I think they lied. I think it was a band all the way. [Laughs.] And that's OK.Watch Journey's 'Just the Same Way' VideoJourney shifted to a more song-focused approach when Steve Perry arrived. How was that received?Everybody has to have this focus when they write about a band. They have to have a focal point, always a focal point – so they can make the headline. They design what the band is by their headline. And then you go, ‘Well, that's not quite true but OK, we're getting somewhere.’ It happens all the time, and that's what happened with us. We were a jam band early on, and Perry came in, and we started designing songs. I'd never really done that before, where the song came first. It was a song and then we’d elaborate. It was an eye-opener. It actually made me a better writer, because it opened my eyes to the fact that we could do this and continue that way.Has your musical relationship with Neal Schon changed over the years?It's the same. We know a little bit more – well, he knows a lot more. He can play just about anything. I know a little bit more about where I fit in and what I'm comfortable with and what I like hearing. I have been backing up guitar players all my life, where I lay a bed, as Carlos put it, while they play. That was my position, to fill up the room. So for me, it never changed. We play off each other because that's how we grew up. Same thing with Carlos: We grew up doing that. So when you start playing, you play off each other, and you're not quite sure what's gonna happen – and then it does. Getting back onstage with Neal was like riding a bicycle. ‘You're gonna do that? Oh, that's a new one. OK, well, let's do this.’The reaction in Austin was immediate. Do you think those early Journey records are due for a reevaluation?We blew up the internet afterwards. There was one person who wrote, ‘Should I know this song, ‘Of a Lifetime’? It was awesome,’ If you thought Journey started in 1977 when Steve Perry arrived? Well, no, then you wouldn't know.26 Rock Stars Inducted Into the Hall of Fame More Than OnceSome of the biggest names in music history - along with a few surprises - have repeated the feat.You Think You Know Journey?";2023-03-14;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/journey-gregg-rolie-reunion/;2023-03-17;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJOURNEYREUNIONSTIRS50YEARSOFMEMORIESFORGREGGROLIE
Ultimate Classic Rock;Queensryche Claim Scott Rockenfield Abandoned Them;Queensryche accused former drummer Scott Rockenfield of abandoning them in their response to his lawsuit in April 2022.;Queensryche cofounders Michael Wilton and Eddie Jackson revealed their counterclaims in a lawsuit filed by former drummer Scott Rockenfield.He commenced legal action in October, saying he was illegally removed from the band’s businesses in 2018 after taking leave to deal with his partner’s health issues the previous year and demanded reparation from the remaining two original members.In their filing (via Blabbermouth), Wilton and Jackson accused Rockenfield of bowing out at short notice and failing to help them find a replacement drummer for previously booked shows, failing to respond when asked to participate in the 2018 album The Verdict and not helping them repay the loan they had taken out to settle their lawsuit with former singer Geoff Tate in 2014.After Rockenfield “made no effort to assist the band in finding a substitute drummer,” the filing claimed, he “only sporadically responded to band members and band management about participating in the recording the new album. On those occasions when Rockenfield did respond … he obfuscated and refused to commit or agree to rejoin the band or to participate in the process of recording the new album.” When told the band “had to have a declaration from Rockenfield as to whether or not he intended to participate in recording on the band's album,” he “subsequently acquiesced to Queensryche hiring another drummer.”The paperwork revealed that, under legal advice, the trio had taken out a loan to pay Tate his agreed settlement fee following their split and had been required to back it with “personal property” as security, while maintaining monthly payments primarily funded from live shows.But Wilton and Jackson accused Rockenfield of having provided only low-value property and then selling it, against the terms of the deal, and that, “since Rockenfield left the band in 2017, he has not contributed any money to pay off the Tate loan.” As a result, they said, “Rockenfield’s actions put Jackson and Wilton at risk of default and loss of their own property.”In addition, they claimed the drummer had “intentionally and wrongfully” taken $10,000 from the band’s account for personal use and had continued to use the band’s credit facilities for his purposes. They claimed he’d been given ample notice of the 2018 meeting in which they were to discuss his position. He confirmed awareness of the date and asked to participate by phone but failed to call in, according to documents: “After waiting for in excess of an hour without Rockenfield either appearing in person or calling to appear telephonically, and, the remaining members constituting a quorum, Rockenfield was formally voted out of the QR companies.”The counterclaim, filed last month, asked the judge to dismiss Rockenfield’s claims, declare he abandoned his position in the band and award “general, special and statutory damages and equitable remedies” to the remaining duo.10 Ugly Band BreakupsHere's a look at 10 of the most contentious, headline-grabbing divorces in rock history.;2022-04-25;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/queensryche-scott-rockenfield-lawsuit/;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKQUEENSRYCHECLAIMSCOTTROCKENFIELDABANDONEDTHEM

""Alex Van Halen answered, and he looked at me and went, 'What's up, kid?' And I went, ‘I’m part of the cast; I’m playing Michael Anthony Jr. I just wanted to see if I could hang out with you guys.’ And he went, ‘Come on in.’ I was like, ‘Yeeeeahhhh!’”Watch Van Halen's 'Hot for Teacher' VideoAnaya recalled David Lee Roth wasn’t interested in spending time with him, Anthony was polite but “just chilled” and Eddie Van Halen was ""quiet."" But he had a great time with the drummer. “Alex was like, ‘Hey, man, why don’t you go to the back and grab us a couple of beers?’ So I walked back there, and Dave Lee Roth was there. He looked at me and went, ‘Who the fuck are you? Why is there a kid in our trailer?’ And Alex was like, ‘Don’t worry about it, man, he’s part of the cast.’ … I’m like, ‘I’m 13 years old, it’s 10.20 in the morning and I’m drinking a Schlitz beer with Alex Van Halen.’ I drank that one beer, and I was so drunk.”Later, Anaya found the confidence to approach Eddie. “I grew the balls to ask him to play the intro to ‘Running With the Devil,’ which was my favorite song,” he remembered. “He took me to the back of the trailer, pulled out a tiny little amp, pulled out his guitar and literally played the whole thing for me, in person, by myself, just for me.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Battle Over Prince’s Estate Comes to a Close;The legal battle over the distribution of Prince's estate finally came to a close in July 2022.;"More than six years after Prince’s death, the court case surrounding the distribution of his estate has finally come to a close.""There has never been a probate case in Minnesota as complicated as this one,"" noted Joe Cassioppi, an attorney representing Comerica Bank, the company which had been serving as the estate’s administrator.The late musician’s estate, valued at $156.4 million, will now be split among Prince’s three eldest siblings and Primary Wave, a New York music company which already purchased the estate stakes of three other heirs.The rock star's half sister, Sharon Nelson, said the family will prioritize returning Prince's master tapes to his longtime Minneapolis area home and recording facility, Paisley Park: ""We're going to bring his original music out.""""Our goal is to work collaboratively with them to continue to build and to grow Prince's legacy as a 50% owner,"" Primary Wave's attorney, Eric Magnuson declared (as reported by the Star Tribune). ""We have the best interests of everyone in mind as we move forward.""Moving forward has been a challenge for all involved, as the court battle over Prince’s estate has lasted years. Things became complicated early, when it was revealed that the iconic singer didn't leave a will. Many individuals came forward claiming to be Prince's heirs, before six beneficiaries were recognized by the court.Though the sides were able to agree on a dollar amount for the music icon’s physical properties, including real estate, debate raged over the value of his intangible assets, most notably the rights to Prince’s music. Comerica Bank, the estate’s administrator, placed the total value at $82.3 million, while the IRS believed it was worth $163.2 million -- and thus necessitated a much larger tax bill.The $156.4 million amount was eventually compromised in January, opening the door to the recent closing negotiation.""Prince can now rest in peace,"" Nelson said following the agreement.Prince Year by Year: 1977-2016 PhotographsThe prolific, genre-blending musician's fashion sense evolved just as often as his music during his four decades in the public eye.";2022-07-29;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/prince-estate-case-close/;2022-07-31;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKBATTLEOVERPRINCE’SESTATECOMESTOACLOSE
Ultimate Classic Rock;Judas Priest Is 'Way Less Stupid' Now, Says Ian Hill;Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill discussed the band's longevity and the success of embracing commercial music in October 2022.;"Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill discussed their longevity, crediting the band's ability to mature and embrace commercial music as reasons why the veteran group is still around.In a new interview with the Detroit Metro Times, Hill argued that some of Judas Priest's radio-friendly songs helped heavy music develop and thrive over the decades.“We’re way less stupid than we used to be,” Hill said when asked what had changed about their approach to touring. “We’re a bit milder these days. Age does that to you. You tend to mature. You do your damnedest not to, but you do all the same. We do have to look after ourselves a little bit more than we used to. It’s not, you know, partying every night after the show. … That has been known to happen, but not anymore.”Asked about Priest’s ability to write “hard-hitting” songs alongside some that were “more accessible and catchy,” Hill noted that ""the more commercial things, they played a very important role. And you can sort of blame the record companies to a certain extent because they always wanted the radio-friendly track. … It got heavy metal across to all of these people that wouldn’t necessarily have been turned on to it at all.""He cited the example of the 1982 song “You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’.” ""We were doing all right at that point,"" he explained. ""We were playing sort of 5,000-seater town halls and the Fox Theatres and things. And AM radio … picked up on that song and played the hell out of it!"" The result was “a huge boost” for “the whole heavy metal movement,” he added. “Those commercial radio-friendly tracks are not to be ridiculed at all. They’re popular for a reason.“It’s a very versatile genre because of that. If you look at what happened towards the end of the ’80s, early ’90s, you’ve got bands like ourselves, and Maiden, and Def Leppard. … All of us have played songs that will make you weep all the way to songs that’ll make you scared and everything in between. And then it got more specific, so you became a grunge band, you became a speed band, you became a goth band or a death band, and it’s all part of the same thing.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Def Leppard, 'Drastic Symphonies': Album Review;A review of Def Leppard's 2023 album, 'Drastic Symphonies.';"After last year's excitement of its first new album in seven years, Def Leppard has gone from rock brigade to rock Bach 'til you drop. Drastic Symphonies, a team-up with Britain's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the follow-up to 2022's Diamond Star Halos, is out of left field, but not out of character for the band. It's audacious and unexpected, with a big intent - recasting 16 songs, including some deep cuts, from the band's past over a CD-filling 82 minutes.The Royal Philharmonic has ""made"" albums before with the posthumous likes of Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin and Roy Orbison, but Drastic Symphonies is more of a living and breathing enterprise, with the band and its team working in tandem with arranger Eric Gorfain and producer Nick Patrick (and the group's producer, Ronan McHugh) to craft new experiences from existing recordings, occasionally with newly recorded parts from Def Leppard.The results are unquestionably intriguing and fresh - a genuinely new way of approaching these tracks, even if you'd be hard-pressed to pick any that would become the preferred version. But even the miscues demonstrate that it's something all concerned parties approached with a genuine passion for exploring where these songs could live in the orchestral realm. Chief among those misfires is ""Pour Some Sugar on Me (Stripped Version),"" presented in a quieter piano-and-strings arrangement, the former played by Emm Gryner, who also duets with Joe Elliott. It's pretty enough, but ""Sugar""'s lyrics, so fitting for a stadium-rocking anthem, just sound silly in such austere sonic trappings.That's the album's only outright dud. The rest simply brings different flavors to the tunes, often using the orchestral ambience to replace the Sturm und Drang Def Leppard usually creates with guitar tones, drones and sustains. Some - such as Slang's Middle Eastern-leaning ""Turn to Dust,"" Diamond Star Halos' already orchestrated ""Goodbye (For Good This Time)"" and ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak"" - are fairly faithful recreations, the RPO adding a cushy richness. The strings substitute for guitar solos in several songs, including ""Hysteria"" and a huge-sounding ""Paper Sun"" from Euphoria, while ""Animal"" gets a new opening with Elliott singing over string accompaniment.""Love Bites"" and the High 'n' Dry instrumental ""Switch 625"" sound like they were always made to be played by an orchestra, and ""Kings of the World"" from Mirrorball takes on a bombastic grandeur that comes off like a great lost Queen track. ""Love"" from Songs From the Sparkle Lounge enjoys a similar theatricality, while the timpani accents turn ""Too Late for Love"" into a tribal call to arms. On the other end of the spectrum, this treatment of Sparkle Lounge's ""Love"" has a rom-com end credits theme written all over it, though it retains Phil Collen's screaming solo. The idea of a favorite rock band going this orchestral route can seem, on paper, gimmicky or a stopgap filler until the next new project. Drastic Symphonies is neither. Rather, its apparent efforts and serious intent make for a worthwhile addendum to the rest of Def Leppard's canon.Def Leppard Albums Ranked  From their metal-edged debut to their pop breakthrough to the recent records, we rank every single LP.";2023-05-19;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/def-leppard-drastic-symphonies-album-review/;2023-05-21;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKDEFLEPPARD,'DRASTICSYMPHONIES':ALBUMREVIEW

It was quite the ride.”In 2019, bassist Levine told UCR that it had been worth the years of effort to make the movie to their satisfaction – including the staging of a short reunion set in front of 300 fans. “Films generally take forever to make anyway,” he said. “But as far as I'm concerned, it's been more than worth the wait because, in our opinion, Banger is the gold standard of rock docs. … Having these guys take charge of the project was more than ideal.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Judy Collins Revisits the Past on New Original LP, 'Spellbound';Judy Collins spoke exclusively with UCR to discuss her new 2022 album, 'Spellbound.';"Judy Collins, 82, has no plans to slow down anytime soon. She recently released Spellbound, her first full album of original songs in her 60 year career.Collins, one of the most effervescent voices of the '60s folk movement, earned a good deal of recognition in her earlier years for interpretations of songs by other artists. She possessed a seemingly uncanny ability to pick out a hit, even and especially when the original writers were not yet household names. She included ""Suzanne"" on her 1966 album, In My Life, a song by the then-timid poet, Leonard Cohen. In 1968, she released a single version of ""Both Sides, Now,"" by Joni Mitchell, who had written the song a few years earlier but hadn't felt it worthy for her first album — the single reached No. 8 on the charts. In 1975, Collins recorded a cover of Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"" from Broadway's 1973 production A Little Night Music. Sondheim himself had never considered the song to be of much merit. ""I thought, 'This is the kind of song that'll be played in boites — supper clubs — and that's all,'"" he said in a 2005 interview. Collins' version hit the top of the charts and stayed there for weeks.Make no mistake though, Collins, who has spent most of the last several decades touring, has always been a prolific writer. It was Cohen, sometime in the latter half of the '60s, who first asked her why she didn't write her own songs. She responded with her first composition, ""Since You've Asked,"" and has been writing ever since. Spellbound includes a number of retrospective songs that touch on her childhood, her whirlwind life in Greenwich Village and various other snapshots of her storied career, plus songs that, as Collins describes it, arrived ""mysteriously.""Collins spoke with UCR from Santa Fe, N.M. to discuss the new album, her memories of ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes"" and the rigor of working in the music industry.What has your pandemic life looked like?Well, I was thrilled to be off the road, I can't tell you. I was told for many years: ""You have to take some time off,"" and I never could. And suddenly I did. So it was an expensive rest because, of course, you know, there's no money coming in, and there's all the bills to pay. So hopefully, we're catching up. ... But it was wonderful. It was a real gift for me. And I had already started this album. I'd recorded four or five songs at the end of 2019, so I knew I was in the groove. And I had done a lot of writing, a lot of trying to get a lyric crafted out of attempted poems for three or four years. So I had a lot of material to go through, and I do still think that the writing of poetry, quote unquote, which really you can turn into a lyric when you sit down with it at the piano — it's a very good access point to getting out songs that you couldn't get out otherwise. ... I've always written poems and I've always written songs right along the way, but this time I was going to concentrate only on my own songs. And so the pandemic was spent ordering food out, taking walks around the park and down the river, down the Hudson, having Zooms with friends. ... and practicing the piano, singing and writing.Do you find that it's easier to write songs now than it was when you were younger?No, no. I think that the combination was set very, very early. When Leonard Cohen asked me why I was not writing my own songs, and it was 1966, so I was 27 and had already made half a dozen albums. ... I went home and wrote ""Since You've Asked,"" which was my first song, which I sat down at the piano and noodled away until I found it. It took me about 40 minutes to write that song. And the next song – well, I wrote a lot. I wrote ""Albatross,"" and then I wrote ""My Father,"" and then I wrote ""Che,"" which took me about five years to write. You know, sometimes it's short. I think [""When I Was a Girl in Colorado""] took me a few minutes to write, and I think that ""Arizona,"" it took me – at least a couple years to really finish. [In the early '60s, Collins was in Arizona playing a local concert when she fell ill and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. She spent a month in Tucson Medical Center.] So it's either one. It's always something. It either takes a long time or a little time. But it takes tension. It takes what it takes. ... Sitting down, letting the thing happen, praying that the muse will show up, and the muse, whoever the muse is — and I don't know who my muse is, maybe it's Leonard, probably in some form or other — but it's always a mystery, and it will remain a mystery. I don't care how people analyze their writing or their work or what they think. My byword is utilize, don't analyze. Because you can think your way out of a paper box, but it's not going to be the same as trusting your instincts and acknowledging that you don't know where it comes from. Nobody does. Any artist worth their salt will tell you that they don't know where it came from.Listen to Judy Collins' 'When I Was a Girl in Colorado'This particular collection of songs touches on a number of specific life experiences and where you were living at different points. But you're saying that wasn't purposeful, you didn't set out to write certain songs about certain places.No, not at all. ... When the songs that I'm supposed to record arrive, they arrive mysteriously. They usually don't have anything to do with my wishes or intentions. They just arrive.One of my favorites on the album, as a fellow New Yorker, is ""So Alive,"" which is about your time in Greenwich Village's folk scene in the '60s. When you were coming up at that time, there were a lot of folk singers — did you feel a sense of competition or camaraderie? Well, it was definitely camaraderie because we were hanging out together. ... There was a lot of going down to the park there and playing on a Sunday. And drinking a lot in the clubs and going to hear all your favorite singers. I wasn't home all the time, but I was home enough to get — I did have an apartment in the Village for a couple of years from '63 to '65 on 135 West 10th. ... So I was sort of in the thick of it, and I'd wake up and go to breakfast at one of the funky joints, I can't remember the name of it now, but it was very social and very interactive. And of course, I heard a lot of songs that I recorded. But I was sort of in the midst of it anyway, because my manager was Harold Leventhal. ... The village is where all of the artists that he represented were either singing or performing or living or in the case of [Bob] Dylan — Dylan always has a question in his little book about his songwriting, I think he calls it Chronicles One — and he says he started out as somebody who was homeless and singing old Woody Guthrie. That's when I met him, when he was Robert Zimmerman. I met him in Colorado a couple of times and then when I got to New York in '61, and was singing at Gerde's Folk City, he was still there, still homeless and still singing these old Woody Guthrie [songs].Listen to Judy Collins' 'So Alive'Do you remember your first impression when Stephen Stills initially played ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" for you?Well, it was May of 1969 and Stephen and I had really parted, although he showed up at my apartment in New York often in those months after our breakup, but before our final separation, really. [He] started living with Stacy Keach and he was at the door and on my street when I took off to go to New England,. ... But I went to California in May to do a concert at Santa Monica Civic. And it was my birthday. And there he came to celebrate my birthday. He brought me a beautiful old Martin [guitar] for a present, and a bunch of flowers. And then he pulled out this Martin and sang me ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes."" I had no idea about it. He had written it at the end of '68 with the guys when he started to put CSN together. And he was already in the studio, but he was singing me this song and it just blew my mind, you know, and I said — we were both weeping at the end of it — and I said ""You know, it's beautiful, but it's not going to get me back."" [laughs]I mean, I was wrong about that, because, in fact, we remained friends for 50 years, and then in 2017, after much deliberation, and many talks and many, many shared midnight rounds of emails with 25 songs on them written from a ship in the Mediterranean to New York where I was, we finally said, ""Let's do it, let's do the concert tour."" So we were out together for a year and a half, and we did 115 shows together. And we were on the stage for two hours together. We each had one solo show, but usually, when a duo happens one person does the first half and the other person does the second half. ... But we were on stage for two hours and we had the best time in the world. One of the best things that ever happened to us. And I could say that maybe it's because none of us — neither one of us ever said anything unforgivable to one another. You know, we were friends. We talked often and we often met together over the years. But we continued to be interested in one another's lives.Listen to Crosby, Stills and Nash's 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes'When you look back on your career, what are you most proud of?Getting sober.That's a good answer. What else would you like to do with your career?I think I'd like to try turning this album into a Broadway play. I have some highfalutin help in the wings. [laughs]What advice would you give young singer-songwriters who are starting out, particularly female ones?Get a job. [laughs] It's what David Crosby advised everybody else. If you wanna go and do it, don't. You have no clue as to how hard it is. I tell you, I was asked to do some talk with a writer from The New York Times, whom I like a lot. She was doing a piece about Brandi Carlile. I said, ""Give me a couple hours, let me think about [it]."" I know Brandi, I know her work and so on, and I said, ""Let me just take a few minutes to think about Brandi and her career."" So I did. I went back, I looked at all the history and all of that. And I wound up saying, ""God Almighty, this is the hardest thing."" I mean, I have no idea how hard that I've had to work. But I looked at Brandi's career and I said, ""How did I do it?"" I have no idea how I did it. It was enormously hard. It was the hardest. It was unthinkable to do what I did, and it was unthinkable to do what Brandi had to do to get where she goes. I don't know how people do it. The only thing I would say is if you have a death wish, fine. [laughs]Listen to Judy Collins' 'Hell on Wheels'People would rather hear the honest answer! Turn back now, so to speak.Turn back now, that's it. And it doesn't matter whether you're a girl or boy, it doesn't matter. You know, there's all this talk about sexism and who has the better chance — it's impossible for all of us. Any one of us is considered a child, first of all, by the music industry — there are so many crooks out there stealing your money, stealing your royalties. You don't have royalties! If you're a singer-songwriter and you were trying to make a living singing songs and recording them and having them get played all over the world, and you got no performance royalty for 60 years from ABC, CBS, NBC, because there is no performance royalty. ... That's why all of us have to be on the road for the rest of our lives. So yeah, give it a little look. ...  There's a bill [Fair Play, Fair Pay Act of 2017] now to change the lack of performance royalties in this country. [The U.S. is one of only four developed countries that does not have traditional performance royalties for sound recordings and does not require compensation for recordings when they are broadcast publicly— the other three countries are North Korea, Iran, and China.]Yeah, and that struggle seems to have been exacerbated by the pandemic. A lot of full-time musicians have found that it's hard to be sustainable.It's not sustainable. I mean, not unless you're crazy, like I am.I hear a lot of artists talk about how they can't imagine the idea of retiring, mainly because they feel like there are still so many doors of opportunities to open. Is that how you feel?I was raised in an environment in which I knew that I was going to be doing this for the rest of my life. Let me put the addendum to the comments about whether or not you should become an artist: If you do, then you'll save your own life and your own soul. Because this is the work that you were meant to do. If you don't have that knowledge, then there would be no point in your doing this. Because this is the only way that I stay on the planet.Top 40 Singer-songwriter AlbumsFrom Bob Dylan and John Lennon to Joni Mitchell and Billy Joel.";2022-03-11;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/judy-collins-spellbound-interview-2022/;2022-03-12;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJUDYCOLLINSREVISITSTHEPASTONNEWORIGINALLP,'SPELLBOUND'

Ultimate Classic Rock;Keith Richards Says Selling Rights Is 'Sign of Getting Old';Keith Richards said artists selling their catalogs was a 'sign of getting old' and that he avoided thinking about the end of his career in March 2022.;"Keith Richards said artists selling their catalogs was a “sign of getting old” and explained that the idea of his career ending was something he avoided thinking about.In recent years several older musicians have cut deals with rights-management companies. But in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the Rolling Stones guitarist said he and co-writer Mick Jagger were unlikely to follow suit soon.“Mick and I have not spoken about it on a serious level,” he noted. “I don’t know if we’re ready to sell our catalog. We might drag it out a bit – put some more stuff in it!” He added that ""you only think about selling your catalog when … it’s a sign of getting old!""You can watch the interview below.Richards’ songwriting credits include material with his side project the X-pensive Winos, who recently reunited for a charity concert 30 years since their previous outing. The guitarist reflected that the project had come about after Jagger wanted to explore a solo career outside the Stones.“Mick wanted to do separate things, and I didn’t,” he admitted, adding that he originally stepped out of the band reluctantly “to start with.” “That was one of the attractions of doing the Winos: just to find out if there was anything else … just to look over the fence. Playing with the Winos is always sheer joy because it didn’t matter. We were on the lam, kinda. … Let’s see how long we can get away with it!”Perhaps predictably, the 78-year-old was asked if he's thought about how long he could keep his career going. “If I did that, I wouldn’t come up with an answer and I’d always be thinking about it,” he responded. “Tomorrow?

Ultimate Classic Rock;James Young Looks Back on 50 Years of Styx: Exclusive Interview;James 'J.Y.' Young discussed Styx's earliest days in an exclusive June 2022 interview.;"The roots of Styx began with two fraternal brothers who ""fought like hell"" but ""loved music,"" as Tommy Shaw recently told fans.The Panozzo siblings had already been playing music with Dennis DeYoung for close to a decade by the time they solidified the band's lineup with the arrival of guitarists John Curulewski and James ""J.Y."" Young, who joined in 1969 and 1970 respectively.Inking their first record contract with Wooden Nickel Records in February 1972 officially started the clock on Styx as a band with a national presence, although it would take them several years to find their footing with radio airplay and record sales. Shaw joined in 1975.Decades later, the members of Styx are back on the road for the latest run around the country with their former rivals in REO Speedwagon. The current lineup features Young, Shaw, bassist/vocalist Ricky Phillips, keyboardist/vocalist Lawrence Gowan, drummer Todd Sucherman, guitarist/vocalist Will Evankovich and bassist/vocalist Chuck Panozzo, who still makes periodic guest appearances with the group.We caught up with Young at the start of their Live and UnZoomed tour, which also features Loverboy, to discuss Styx's storied history.What are some of your first memories of coming across the REO guys?REO Speedwagon was a band that has had many permutations, even before Styx. I think they formed in Champaign, Ill., at the University of Illinois. I don’t know if everyone was a student there to start. Some of them were, probably. But REO Speedwagon was a factor before Styx signed their first recording contract in 1972. Kevin Cronin grew up not far from where I did, although I never really met the man. He talks about how there was a battle of the bands going back to before any of us had a recording contract. There were high school bands competing in a high school battle of the bands at Brother Rice High School on the south side. I had this lovely blonde female girlfriend who went around and somehow charmed many people to give them their voting tickets. Kevin says, “And that’s why you guys won! Because we should have won that one!” But if it takes a blonde, I’ll find a blonde! [Laughs.]What did being from Chicago contribute to the spirit of Styx?Styx were all from the south side of the city, considered the working class side of town. The Panozzo brothers’ dad, he was an employee. Dennis’ dad was an employee of some situation. John Curulewski’s dad was an employee. My grandfather came from Europe and started a business and then my dad took over that business. So I came from business owners. The rest of the guys, their dad had been employees. But when we finally got that thing together, there was a great balance. All of the pieces were in place even though I didn’t necessarily see it at that point in time. Their tastes were so different than mine and I had to learn to compromise, which I was known not to be very compromising. [Laughs.] Dennis and the Panozzos, they were more of a pop cover band, but Dennis and I started writing and then John Curulewski started writing. Ultimately, we got a recording contract in 1972. We signed it on 2/22/72 and just passed the 50th anniversary. So, five decades of Styx and the world still exists. We didn’t kill it.Watch the Video for 'Mr. Roboto' by StyxNot even with ""Mr. Roboto.""[Laughs] Well, “Mr. Roboto,” I was so against that song – because this thing is targeted at seven year olds. But the craziest thing is, it’s the only 45 RPM single that Styx put out that has sold a million records. I refused to play it, particularly after Dennis was not involved in the band anymore. He didn’t want to go on the road and then sued us over the use of the name and what have you. We went out without him. But maybe two or three years ago, we all sat down. “Okay, we’ve been playing the same songs for a long time. Is there any song that maybe we’re overlooking that the fans really want to hear?” We sat down our merch guy. He gets all of the complaints from people. “How come they didn’t play this? How come they didn’t play that,” as they’re leaving the venue and he’s trying to sell them a shirt. He’ll hear all of the complaints. Plus, our lighting director who has to stand far back in the hall so she can see the full perspective and how to flash this light on that, etc. The two of them said, “The most requested song by people leaving that [you] don’t play is ‘Mr. Roboto.’” So we started playing it again.Dennis is a very energetic guy. Was he always that way, even in the early days of the band?Oh yeah, Dennis was the oldest guy in the band and he’s obviously a very talented guy. The Panozzo brothers live down the street from him, so it was kind of natural for them to at least try and work together, which they did. My trademark was “Foxy Lady,” because going to engineering school, I had a guy with electronics who could get the feedback that [Jimi] Hendrix gets at the start of [the song]. I said, “I’ll play whatever you guys want. I just want to be able to do ‘Foxy Lady,’ and I’ll just go along with everything else.” So we did that and then just co-existed. They were a working band, so we were able to make money. I drove a cab part-time in Chicago to make ends meet. It took about a year to get that recording contract and then we devoted the whole thing there. Ultimately, Dennis wrote “Lady,” which was a chart single when it first came out. It got re-released a couple of years later after the third or fourth album came out. That actually charted nationally and got to No. 1 in every market, because the record company finally worked it. We just hadn’t had the juice and our manager was a nobody that was trying to make a name for himself as well, but I don’t think he knew how the game was played. Ultimately, you have to drive down a lot of blind alleys sometimes to really find the open road.How did ""Crystal Ball"" evolve from the moment you first heard it?It was an acoustic thing that Tommy had already written when he came to audition for the band. We had already heard he was great and could play and sing. He was able to replace John Curulewski in that regard, no sweat. Really, that song, we kind of collaborated ultimately on the arrangement, but if you’re going with lyrics and melody, Tommy wrote that. It was easy. [Laughs,] Tommy could play that acoustic and I could play the electric. From there on, we really got to know each other. We had already had success. When “Lady” became a hit, that kind of opened the door for us to get better concert billings. Tommy added [a lot] to the band, because he’s a great showman in his own right and a great singer. The three part harmonies, which were our trademark, taking a Three Dog Night [approach], it kind of went on from there. I moved in with my better half once we got the recording contract. We weren’t married, [and] that was very much to my parents’ chagrin. Ultimately, I decided, “Well, let’s go to city hall and get married. We don’t have to have a big setting.” So we signed a recording contract in February, released our first record a little bit later on, my better half and I moved in together and then we ultimately got married – all in 1972. So that was kind of the foundation of the whole Styx thing, from my standpoint. Then, Tommy came along in late ‘75 when John decided he was fed up with Dennis. Tommy fit right in and “Crystal Ball,” the song he brought in, became the title of his first album with us.1972's Best Rock AlbumsOver the course of a strikingly diverse 12-month period, these bands hit upon just the right mixture of creativity, gumption and timing.Real-Life ‘Spinal Tap’ Stories: Styx";2022-06-17;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/james-young-styx-50-years/;2022-06-19;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJAMESYOUNGLOOKSBACKON50YEARSOFSTYX:EXCLUSIVEINTERVIEW
Ultimate Classic Rock;Skid Row Began Thinking About Singer Erik Gronwall Four Years Ago;Skid Row's Snake Sabo and Rachel Bolan discussed replacing singer ZP Theart with new member Erik Gronwall in April 2022.;"Skid Row guitarist Snake Sabo and bassist Rachel Bolan discussed the process that led to Swedish singer Erik Gronwall replacing ZP Theart.The lineup change was revealed last month, hours before their first performance together in Las Vegas. The band also released “The Gang’s All Here,” the first single featuring Gronwall, and the title track from their upcoming album.“It got to a point where the situation with Zee kind of put itself forth where we had to make a decision, because something still wasn’t working correctly,” Sabo told Eddie Trunk on SiriusXM in a new interview. “And that's when the idea with Erik came up. And ironically enough, years ago, a good friend of mine, Rob Hoffman, had said, ‘If something ever happens, there’s this guy in Sweden.’ And he said the same thing to our manager as well, years ago. And all of a sudden, as life happens, it kind of came full circle and it became a reality.”Bolan said his thoughts about Gronwall had begun to crystalize in 2018 when Skid Row were touring Europe with the singer’s former band, H.E.A.T. “We’d hear him every night from the dressing room, and a couple of times, I was, like, ‘Man, listen to this guy sing. He’s phenomenal,’” the bassist recalled. “Then I went behind the monitor board a couple of times… I’m like, ‘Wow, when Skid Row has some downtime, I’m gonna get in touch with this dude and start a side project with him.’ … As time went on and we got to the point to where we were with ZP and stuff … I told Snake, ‘We’ve got to check this guy out.’”The band, along with producer Nick Raskulinecz, sent Gronwall some songs “just with a guide vocal on it, and it came back about 24 hours later, and we were like, ‘All right, he’s the guy. Get him on a plane. Let’s do this.’”The album was completed by file exchange with Gronwall working in Sweden. When he arrived in Las Vegas on Mar. 22, four days before their first show together, it was the first time he’d met Skid Row as his bandmates. Bolan revealed: “I just found out last night at dinner, he’s, like, 'I’ve never recorded myself like this before!’ And I was like, ‘I’m so glad I didn't know that.’ As if my stress level isn't high enough – I would have just completely combusted right there!”Sabo noted that he and the rest of the band couldn't be happier with their new frontman. “I’ve been on a high for probably the last month,"" the guitarist admitted. ""Just hearing the way the songs are coming out, seeing the enthusiasm in everybody, seeing the positive reactions we’re getting from playing it for people… I feel like I’m 25 years old again.”Top 30 Glam Metal AlbumsThere's nothing guilty about these pleasures.";2022-04-04;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/skid-row-singer-erik-gronwall/;2022-04-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKSKIDROWBEGANTHINKINGABOUTSINGERERIKGRONWALLFOURYEARSAGO
Ultimate Classic Rock;Bob Dylan Keeps Adding Surprising Songs to His Live Shows;Bob Dylan added some surprise songs to his 2022-23 set lists.;"Bob Dylan is known for shaking up his set lists, often rearranging and reimagining his classic songs to such a degree that they end up not sounding at all like their recorded versions.His current set lists focus on songs from his most recent album, 2020's Rough and Rowdy Ways, as well as a few classic cuts like ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"" and ""Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine"" tossed in.But Dylan isn't just finding new ways to his old songs; he's also been covering cuts from artists like Grateful Dead and Van Morrison. And he keeps adding surprise songs to his live shows, several of which he's never performed before. We take a look at some of those 2022-23 tour highlights below.""Friend of the Devil,"" Grateful DeadDylan's history with Grateful Dead stretches back to the summer of  1987 when they went on a six-date tour together, which resulted in the live album Dylan & the Dead. But Dylan didn't debut his live cover of ""Friend of the Devil,"" from the Dead's 1970 LP American Beauty, until 2022, giving it a slower, more languid feel. ""That Old Black Magic,"" Johnny Mercer""That Old Black Magic"" isn't exactly a new cover for Dylan; he included the Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen classic on his second standards album, 2016's Fallen Angels. But when he played it in Denver in July 2022 — the closing night of his tour's U.S. leg — it was the first time he played it live since 2017. When Dylan launched the European run of the tour, the song earned a regular spot in the set list. ""I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye,"" Jerry Lee LewisDylan doesn't usually acknowledge what's going on across the world at his concerts. But when Jerry Lee Lewis died on Oct. 28, 2022, he broke the silence. ""Jerry Lee's gone, and we're going to play this song – one of his,"" Dylan said just before he and his band launched into 1970's ""I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye."" ""Jerry Lee will live forever. We all know that."" ""Truckin,'"" Grateful Dead""Truckin'"" sounds a little like a Bob Dylan song, with its wordy verses and rough-and-tumble characters, so it's no surprise he's covered it. He debuted his version in Tokyo in April 2023, several months after he wrote about the song in his book, The Philosophy of Modern Song. ""The Grateful Dead are not your usual rock 'n' roll band,"" Dylan noted. ""They’re essentially a dance band. They have more in common with Artie Shaw and bebop than they do with the Byrds or the Stones. Whirling dervish dancers are as much a part of their music as anything else. ... With most bands, the audience participates like in a spectator sport. They just stand there and watch. They keep a distance. With the Dead, the audience is part of the band – they might as well be on the stage."" ""Brokedown Palace,"" Grateful DeadJust a few days after he debuted ""Truckin',"" Dylan performed another Grateful Dead song from American Beauty, ""Brokedown Palace."" He first attempted the song on April 14, 2023, but fell out a few minutes in. ""I thought I knew this song,"" he said before moving into his ""Melancholy Mood."" Four days later, Dylan tried ""Brokedown Palace"" again and made it all the way through. ""Not Fade Away,"" The CricketsBuddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" is a rock 'n' roll staple. First recorded by Holly and his band the Crickets, the song has been covered by Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones and Rush over the years. Dylan performed it in April 2023, the first time he's done so in more than a decade. His history with Holly dates back to January 31, 1959, when an 18-year-old Dylan saw Holly perform in Duluth just a few days before he died in a plane crash. ""From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother,"" Dylan would explain in his 2016 Nobel Prize acceptance speech. ""He was the archetype.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Original Pearl Jam Drummer Dave Krusen Sits in at Concert;Original Pearl Jam drummer Dave Krusen sat in with the band at their concert in Fresno, Calif., on May 16, 2022.;"Pearl Jam gave fans a blast from the past last night at their concert in Fresno, Calif., when they brought up a guest musician: the band's original drummer, Dave Krusen.With Pearl Jam's current drummer, Matt Cameron, off the road after testing positive for COVID-19, Krusen appeared behind the kit for several songs.""When this all went down with Matt the other day, we started thinking about all the other people that — you know, we've been through some great drummers ... some of the best,"" Eddie Vedder said when introducing Krusen. ""You know, that first record [Ten] seems to be a record that affected so many people ... but our friend that was playing drums at that time, the amount of shows that he got to play with us was fairly limited. Well, it looks like this week we're going to get to make up for that.""Krusen, fittingly, played drums on 10 songs, eight of which came from the band's debut album. This was Krusen's first time performing a concert with Pearl Jam since May 25, 1991. He left the group that year due to personal issues and struggles with alcohol. (His only other performance with the group was in 2017 at Pearl Jam's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction.)You can watch fan-filmed footage from the show below.Pearl Jam have been playing with other drummers until Cameron recovers. Last week at two shows, two fans - Josh Arroyo on May 12 and Kai Neukermans on May 13 - sat in on drums for a song. Touring member Josh Klinghoffer and Oakland-based drummer Richard Stuverud have also been taking turns on drums.“It was a last-minute thing, and I didn’t think it was going to work out,” Neukermans told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""My heart started racing when everyone started screaming and my heart skipped a beat.""Other highlights from last night's show included a rare performance of the deep cut “Don’t Gimme No Lip,” sung by guitarist Stone Gossard, and Klinghoffer taking lead vocals for a cover of Prince's ""Purple Rain.""Pearl Jam Opening Night 2022Pearl Jam's long-awaited return to the road took place May 3, 2022.";2022-05-17;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/pearl-jam-dave-krusen-concert-2022/;2022-05-18;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKORIGINALPEARLJAMDRUMMERDAVEKRUSENSITSINATCONCERT

Well … you will see.”You can watch his 2002 rendition of “God Save the Queen” below.While John will appear on video as a result of previously arranged tour commitments, the concert – which will be aired live on the BBC – is also set to feature Nile Rodgers and Diana Ross, among many others.

Ultimate Classic Rock;The Guess Who Tried to Force the Who to Change Their Name;Randy Bachman revealed the Guess Who tried to force the Who to change their name in an April 2022 interview.;"Former Guess Who guitarist Randy Bachman said his old band tried to force the Who to change their name.Although the Guess Who enjoyed their greatest success from 1969 through 1974, the Canadian rockers formed several years earlier and released their first album as ""the Guess Who?"" in 1966. Before that, they released two albums as Chad Allan and the Expressions in 1965 — the same year the Who released their debut, My Generation — though the words ""Guess Who?"" featured prominently on the cover of their sophomore LP, Hey Ho (What You Do to Me!).Considering this timeline, one can see why Bachman might accuse the British rockers of encroaching on their territory. ""When I was in the Guess Who, we found out about this English band called the Who and were determined to force them to change their name,"" Bachman recently told Classic Rock. ""So, we were in London, and the Who were playing at the Marquee club. Down we went to confront them. They were being filmed for German TV at that show, so we had to wait around for about four hours.""Eventually, we get to meet them and say: 'Look, we were here before you. So, change your name, it's confusing people,'"" Bachman continued. ""Pete Townshend looked at us and replied: 'There's the Yardbirds and the Byrds. Nobody's confused by that. So bugger off.'""Despite their inauspicious introduction, the Guess Who and the Who later became ""great friends,"" according to Bachman. ""And that phrase 'bugger off' was our in-joke,"" he added. ""We'd check into a hotel and find out the Who were there, so we'd call up one of the guys at 3AM and when they answered we would say: 'Bugger off!' then hang up. They'd do the same to us.""Bachman first left the Guess Who in 1970 following the release of their biggest LP, American Woman, and went on to enjoy success in Bachman-Turner Overdrive. The Guess Who have continued in various lineups for the past 50-plus years, with drummer Garry Peterson as the sole remaining original member.Top 100 '60s Rock AlbumsHere's a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '60s.";2022-04-27;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guess-who-the-who-name-change/;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKTHEGUESSWHOTRIEDTOFORCETHEWHOTOCHANGETHEIRNAME

The child actor did most of his recording after school; the scripts were right in front of him, and his lines were often short and simple.

The alternative rock pioneers received critical acclaim for the album, which, in the decades since, has come to be regarded as a pivotal release of the era.Despite this, the Replacements were never satisfied with the album.“Even with Tim’s evolving status as an all-time classic, the Replacements remained unsatisfied with the sound of the record, largely centered on the mix done by the album’s producer, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Tommy Erdelyi, aka Tommy Ramone,” noted a press release accompanying the new set’s announcement. “Now, after four decades, the LP has finally been given a long overdue sonic overhaul as part of Tim: Let It Bleed Edition.”Producer Ed Stasium, a longtime friend of Erdelyi, handled the new mix. He believes the Let It Bleed Edition is a “fuller, deeply detailed and ultimately more satisfying version of the record, which finally captures the band’s raw power.""You can hear Stasium's new mix of ""Left of the Dial"" below.“I really loved working on this project,” Stasium noted. “It’s a great record, and now you can hear even better what’s great about it.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Joe Biden Vows to Take on Concert Ticket 'Junk Fees';President Joe Biden vowed to tackle concert ticket processing fees as part of his battle on 'junk fees' in November 2022.;"Music fans frustrated over concert ticket hidden fees have gotten a powerful ally. President Joe Biden recently announced he would be coming after the such “surprise charges” as part of a sweeping new initiative.In a speech on Oct. 26, Biden announced he’d asked his Competition Council to take on “the unfair hidden fees known as 'junk fees' that are taking real money — real money out of your pockets — real money out of the pockets of American families.”Examples the President gave of such “junk fees” included banking overdraft fees, credit card late fees, hotel resort fees and processing fees for concert tickets. The commander-in-chief called such practices “unfair,” describing them as “surprise charges that companies sneak into bills because they can.”In a follow-up tweet on Nov. 3, Biden doubled down on his promise to crack down on such fees.“I know hidden junk fees – like processing fees on concert tickets – are a pain,” the President wrote. ""They’re unfair, deceptive, and add up. That’s why, last week, I called on my Administration to crack down on these fees and put that money back in your pocket.”Biden’s efforts come on the heels of a tumultuous time for the live music industry. The COVID pandemic forced the cancellation of concerts across America, an industry-altering event which had no precedent. Ticketing companies struggled to handle a massive number of refunds. At one point, Live Nation, the country’s largest concert promoter, saw its revenue down 98% from the previous year.As the live music industry has recovered, fans have swarmed back to concerts and festivals. But that excitement has been clouded by high ticket prices, especially to see major artists. Ticketmaster’s “dynamic pricing” strategy has resulted in outrage, with Bruce Springsteen and the reunited Blink-182 ranking among the most expensive tours. Overall, concert ticket prices have increased nearly 20% from their pre-COVID average.Top 100 Classic Rock ArtistsClick through to find out how they stack up, as we count down the Top 100 classic rock artists.";2022-11-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-biden-concert-ticket-fees/;2022-11-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJOEBIDENVOWSTOTAKEONCONCERTTICKET'JUNKFEES'

""Mick and I were really on the same level at that point, same page. And our writing relationship was locked in. And I think those song ideas are some of the best things we've ever written together.”According to Gramm, there are “eight or nine songs,” that he and Jones worked on together. “They just need a little polishing up. And I think they're just about ready [for release].”The singer claims he used to have a copy of the material, but in a twist of fate, he handed it over to Foreigner’s people and has never seen it again.""I spoke to Foreinger's manager, and he mentioned to me that Mick couldn't find his copy of the song ideas,” Gramm explained. “So I told him I had two and I sent him one of mine. Well, the other one that I thought was my copy was something completely different. So now Mick has the copy of the songs, and I don't. And I asked the manager if he could make me a copy, and he said, 'We'll see.' So it's done a complete turnaround where I gave Mick my copy and now I don't have a copy of the songs. And they're obviously not willing to give me one. I had the only copy and I was willing and did send Mick a copy. Now I can't get a copy when I need one.""Gramm expressed frustration over the situation and suggested that his requests for the material have been ignored.“It doesn't have to be like that after all these years of working together. And if those songs are ever gonna see the light of day with me involved, I ought to have a copy, don't you think?”Gramm split from Foreigner at the end of 2002, though he has made occasional guest appearances with the band at various points in the years since. In 2020, Jones stated that releasing the unheard Gramm recordings was “hopefully gonna happen at some point. And in the meantime, [we're] just sitting tight waiting for that opportunity to arise.""""I'd be surprised if they ever saw the light of day,"" Gramm remarked in the new interview.

I've hand-signed each and every art print over the years, and there's never been a problem.""He continued: ""However, in 2019 I had a bad case of vertigo and it continued into the pandemic years. It takes a crew of five working in close quarters with me to help enable these signing sessions, and we could not find a safe and workable way to complete what I needed to do while the virus was raging. So, during the pandemic, it was impossible to sign anything and the vertigo didn't help.""He said that as ""contractual deadlines"" approached, the autopen idea was suggested, ""along with the assurance that this kind of thing is done 'all the time' in the art and literary worlds."" He added: ""Using a machine was an error in judgment and I want to rectify it immediately. I'm working with Simon & Schuster and my gallery partners to do just that."" He signed off: ""With my deepest regrets, Bob Dylan.""Published earlier this month, The Philosophy of Modern Song contains 66 essays on tracks written by other artists, and took him 12 years to bring to market.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Bono's 'Surrender' Memoir Will Highlight 40 U2 Songs;Bono announced his new autobiography 'Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story' in May 2022.;"Bono has announced a new autobiography, Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story.""Surrender is the story of one pilgrim’s lack of progress. . . With a fair amount of fun along the way,” the singer said in a statement. The book's subtitle, 40 Songs, One Story, is a reference to its forty chapters, each one named after a U2 song. The legendary frontman has also created forty original drawings that will appear throughout the book.""When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I’d previously only sketched in songs,"" Bono explained. ""The people, places, and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me.""One of the people who will receive focus in the new memoir is the singer's late mother, Iris Hewson, who passed away four days after collapsing at his father's funeral in 1987. Bono's mother died of complications from a brain aneurysm, and her sudden death is one of the factors that the drove the man born Paul Hewson towards music. Bono has previously addressed the impact of the loss of his mother on such U2 tracks as ""I Will Follow,"" ""Mofo"" and ""Out of Control.""Bono met the Edge and Adam Clayton while the three were attending school in Dublin in the mid-1970s, and had their first band rehearsal as U2 in September 1976. By the singer's own admission, ""surrender"" was a bit of a foreign idea back then. ""Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book,"" the frontman noted. ""I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist.""The rocker's journey has included over twenty years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty, and just recently his social justice efforts expanded to include support for Ukraine in the country's conflict with Russia. Accepting an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Bono and the Edge delivered a surprise 40-minute performance inside a Kyiv subway station that is serving as a bomb shelter. ""We pray that you will enjoy some of that peace soon,"" the Irish rocker told the audience.Bono picked his 62nd birthday on Tuesday, May 10, to share the news of his upcoming memoir. The singer also released an animated clip (see below) in which he narrates an excerpt from the book, reflecting on his 18th birthday in 1978 -- the day Bono started to write “Out of Control.""Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story will be released Nov. 1 and is available for pre-order now.U2 Albums Ranked  U2 don't inspire weak reactions in people.

The film, which you can watch below, includes interviews with several friends, family members and former bandmates, including Derek Scott; bassist Bruce Howe, who played with Scott in his pre-AC/DC band Fraternity; and singer Jimmy Barnes, who replaced Scott in Fraternity and also fronts the Australian rock band Cold Chisel.Scott, who died of acute alcohol poisoning after choking on his vomit on Feb. 19, 1980, at the age of 33, has long been described as a legendarily hedonistic rocker, a reputation reinforced by the interviews in On the Brink. ""He did get bored very quickly,"" Scott said of his brother, whom his family always called ""Ron."" ""That was the biggest problem. When he got bored, he drank. He never worried about tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day.""Howe added that Scott would act recklessly when left to his own devices. ""It was a pattern. He was really, really steady until he got bored and he wasn't working,"" Howe said. ""That's when he would start doing wild things. There was no future, there was only now, and he would take risks on his motorbike. He didn't give a bugger about whether he lived or died the next day.""The bassist said he witnessed a change in Scott when he last saw him near the end of 1979.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Lynyrd Skynyrd Says 'Maybe We Were Wrong' About Retiring;Johnny Van Zant discussed Lynyrd Skynyrd's future in an August 2023 interview.;"Lynyrd Skynyrd announced a farewell tour in 2018, then the pandemic forced them to rethink those plans.""There's a saying in the music business: You don't retire from it, it retires you,"" Gary Rossington said in 2021. ""I have heart problems. I thought I couldn't get around anymore a year or two ago – but I got it all fixed, so now I'm feeling all right.""Unfortunately, Lynyrd Skynyrd's co-founding guitarist continued to experience health issues and was forced to step away from touring that year, though he was able to return for sporadic guest appearances with the band until his death in March 2023.The future of Lynyrd Skynyrd was in doubt. Without any surviving original members, would they continue? The group decided to move forward with their 2023 plans, including a summer tour with ZZ Top.Frontman Johnny Van Zant joined UCR to share memories of Rossington and discuss Lynyrd Skynyrd's longtime friendship with ZZ Top, among other subjects.How's the tour going so far?It’s so early into it, you know? I don’t know if Live Nation thought it was going to do as good or not, but we did fantastic. Hell, I don’t know, it might have been a sellout in West Palm Beach. If not, it was damn close to it. I think people like iconic [bands], and you have two legendary bands together. If I’m a consumer, I’m going, “Hey, I’m going to see them.” I want to see real rock 'n' roll, and that’s what this whole tour is about – getting the music out to the people. After COVID, I think people love and thrive on live music right now. For Skynyrd, we were down for 15 months. We didn’t play a show for 15 months. As artists, I think we appreciate being able to play. Who knows if some other crazy thing will happen? And I think the audience feels the same way. It’s a great healer, for all of us. So far, it’s just been awesome.When did you first come across ZZ Top?I first discovered them way, way back when they had the Worldwide Texas tour, where they had the damn longhorn onstage, the rattlesnakes and the buzzard! Man, that was really the first time I’d seen ZZ. I really didn’t know any of their songs when I saw them for the first time, but I was like, “These cats are badass.” First of all, they’re representing their state, so they must love Texas. For me personally, to be able to become friends with Dusty Hill – when we were out for 11 months, me and Dusty killed off a couple of bottles of Crown Royal a few nights, singing country songs on the bus and having a good time. He was a good dude. We’ve done so many shows with ZZ Top. It’s just an honor and a pleasure to be out here with them.You've been dedicating ""Tuesday's Gone"" to Gary Rossington.There was nothing better for me than when Gary would go into that first [part]. When he passed, we were in a difficult situation. He was coming down to Plant City, where we had a show. I had talked to him. I was at my grandboy’s batting practice. Me and Gary loved baseball. He called me and said, “Hey Bubba!” I was like, “Hey, Brother Man.” He goes, “What are you doing?” I said, “I’m at my grandboy’s batting practice.” He said, “Oh, shit, man. Go ahead on. Enjoy it and call me later.” I didn’t call him, because by the time we got done doing everything, [it was late]. I’ve got big regrets, [because] he passed on that Sunday and that [call] was on that Saturday. We had to play a show after he’d passed. He was supposed to come down to that show. We were going, “OK, we’ve got to cancel.” His wife was like, “Gary’d kick y’all’s butt if you canceled.” So we went out and played the show after his passing and then came back, and I buried my brother. He’s buried in Jacksonville.What was special about him as a guitar player?He played like he looked. [Laughs] I always said that. For some reason, he could hold those strings, kind of like Billy Gibbons. Billy has got his style; nobody else can play like he does. Gary had a bluesy, soulful thing. He was that part of Skynyrd, with those long notes holding – but then again, he could play something like “Gimme Three Steps.” Gary was a different guy. He was kind of an introvert and didn’t like the hype of the music business. He just wanted to play guitar, and that’s how he played. Looking back, Stevie Gaines and Allen Collins played way different than him, but he was the blues soul bottom guy to the band.This year marks the 50th anniversary of Lynyrd Skynyrd's first album. [Van Zant's older brother, Ronnie, was the band's original singer and died in the 1977 plane crash that killed five others.] What do you remember about the early days? I think about me as a kid, watching it – because hell, they used to rehearse in my parents’ living room. It was just kids being kids. I don’t think anybody would have dreamt that it would have gone as far as it has and would have made as much impact, myself included. It was funny, because the guys in the band, they were all teenagers. They couldn’t cuss or drink if I was around. [Laughs] So they were always like, “Get the hell out of here, so we can do all of this cool stuff!"" But man, there’s just fond memories. It blows my mind that it actually took off. The first record came out and did OK, enough to get ‘em a second record, which was Second Helping. When “Sweet Home Alabama” hit, people went back and said, “Oh, they’ve got another record?” They fell in love with the first record. It just started steamrolling from that point on. Of course, until the plane crash happened – but no matter what, the guys in Skynyrd have always been really normal guys. Nobody was born with a silver spoon. They had to work hard for this, and it’s great for myself to be able to help carry this legacy on. It blows my mind. I never wanted to be in this situation. I wish the plane crash wouldn’t have happened, and my brother would have been here. Who knows what it could have been or what it might have been? But we don’t judge what God has in store for us. There’s an old line, “If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.” Because it ain’t yours; it’s all his. But it’s been an amazing trip.Lynyrd Skynyrd had announced a farewell tour, but you're still touring. How many miles are left on the road?I want to be upfront with you. We were on our last year – 2020 was really going to be our last year. It was like, OK, we’ll go out and maybe do two or three shows after that or do some charity work. We were [in our] last year and COVID hit. We were like, “Well, shit. This is great.” We sat at home for 15 months and when those months were up, we were obligated to finish off the dates that we had booked. So we said, “OK, well, let’s reform and get back out there and put everybody back to work.” We got back out there and went, “You know what? We really missed this.” We missed seeing our fans. Gary was a big part of that. He was like, “I don’t want to sit at home. COVID retired me for 15 months and I didn’t like it.” [Laughs] That’s all he’s ever done. That’s all any of us have ever done. So we said, “OK, maybe we were wrong about that.” I’ve come to a conclusion: Musicians never retire; they just play less shows. We’ll see where the heck the future goes. There isn’t a thing happening right now that Gary didn’t know about, and he wanted it to happen. So we’re going to fulfill those wishes and we’ll see what the future brings.Top 25 Southern Rock AlbumsFor all of its woolly, trapped-in-the-'70s imagery, the genre has proven surprisingly resilient.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Sum 41's Life-Changing Performance With Rob Halford and Tommy Lee;Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley recalled his band's life-changing performance with Rob Halford and Tommy Lee in April 2023.;Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley looked back at his performance alongside Rob Halford and Tommy Lee, calling it the “single most important moment” in his band’s career.The gig took place in August 2001 during a special televised event celebrating MTV’s 20th birthday. In a recent interview on the Tuna On Toast With Stryker podcast, Whibley recalled how it all came together.“That was the single most important moment in our career and in our lives at that time,” Whibley admitted. “Because we were a relatively still unknown band, the song [‘Fat Lip’] was starting to go, but it wasn’t a hit or anything yet, and we were lucky enough to get to be able to play that show and we were the opening of the whole night. So we were such fans of what we’d seen on MTV Awards and things of these collaborations of artists. So when we got our first opportunity to do something on MTV, we asked them, ‘Can we do a medley and ask some other artists to come out?’ And they were, like, ‘Great!’’With MTV’s blessing, Sum 41 put together a wish list of collaborators.“We said Tommy [Lee], we said Rob Halford, we said the Beastie Boys and we asked for Slash,” Whibley revealed. “Slash said no, Beastie Boys said no, but Tommy and Rob said yes. So then all of a sudden we were like, ‘They said yes? So now we gotta do this thing?’ I mean, we just kind of threw that out there. We didn’t think it was actually gonna happen.”Watch Dereck Whibley Discuss Sum 41's Performance With Tommy Lee and Rob HalfordThe members of Sum 41 got to work putting together a medley of tunes. They’d start with their song “Fat Lip” before rolling into Beastie Boys’ “No Sleep Till Brooklyn,” Motley Crue’s “Shout at the Devil” and Judas Priest’s “You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’.”“We didn’t really have much time to get it together,” Whibley revealed. “We had one rehearsal the night before. So Tommy flew in and Rob came in and we worked on this thing. We ran it a few times. We left the rehearsal thinking, ‘I think we have it. I mean, we’ll see.’”Whibley admitted he and his bandmates were “shaking backstage” moments before the show started. “I don’t think I’d ever been as nervous in my life yet.”Then, Sum 41 proceeded to step into the spotlight, triumphantly rocking through the medley with two of their idols joining them. Lee was rolled onto the stage on a riser during “No Sleep Till Brooklyn” and remained to pound away for the remainder of the performance. Halford, meanwhile, appeared for “You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’,” much to the delight of the crowd.The performance, which you can watch below, proved life-changing for Sum 41.“It just felt like the rest of the night everyone was congratulating us. Everyone was saying, you have no idea, this is so big for you guys,” Whibley recalled. “And from the next day, everything sorta took off. The [‘Fat Lip’] video went into heavy rotation, the song went up the charts, and it just kinda went worldwide, and it just kinda took off.”Judas Priest Albums RankedThey don't call 'em Metal Gods for nothing.;2023-04-25;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sum-41-rob-halford-tommy-lee/;2023-04-26;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKSUM41'SLIFE-CHANGINGPERFORMANCEWITHROBHALFORDANDTOMMYLEE
Ultimate Classic Rock;Michael Anthony: Scrapped 'VH III' Sequel Had 'Really Good' Songs;Michael Anthony discussed the making of Van Halen's ill-fated 'Van Halen III' with Eddie Trunk in March 2023.;"Michael Anthony recently reflected on the ""strange time"" Van Halen had while making the ill-fated Van Halen III and said its shelved follow-up had some ""really good"" songs.""I remember Alex [Van Halen] was going through a divorce,"" the bassist told Eddie Trunk on a new episode of SiriusXM's Trunk Nation. ""And there'd be times where we'd start up in the studio and he ... would record for a half hour, then have to leave to meet with his lawyer.""Van Halen III marked the band's only album with then-former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, following the departure of Sammy Hagar. It marked a major sonic departure and was received lukewarmly by fans and critics, going only gold after a string of multiplatinum successes.Still, Cherone reportedly had good chemistry with the rest of the band and gamely collaborated with Eddie Van Halen. ""Gary actually moved into the guest house up there by Ed,"" Anthony told Trunk. ""And Ed would be calling him in the middle of the night, all hours of the day, saying, 'Hey, I've got an idea for this!' And Gary grew a little old of that, so he finally moved out of the house there.""Listen to 'Without You' From 'Van Halen III'The late guitar hero co-produced Van Halen III with Mike Post, better known for composing TV themes including Law & Order, The A-Team, NYPD Blue and Magnum, P.I. Anthony suggested that Post had a negative influence on the recording process, which was more fractured than previous Van Halen albums.""He was trying to influence Ed on certain things, so it was just a really strange, strange, strange time,"" he explained. ""One thing that was really kind of sad for me was that there was not even a handful of songs that the band actually recorded together in the studio. And before that, we used to record everything with everybody in the studio.""Van Halen released Van Halen III in March 1998 and embarked on a supporting tour that ran through November. Cherone left the following year, halting progress on a follow-up album that reportedly sounded more in line with typical Van Halen fare, according to multiple band members.""They were a little bit more straight-ahead, what Van Halen sounds like,"" Anthony said of those unreleased songs. ""A couple of things — I can't remember what the working titles were — there were a couple of things that we did not include on Van Halen III that I thought were sounding really good, that ended up not being used."" Cherone told Trunk the same thing back in 2020. ""It was more in the strike zone of Van Halen,"" he said. ""The stuff that we were coming out with, we were actually comfortable writing. ... It was in the strike zone of VH or the classic VH stuff. It was good.""Anthony is gearing up for a performance this weekend benefiting Save the Heartbeat, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by congenital heart disease. The show will take place on Saturday at the Tiki Bar in Costa Mesa, Calif.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Why the Doobie Brothers Are Covering Steely Dan's 'Pretzel Logic';Patrick Simmons discussed the Doobie Brothers' updated 50th-anniversary tour set list in an exclusive June 2023 interview.;"The Doobie Brothers have always had deep connections with Steely Dan.They shared a guitarist in Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter, then a singer in Michael McDonald. McDonald appeared with Steely Dan's Donald Fagen in the early 2010s as part of the Dukes of September. The Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan toured together in 2018.For all of this history, however, the Doobie Brothers had no overt link to the title track from Steely Dan's platinum-selling Top 10 1974 album Pretzel Logic. Baxter appeared elsewhere on the LP, but Walter Becker and Dean Parks handled guitars during that particular session. McDonald wouldn't begin contributing key background vocals for Steely Dan until 1975's Katy Lied. Instead, future Eagles member Timothy B. Schmit is featured on ""Pretzel Logic.""Then a critical absence altered the Doobie Brothers' extended 50th-anniversary tour: Original frontman Tom Johnston left the road because of a back injury just before shared dates with successor McDonald resumed in May. He was scheduled to undergo surgery, and doctors said Johnston ""should not be performing at this time."" The Doobie Brothers expect Johnston back on stage once he recovered. In the meantime, however, they were forced to rethink the set list.Favorites like ""Rockin' Down the Highway"" and ""Another Park, Another Sunday"" from Johnston's early years fronting the group were swapped out for songs featuring others. They also began covering Steely Dan's ""Pretzel Logic,"" beginning on May 25 at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida.The Doobie Brothers' Pat Simmons tells UCR that the decision traces back to a missed invitation to join Steely Dan onstage during their shared tour.A few years ago we were touring with Steely Dan. We have a long history with these guys starting around 1972 when we both were fledgling bands attaining our first taste of national attention with the release of our albums “Toulouse Street” and “Can’t Buy A Thrill.” We became friends, and of course, everybody probably knows Jeff Baxter ended up in our band after departing from the Dan around 1974-75. A couple of years later Michael McDonald, who had been playing and recording with Steely Dan, came to help us out when Tom Johnston was forced to leave for health reasons. It is fortunate Michael stayed, and the rest is history.Here we are 50 years later, and once again Tom has to take a break for, hopefully, this time, a much shorter period. And thank goodness Michael is back with us again. He’s been back for a couple of years now, and not only have the fans been thrilled with our live show, but we’re in the process of making new music for release next year as well. So nice to have all three writers and singers together, and an incredible bunch of seasoned musicians out here performing.Temporarily at least, it’s once again fallen to Michael and myself to pull the music together until Tom returns. We knew that we needed to step up and deliver the best show we could for the fans. No doubt people will be expecting something extra to make up for Tom’s absence. There are certain songs we were forced to drop, but we brought back some material that we used to perform in the old days, as well as surprises that I know our fans will appreciate.When we were out with Steely Dan, Donald Fagan asked us if we would like to sit in on their last tune, which happened to be “Pretzel Logic.” Because of the logistics of travel, and getting out before the crowds to the next concert location, we were never able to get out there for the jam. Sometimes we might be pulling out of the venue as they began the song. I was always regretful because the idea of sitting in with Steely Dan was incredibly cool, and the song just had this low-down killer-in-the-pocket blues groove that made it so compelling, as well as interesting chord changes that enabled simple blues guitar licks to have so much more melodic breadth.When we were adding the new tunes to the set, I suggested the track to the guys as maybe a bonus tune to present wherever we felt the audience deserved a little extra. So far that’s been at most of the gigs! People want to hear more, and that’s what we’re there for. We embrace the ride-out as an opportunity to jam and stretch out a little, and it really works for us and the audience. Everybody seems to do a double-take when we start the song. “Are they really doing that? Yes, they are! Holy shit!”This Doobie Brothers tour reunited Johnston, McDonald, Simmons and guitarist John McFee for the first time in 25 years. North American shows are scheduled to run through October, with concluding dates in Canada.The Most Awesome Live Album From Every Rock LegendSome of these concert recordings sold millions of copies, while others received little fanfare.

Ultimate Classic Rock;McCartney, Hynde Join Foo Fighters at Hawkins Tribute Concert;Paul McCartney and Chrissie Hynde joined Foo Fighters to play two Beatles classics during the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert on Sept. 3, 2022.;"Paul McCartney and Chrissie Hynde took the stage during the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert in London, joining Foo Fighters during their closing set to perform two Beatles classics.Dave Grohl was coy, first introducing Hynde, ""who I happen to think is the baddest motherfucker in the world. But she brought a friend with her tonight. So would everybody please welcome Miss Chrissie Hynde — and our good friend, Mr. Paul McCartney. Please give them some love!""There was a momentary delay for the pair as they waited for drummer Omar Hakim to materialize. ""We could do it without a drummer,"" McCartney joked. ""I don't know, I guess he's at the pub.""Hakim took his place shortly after that, and the band launched into the Beatles' ""Oh! Darling,"" from 1969's Abbey Road. McCartney quipped that it was a song he'd recorded ""a hundred years ago"" but had never done as a duet.Hynde then left the stage, and McCartney dug down deep to deliver a characterically shredding vocal on ""Helter Skelter,"" with Grohl tossing in the occasional vocal line as the rest of the Foos blazed through the Beatles classic.Although McCartney was not announced as one of the event’s performers, rumors of his involvement began spreading online Friday when a Foo Fighters fan account uploaded video from outside Wembley Stadium. Rehearsal of “Helter Skelter” could be easily heard in the background.That McCartney would be involved with the event is not surprising. The Beatle has become good friends with Foo Fighters over the years, collaborating with the band on various occasions.McCartney and Grohl became friends after the Foo Fighters frontman attended 2002’s Concert for George. “I don’t know what it feels like to see a UFO. I don’t know what it feels like to see a ghost. I don’t know what it feels like to see Bigfoot, but I know what it feels like to see Paul McCartney, and if that’s not a supernatural event, then I don’t know what is,” Grohl once reflected of that night.McCartney also appeared in the 2012 documentary Sound City and contributed to its soundtrack. The song “Cut Me Some Slack” — which Macca recorded alongside surviving Nirvana members Grohl and Krist Novoselic in a group dubbed Sirvana — won a Grammy for Best Rock Song.In 2017, McCartney replaced Hawkins in the studio for one song, recording drums on Foo Fighters’ “Sunday Rain.” ""He hadn't even heard the song,” Hawkins once recalled of the session. “He comes in and Dave picked up and acoustic [guitar] and showed him real quick. He sat on his special drum set that his tech set up for him. I sat there with a drumstick conducting. He did two takes.""McCartney inducted Foo Fighters into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, joining the band to rock through “Get Back” as the night’s festivities came to a close.When Hawkins died in March, the former Beatle penned a heartfelt tribute to the drummer, recounting their times together.""Taylor’s sudden death came as a shock to me and the people who knew and loved him,"" McCartney wrote. ""Not only was he a GREAT drummer but his personality was big and shiny and will be sorely missed by all who were lucky to live and work alongside him.“I was asked by the Foo Fighters to play on one of their tracks. It turned out that they wanted me to play drums! — on one of Taylor’s songs. This request came from a group with TWO amazing drummers! It was an incredible session and cemented my relationship with Taylor and the guys. Later they asked if I would induct them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I sang with them on 'Get Back'. Taylor provided a powerhouse drum part. I’ll never forget that night.""All of which made it much more of a desperately sad shock to hear he had died. So thanks Taylor for sharing some glorious minutes with me. You were a true Rock and Roll hero and will always remain in my heart.""Foo Fighters Albums Ranked From the one-man-band debut to their sprawling, chart-topping classics, a look at the studio releases by Dave Grohl and band.";2022-09-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/paul-mccartney-taylor-hawkins-tribute/;2022-09-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKMCCARTNEY,HYNDEJOINFOOFIGHTERSATHAWKINSTRIBUTECONCERT

The show also included a virtual duet of “I’ve Got a Feeling” with John Lennon – a moment McCartney described as “so special” despite its technological nature. Video clips and the full set list are available below.After having already delivered 26 song, he told the crowd: “I’ve got a little surprise for you. Your hero from the west coast of America – Dave Grohl!” The guest received a rapturous applause before deadpanning: “Hi Paul. How are you?” then asking the audience “How are you?” The pair performed the Beatles classic “I Saw Her Standing There” followed by Wings' hit “Band on the Run.” Grohl revealed he’d endured two flight cancellations in order to be at Glastonbury. “But I swear, I would never miss being right here with you right now,” he told McCartney.Watch Paul McCartney Virtually Duet With John LennonWatch Paul McCartney and Dave Grohl Perform ‘I Saw Her Standing There’Immediately after Grohl left the stage, McCartney said: “We’ve got another surprise for you, from the East Coast Of America,” before introducing Springsteen.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Robert Trujillo Will Put Kirk Hammett’s EP Through Vinyl Ceremony;Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo told how he liked to christen vinyl records and looked forward to doing it with Kirk Hammett's EP 'Portals' in April 2022.;"Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo revealed the ceremony he puts every new vinyl record through, and said he couldn’t wait to do it with bandmate Kirk Hammett’s solo EP.Portals was just released in association with Record Store Day. To mark the event’s 15th anniversary, Trujillo and Hammett shared their passion for the format in a panel talk moderated by Variety.“The fantasy world that was created through vinyl and through the images of the album art and then the music itself was just all-encompassing,” Trujillo said. “And to this day, when I [get] a vinyl record, I go to my tour assistant, Jeff Bass, who is a vinyl enthusiast that loves audio gear, and I actually christen a new album on great gear.”He continued: “I’m going to do this with Kirk’s record – I am going to sit there and I’m gonna play that record and I’m gonna close my eyes and it takes me on a journey. And I love that that can happen again now. It faded for a while, but it feels like it’s back, and…vinyl is strong again.”The bassist went on to recall visiting record stores with his parents as a kid. “It was just this fantasy world, driven by the music itself, but also seeing the album covers,"" Trujillo explained. ""They become part of that chapter in your life. Abraxas by Santana was the first album I ever bought, and if you look at that album cover, it’s insane. What does it mean? You’ve got these beautiful naked people on there and you’re a little kid going, ‘Wow.’ At the same time you’ve got this table of fruit and these conga drums and these indigenous characters, and it was just really fascinating to me.“But then my friend’s older brother had the first couple of Black Sabbath records, so if you look at that cover and you hear the song ‘Black Sabbath’ and you look at that cover… do it tonight and you will get scared, I promise.”For his part, Hammett enthused about visiting an independent store’s import section when he was young, because he couldn’t find the music he wanted in mainstream shops. “‘Wow, this great Tygers of Pan Tang album! Oh wow, Motorhead – these guys look scary; this must be good,’” he recalled thinking.“That’s how I discovered the type of music that went on to influence me the most and shape my artistic career. And I have very unique memories of putting records on turntables and just picking up the needle and putting it down again, trying to learn a song on guitar.

This 50th Anniversary Tour and release will represent that journey and the forks along that road.”Another Fork in the Road shares its name with a new career-spanning compilation, Another Fork in the Road – 50 Years of Kansas, that's available now.The trek kicks off June 2 in Pittsburgh and winds its way across the States before ending Jan. 28 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Robert Fripp Recalls Jimi Hendrix's Two Compliments;Robert Fripp recalled the time he was honored by Jimi Hendrix, then discovered a bigger honor 12 years later in August 2022.;King Crimson leader Robert Fripp can be heard recounting the story of the one time he met Jimi Hendrix and was paid two compliments, although he knew about only one at the time.The audio clip below is taken from one of Fripp's spoken-word performances, as he gears up for another round of similar shows alongside his manager, David Singleton.Fripp explained that he met Hendrix at the Revolution Club in London in 1969 (although the date and location have been disputed by some fans). At the time he thought he was paid a great compliment, but years later he discovered he was given an even bigger one.He started by saying it was the first time he sat down onstage, a position he maintains to this day. “I’ve always been a seated guitar player, and to work in a rock group you couldn’t sit down?” he said with surprise. “‘No one sits down to play guitar!’ But I felt, I think it was about after 12 performances … it was impossible for me to stand and play. So I said, ‘Look, I’ve got to sit down,’ and Greg Lake said, ‘You can’t sit down – you’ll look like a mushroom!’ My considered opinion was that the mushroom is a fertility symbol in many cultures!”After using a newly purchased black stool for King Crimson’s first set, Fripp recalled that “backstage, a man came up to me in a white suit, with his right arm in a white sling. One of the most luminous people I’d ever met. And he came up to me and said, ‘Shake my left hand, man – it’s closer to my heart.’” It was Hendrix.Listen to Fripp tell the story below.Hendrix died in September 1970, but it wasn’t until 1981 that Fripp heard another part of the story from that night in 1969. He went for a drink with the sister of original Crimson drummer Michael Giles after meeting her accidentally in a bookshop. “She said to me, ‘Do you remember the time when Hendrix came to see King Crimson?’” Fripp recounted. “And I said, ‘Of course I do – it’s my Hendrix story!’ And she said, ‘Do you know that I was sitting on the next table to Jimi Hendrix. … He was jumping up and down and saying, “This is the best group in the world.”’Fripp noted, “In all due modesty, that is one of the best calling cards any working musician is ever likely to be able to present.” His An Evening With That Awful Man and His Manager tour starts in Toronto on Sept. 16 and ends in Chicago on Oct. 9.Top 50 Progressive Rock ArtistsFrom Kansas and Can to King Crimson and Curved Air.;2022-08-05;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/robert-fripp-jimi-hendrix/;2022-08-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKROBERTFRIPPRECALLSJIMIHENDRIX'STWOCOMPLIMENTS
Ultimate Classic Rock;Bob Dylan Sells Masters Estimated to Be Worth $200 Million;Sony Music acquired Bob Dylan’s entire back catalog of recorded music, estimated to be worth $200 million, it was announced in January 2022.;Sony Music has acquired the rights to Bob Dylan’s entire back catalog of recorded music along with the rights to “multiple future new releases,” the company has announced.Both parties reached their agreement last July. The financial details of the deal have not been disclosed, but Billboard estimates Dylan’s master recordings to be worth $200 million or more, based on an estimated $16 million in global annual revenue and a presumed sale “for a multiple of about 15 to 20 times annual revenue.”The agreement comprises Dylan’s entire body of recorded work, including 39 studio albums — from his 1962 self-titled debut through 2020’s Rough and Rowdy Ways — as well as his 16-volume “Bootleg Series” and various singles. The sale of Dylan’s masters follows the sale of his publishing rights to Universal Music Publishing Group in December 2020, a deal estimated to be worth $300 million or more.“Columbia Records and [Sony Music Group chairman] Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records,” Dylan said in a statement. “I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.” Stringer added that “Columbia Records has had a special relationship with Bob Dylan from the beginning of his career” and praised the singer-songwriter as “one of music's greatest icons and an artist of unrivaled genius.”In recent years, record labels and publishing companies have been keen to snap up legacy artists' publishing rights and master recordings for eye-popping sums. Last month, Bruce Springsteen sold his masters and publishing catalog for a combined $500 million. Other recent catalog sales include Motley Crue ($150 million), Neil Young ($150 million for half his catalog) and ZZ Top ($50 million).Rockers Who Have Sold Their Publishing RightsAs song placement has become commonplace and sales have decreased due to streaming, many classic rockers have offloaded their publishing rights.;2022-01-24;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-sells-masters-200-million/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKBOBDYLANSELLSMASTERSESTIMATEDTOBEWORTH$200MILLION

Ultimate Classic Rock;Hear Roger Waters' Haunting New Version of 'Comfortably Numb';Roger Waters released 'Comfortably Numb 2022,' an update of the classic Pink Floyd song, in November 2022.;"Roger Waters has released a new version of the classic Pink Floyd song “Comfortably Numb.” Titled “Comfortably Numb 2022,” this update takes on a more ominous tone than the original.“During lockdown, I made a demo of a new version of ‘Comfortably Numb’ as an opener for our new show This Is Not a Drill,” Waters said in a news release. “I pitched it a whole step down, in A Minor, to make it darker and arranged it with no solos – except over the outro chord sequence, where there is a heartrendingly beautiful female vocal solo from Shanay Johnson, one of our new singers.”Ten musicians contributed to “Comfortably Numb 2022,” delivering strings, percussion, bass, guitar and more. Waters co-produced the track, as well as handling vocals. You can listen to the new song below.Originally included on 1979's The Wall before being released a single in 1980, “Comfortably Numb” remains one of Pink Floyd’s best-known songs. Its lyrics were inspired by an incident in 1977 when Waters, suffering from hepatitis, was injected with tranquilizers before taking the stage to perform. ""That was the longest two hours of my life,"" he later told Rolling Stone. ""Trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm.""""Comfortably Numb"" also holds a unique place in Pink Floyd history: They closed a reunion show at Live 8 in 2005 with this song, and that would be the last performance for Pink Floyd's classic quartet lineup. Richard Wright died three years later.More than four decades after its release, “Comfortably Numb” is still a consistent part of Waters’ solo set lists. His This Is Not a Drill tour continues into Europe in 2023, with 40 shows across 14 countries beginning March 17 in Lisbon, Portugal.David Gilmour and Roger Waters Solo Albums Ranked  They both laid claim to the Pink Floyd legacy, while only rarely stepping out with solo works.Why Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and Roger Waters Are Still Fighting";2022-11-18;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/roger-waters-comfortably-numb-2022/;2022-11-20;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHEARROGERWATERS'HAUNTINGNEWVERSIONOF'COMFORTABLYNUMB'

It's time!""  You can listen to the song below.With a concert schedule that rarely lets up, Cooper wanted to bring the sounds of the stage to the studio, recording the songs on Road with his current live band. ""I wanted to show off the touring band, so we wrote songs, went in the studio, and I said, 'Here's the deal on this album: No overdubs,'"" he told UCR. ""I said, 'Everything has to be done in the studio live because the whole idea of this album is showing off how good this band is live.' So when you hear this album, it sounds like a studio album, but it's actually them playing live in the studio.""The veteran artist once again worked with longtime producer Bob Ezrin on Road, but he also made sure his bandmates — guitarists Ryan Roxie, Nita Strauss and Tommy Henriksen, bassist Chuck Garric and drummer Glen Sobel — were a major part of the writing process. ""In the past, the show got reviewed before the music did,"" Cooper said in an advance statement about the record. ""We had hit No. 1 albums, but it was always about what we did onstage. For Road, I wanted the band to be involved in the foundation of all the songs.""The shock rocker is currently on a brief run opening for Motley Crue and Def Leppard.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Lindsey Buckingham Announces Fall US Tour Dates;Lindsey Buckingham announced a run of fall U.S. tour dates in August 2022.;Lindsey Buckingham has announced a run of fall U.S. tour dates, scheduled to commence after his previously announced shows in Europe.The acclaimed guitarist and singer will hit the road for 17 Stateside concerts, beginning with an Oct. 26 performance in Bristol, Tenn. After largely sticking to the western part of the country during his spring tour, Buckingham will wind through the Midwest, East Coast and South during his fall trek, which wraps on Nov. 19 in Augusta, Ga. The full list of dates can be found below.Buckingham is continuing to tour in support of his 2021 self-titled release. The album was his seventh solo effort and first since his messy 2018 departure from Fleetwood Mac. The rocker underwent open-heart surgery in 2019, a procedure which left him with vocal damage he feared might be permanent (thankfully, that wasn’t the case). The Fleetwood Mac firing and health scare both led Buckingham to spend more time at home than he was accustomed to, an experience which influenced Lindsey Buckingham.“My solo work is often more esoteric, and you lose nine out of 10 listeners because you're disconnecting from their idea of what Fleetwood Mac is. But I wanted to make a pop record here,” Buckingham noted around the time of the album’s release. “I wrote these songs when my wife and I had been together a long time,” he explained. “Things drift. Suddenly, you're at a point where everyone is pulling to reboot the entire scenario of domestic life. That's something that happens. So while a lot of these songs are celebrating long-term relationships, they're doing it in a non-romanticized way.”Lindsey Buckingham Fall 2022 U.S. TourOct. 26 - Bristol, Tenn. @ Paramount Center for the ArtsOct. 27 - Louisville, Ky. @ Kentucky Center for the Arts (Brown Theatre)Oct. 29 - Des Moines, Iowa @ Hoyt Sherman PlaceOct. 31 - Eau Claire, Wis. @ University of Wisconsin Eau Claire (Pablo Center at the Confluence)Nov. 01 - Green Bay, Wis. @ Meyer TheatreNov. 03 - Nashville, Ind. @ Brown County Music CenterNov. 04 - Elkhart, Ind. @ Lerner TheatreNov. 06 - York, Pa. @ Appell Center for the Performing ArtsNov. 07 - Huntington, N.Y. @ The ParamountNov. 09 - Port Chester, N.Y. @ The Capitol TheatreNov. 10 - New London, Ct. @ Garde Arts CenterNov. 12 - New Brunswick, N.J. @ State Theatre New JerseyNov. 13 - Annapolis, Md. @ Maryland Hall for the Creative ArtsNov. 15 - Roanoke, Va. @ Jefferson CenterNov. 16 - Durham, N.C. @ Carolina TheatreNov. 18 - Nashville, Tenn. @ CMA Theatre (Country Music Hall of Fame)Nov. 19 - Augusta, Ga. @ The Bell AuditoriumFleetwood Mac Solo Albums Ranked  There have been more than 40 of these outside projects, which deepen and add to the band's legacy.;2022-08-19;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lindsey-buckingham-fall-tour-2022/;2022-08-24;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKLINDSEYBUCKINGHAMANNOUNCESFALLUSTOURDATES
Ultimate Classic Rock;Flea Reveals Why He Doesn’t Like Fans Asking for Photos;Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea explained why he didn't like fans asking him to pose for photos with them in August 2022.;"Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea revealed why he doesn’t like fans asking him for photos.He explained his attitude to the situation in a series of tweets after a fan known as Luke posted a short video, taken at a distance, of a conversation he and some friends had had with Flea and singer Anthony Kiedis.“Thank you (and AK) for being so kind and genuine while meeting us,” Luke wrote. “You both are such rays of sunshine; you didn’t have to stop and chat but you did and I hope you know that you really impacted our lives. we love you and AK with all of our hearts!”The comment led to other fans telling Luke that it was rare for Kiedis to stop for a conversation, although the other band members were well-known for doing so. “Wow, that makes the meeting with him and Flea way more special,” he responded. “Perhaps he just felt comfortable in that moment; none of my friends nor I asked for a photo or autograph or anything – we just talked, so maybe that had to do with his interaction with us.”Flea tweeted: “It’s because you all generated a kind and gentle light, and you didn’t ask for a picture. We are always down to talk and chat; asking for a photo ruins it instantly.” Another fan then asked what was wrong with people asking for photos. “There’s nothing wrong with it,” the bassist said. “But it ruins having actual conversation. It is a transaction.”Another follower argued: “Posing for a quick picture shouldn’t be a chore. For fans, meeting you guys is such a memorable moment that they want to capture it and value it forever. I’m pretty sure you’ve wanted photos alongside your heroes?” But Flea replied: “I have never asked anyone to take a photo with me once in my life.”The Chili Peppers are currently on tour, ahead of releasing Return of the Dream Canteen – their second album this year – on Oct. 14.Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Ranked Funk rockers have delivered some timeless classics ... and a couple of forgettable releases, too.";2022-08-05;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/dont-ask-flea-for-photos/;2022-08-10;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKFLEAREVEALSWHYHEDOESN’TLIKEFANSASKINGFORPHOTOS
Ultimate Classic Rock;Richie Faulkner Toured While Waiting for Second Heart Surgery;Richie Faulkner discussed touring with Judas Priest while he waited for a second open heart procedure in September 2022.;"Richie Faulkner said he got his doctors’ permission to tour with Judas Priest while he waited to undergo a second open heart procedure and noted the band had canceled only one concert while he dealt with his health issues.The guitarist required emergency surgery last year after collapsing with a ruptured aorta during the band’s performance at the Louder Than Life Festival in Kentucky in 2021. Recalling the incident in a social media post, he explained that he went under the knife again six weeks ago.“It’s crazy how one minute you’re listening to the crowd singing ‘War Pigs’ – everything normal, everything seemingly fine – the next it turns out that it was almost the last time I ever heard it,” Faulkner said of his collapse. “I’m fortunate and grateful to be here a year later typing this. My support system at home, the hospitals and of course from all you metal maniacs has been second to none and I thank you all.”But, he continued, “I’m not completely out of the woods yet. Just before we toured Europe, scans showed a hole in one of the connections between the synthetic graft and my own aorta that was causing a leak. The blood from the leak was forming an 8cm sack that was surrounding my heart.”The road trip kicked off in May and ended in Belgium on Aug. 7, and Faulkner confirmed his “doctors were OK” with him taking part. “But as soon as I got back I had to go under again for another open heart surgery. So three days after we played Belgium, they went in, removed the sack and fixed the leak.”He said he was feeling “well and strong” and looking forward to Priest’s upcoming North American dates. “My surgeons were always confident that it was enough time for me to recover and get back out on the road,” he added. “And it seems like they were right. We had to lose Aftershock Festival [in California in October] in order for me to recover, but it looks like it’s still gonna be a kick-ass festival.”He advised: “Look after yourselves and your loved ones; you never know what’s round the corner.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust' Gets Reggae Makeover on New Tribute LP;Easy Stars All-Stars previewed their upcoming David Bowie reggae tribute album 'Ziggy Stardub' with a cover of 'Starman' in January 2023.;"David Bowie's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars will receive a reggae makeover on a forthcoming tribute album titled Ziggy Stardub, courtesy of the Easy Star All-Stars collective.Helmed by producer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist and Easy Star Records co-founder Michael Goldwasser, Ziggy Stardub will feature a wide range of guests, including Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson and Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid. It follows Easy Star All-Stars' previous reggae takes on Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, Radiohead’s OK Computer and the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.Lead single “Starman,” led by British vocalist Maxi Priest, can be heard below.“I listened to Ziggy Stardust as a teenager but once we decided to do it as the tribute album, I listened to it like crazy,” Goldwasser told Rolling Stone. “I thought about elements from the original songs, the little details that would be cool to interpolate or just copy into the new versions because I want people to listen many times over and hear different things every time. David Bowie was a genius but in order to do what I do, it takes a certain level of craziness to execute every detail of every arrangement, and then keep track of the big picture.”Goldwasser added that “Starman” was “the song most pivotal to the loose storyline of the original album,” and he knew it would require an adept vocalist. “The chorus of ‘Starman’ has this lift that really draws people in because it jumps an entire octave from the ‘star’ to ‘man,’” he explained. “We needed an accomplished singer who could do something like that. It’s not easy, and I suspected Maxi could pull that off, and, of course, he did.”Easy Star All-Stars will release Ziggy Stardub on April 21.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Kansas' Phil Ehart on 50 Years: 'Not Ready to Hang It Up Yet';Kansas drummer Phil Ehart talked to UCR about the band's 50th anniversary and compilation 'Another Fork in the Road' in December 2022.;"Mention the American progressive rock band Kansas and such major hits as “Carry on Wayward Son,” “Point of Know Return” and “Dust in the Wind” immediately come to mind. But arguably their most important song is perhaps obscure to casual listeners: the energetic and explosive “Can I Tell You,” which first appeared on the band’s 1974 self-titled debut album.“That was the song that got us our recording contract [with Kirshner Records],” Kansas drummer Phil Ehart tells UCR. “Don Kirshner heard that song on our demo tape and said, ‘That's why I want to sign you to a recording contract.’”Decades later, Kansas — whose present lineup consists of founding members Ehart and guitarist Richard Williams, plus bassist Billy Greer, violinist David Ragsdale, singer Ronnie Platt and keyboardist Tom Brislin — has recorded a new version of “Can I Tell You.” It appears on their latest release, Another Fork in the Road, a three-CD career compilation that came out on Dec. 16 and celebrates the 50th anniversary of the band's formation. “That was something that me and Rich kind of talked about,” Ehart says about revisiting the song.“I said, ‘It would be cool to rerecord something that we recorded 50 years ago, but let's rerecord it with today's band.’ We were like 19 when we were recording that track. And the thing just hauls. I mean, it's really smoking. We thought, 'Well, we hope the drummer can keep up with it.’ Well, let's see, that’d be me. It was a real accomplishment to go in there all these years later and play at the same tempo. We're very, very pleased with it.”The new version of “Can I Tell You” opens Another Fork in the Road, which Ehart and Williams helped curate. Containing music from their 1974 debut through their most recent album, 2020’s The Absence of Presence, the anthology was an idea from the band's current record label Inside Out. It not only contains hits and fan favorites, but deep cuts from later albums such as Vinyl Confessions (1982), Drastic Measures (1983), Freaks of Nature (1995), Always Never the Same (1998) and Somewhere to Elsewhere (2000).Listen to Kansas' 'Can I Tell You (2022 Version)'“I said, ‘Look, we want you guys to do this,'” Ehart recalls telling Inside Out. “And they were kind of put back a little bit as far as, 'What now?' ‘Richard and I want you guys to choose the songs. You're fans. You guys put on there what you like.’ And so they did. Richard and I were blown away by the job they did. They got all those songs and then they had to license them. So there was a lot of work involved. And then they got involved in the cover. We’re very proud of it and extremely, extremely thankful to them for doing something like this.”Fittingly, the new anthology is dedicated to the band's original violinist and co-lead singer Robby Steinhardt, who died last year at the age of 71. “When Robby passed, it was rough,” Ehart says. “He'll always have a special meaning to all of us. And we were very proud to dedicate the album to him. We thought it was the right thing to do.”Formed in 1973, Kansas originally featured Ehart, Williams, Steinhardt, singer/keyboardist Steve Walsh, guitarist Kerry Livgren and bassist Dave Hope. Ehart still fondly remembers when the band from Topeka, Kan., made its debut album for Kirshner Records at New York City's Record Plant in 1973. “Don Kirshner got us on his program [Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]. We got out on the road with Queen and were up and going,"" he recalls. ""We went to New York and we didn't even have a road manager. It was just the guys in the band. The next day we were at the recording studio. We were in there with Aerosmith, and Yoko Ono and John Lennon were recording in there. Here we are, just bumpkins from Kansas. It was surreal. We all survived and came home and hit the road for a long time. And then we did another long run with Queen also. So we were very fortunate to get with great bands and get out there.”It was Kansas' third album, 1976's Leftoverture, that broke the band into the mainstream, thanks to the success of hit single “Carry on Wayward Son.” Its follow-up, 1977's Point of Know Return, featured another enduring Kansas classic in the iconic ballad “Dust in the Wind.” (Both “Carry on Wayward Son” and “Dust in the Wind” are featured on Another Fork in the Road as live versions). They and other classics like “Song for America,” “Icarus - Borne on Wings of Steel” and “Play the Game Tonight” remain concert staples and will likely appear on the band's 50th-anniversary tour next year.“Rich and I are working on the set list right now,” says Ehart, “trying to do something that's not the same old, same old. But in the same sense, you got to have the same old, same old. You got to have 'Dust in the Wind,' 'Point of Know Return,' 'The Wall.' But there will be a lot of older tracks in there. There'll be a lot of newer ones that we haven't played as much. So it's not going to be that far from Another Fork in the Road. It's going to kind of follow that guideline as to what we play and what we have in our set list. There's a lot of material there, and we're going to mine all of it.”Listen to Kansas' 'Carry on Wayward Son'Kansas has survived major personnel changes over the decades, with Ehart and Williams keeping the group's legacy alive. To Ehart, it's always been about the music rather than one or two particular members. “It's been 30 and 40 years since some original members have even been in the band,"" he says. ""Billy Greer has been in the band longer than the original members that aren't with us anymore. We always just concentrated on making it about the music. It was never ‘Kansas featuring this guy or this guy.’ No, it's just Kansas. We're still Kansas. So if you want to come and hear Kansas, we're your huckleberry. We're that band.”Ehart says the current state of the group — with longtime members Greer and Ragsdale and newer guys Platt and Brislin — is great, as evidenced by the positive reception to their last two albums, 2016's The Prelude Implicit and The Absence of Presence. “Hopefully, we'll get to do another [new album]” the drummer says. “That's what's so great about Inside Out, is they're there for us. So the opportunity is there. It's just that right now, the band is very popular on the road. When you go on to make an album, that takes you off the road. And so it's what we have to be careful [about] when we come off the road, that we've got everything organized and all the material is written. So we're working as a touring band right now [and] hoping to have another new album when it's ready to go.”Looking back at 50 years of Kansas, whose music still gets played on the radio and streaming platforms as well as being featured in film and TV, Ehart expresses gratitude. But, he adds, “We're not ready to hang it up yet. We want to keep the band going. And we have great musicians in the band, all good guys. We have a great time out there and it's fun.”Top 100 '70s Rock AlbumsFrom AC/DC to ZZ Top, from 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' to 'London Calling,' they're all here.";2023-01-16;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kansas-phil-ehart-50-years-interview/;2023-01-16;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKKANSAS'PHILEHARTON50YEARS:'NOTREADYTOHANGITUPYET'
Ultimate Classic Rock;Genesis, 'BBC Broadcasts': Album Review;A review of Genesis' 2023 compilation, 'BBC Broadcasts.';"The Genesis vaults, it seemed, were bone-dry — a fact crystalized by the prog-pop band’s 2021 compilation, The Last Domino? — The Hits. Released as a sort of cash-grab souvenir shrug tied to their long-awaited reunion tour, the package featured precisely zero unheard material, not one intriguing bonus nugget that justified its shelf space. Just another variation of the same idea: We got nothin', but ... how about this? (We all bought it anyway, of course. Desperate times…)That's part of what makes BBC Broadcasts, the band's latest archival set, a genuine revelation: Few of us probably saw it coming. The career-spanning project — issued across five CDs or, in condensed form, three LPs — collects material recorded by the U.K. radio giant between 1970 and 1998. Most of it's new to fans, and almost all of it is essential listening for die-hards.Even though there are some major gaps in the chronology (only one track between the crucial prog years of 1972 and 1978, nothing between the slicker stretch of 1980 to 1987), BBC Broadcasts still presents a solid overview of the Genesis evolution. It opens with a trio of previously released non-album tracks (the dainty, folky ""Shepherd,"" ""Pacidy"" and ""Let Us Now Make Love"") recorded in 1970 for the Night Ride program. It ends during a live show from the widely ignored Calling All Stations era, with two dramatic tracks (""Not About Us,"" ""Dividing Line"") fronted by the briefly tenured Ray Wilson in 1998.The big-ticket moments, just like with the studio catalog, fall in between. Several of those come courtesy of renowned radio presenter John Peel, who hosted the band in January and September 1972. These songs, some of the most unfairly overlooked from the Peter Gabriel era, are at times more lively than their album counterparts (""Harlequin,"" from that year's Nursery Cryme, offers clearer vocal harmonies and a fuller Hammond organ sound), and often way richer sonically (""Harold the Barrel,"" from the same LP, makes the original sound like a demo).The traditional live recordings are equally vital, often showcasing subtle arrangement tweaks. A 1978 version of the Zeppelin-like ""Squonk"" from the Knebworth Festival ends with a jazzier, funkier rhythm section, as live guitarist Daryl Stuermer peels off a glorious bent note; ""Dance on a Volcano"" from the same gig, is faster and more frenetic, with the guitars and synths punching with an almost feral intensity.But one particular show, the band's famed (and widely circulated) 1980 performance at London's Lyceum, makes this set worth any price tag. Fidelity, creativity, emotion, uniqueness of set list — it checks every box. ""Say It's Alright Joe"" is stretched out to its dynamic extremes, from languid to laser-worthy; ""Turn It on Again"" is heavier than the Duke version, hurtled forward by insane synth-bass; the band seems to be having a blast toying with the prog epic ""One for the Vine,"" with Phil Collins adding some intensely syncopated kick-snare fills and Tony Banks letting his electric piano pirouette like a ballerina.The Lyceum show is the apex of the Genesis live catalog, and it's a pleasure to own it properly. You could say the same for BBC Broadcasts. Is the vault fully clear? Time will tell. Either way, no one could fault them for stopping here.Top 50 Progressive Rock Albums From 'The Lamb' to 'Octopus' to 'The Snow Goose' — the best LPs that dream beyond 4/4.";2023-03-02;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/genesis-bbc-broadcasts-album-review/;2023-03-05;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKGENESIS,'BBCBROADCASTS':ALBUMREVIEW

""They pulled a crowd because of the bite, the sheer bite, of that.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Michael Anthony Says He's Been in Van Halen Tribute Tour Talks;Michael Anthony discussed the rumored Van Halen tribute tour in May 2022.;"Michael Anthony said he's been in talks with Alex Van Halen and David Lee Roth about a rumored Van Halen tribute tour, though the plans didn't get far.The prospect of a tour honoring late guitarist Eddie Van Halen made headlines last month when former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted said he'd been approached by Alex about participating, with Joe Satriani handling guitar duties. ""How could you?"" Newsted said at the time. ""There's nobody that can top it, so how do you show it honor? I didn't want it to be viewed as a money grab. And then it kind of just all fizzled.""In a new interview with The Mitch Lafon and Jeremy White Show — where he also discussed his Mad Anthony hot sauce and first time meeting Sammy Hagar — Anthony said he was surprised to learn of Newsted's involvement because he'd also been discussing a tour with his former bandmates and longtime Van Halen manager Irving Azoff. ""The only thing that was kind of a surprise to me was the Jason Newsted thing when he came out and said that Alex had talked to him last year or something like that,"" Anthony said. ""Which is kind of interesting, because I actually had been talking on a conference call with Irving Azoff, Alex and Dave last year, so I don't know what the Jason thing was all about.""Anthony also confirmed that Satriani was involved in these talks, but any potential plans were still in the primitive stage. ""I spoke to Joe about it, and it was more, you know, just something kicking around,"" the bassist said, adding that Alex Van Halen was still ""mourning"" the loss of his brother.""I hope something happens in the future here,"" Anthony continued. ""I think Joe was mentioning in some of the interviews that it's more a celebration of the band and of the music than calling it 'Van Halen.' Obviously, Eddie being probably the most integral part of the whole band, you can't really call it Van Halen after that.""Anthony's comments support previous statements by Satriani and Roth regarding a potential tribute tour. ""For me, it was a terrifying prospect of doing something like that, but I realized that it was something that would be a real labor of love for me,"" Satriani said last month. ""I was just so honored to take on the challenge.""Roth, meanwhile, told Van Halen News Desk in a statement, ""In my mind, 'Van Halen 4k,' in the age of COVID, is going to require two of us for every position.

Ultimate Classic Rock;7 Tear-Jerking Moments From the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert;A list of seven tear-jerking moments from the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert that took place in London in September 2022.;"Foo Fighters hosted an assembly of rock’s biggest stars Saturday night (Sept. 3) during the Taylor Hawkins tribute concert in London.While the event was much more of a celebration of life than a mournful affair, emotions naturally ran high. That’s to be expected given the circumstances. In March, Hawkins’ tragic death sent shockwaves through the music world, as fans and fellow musicians alike were stunned by the unexpected loss.A Rock & Roll Hall of Famer thanks to his work with the Foo Fighters, Hawkins was extremely passionate about music. The drummer regularly forged friendships with other musicians, including those whom he grew up idolizing. He also mentored younger artists, lending his own knowledge to future stars.The London tribute concert featured many moments of humor, happiness, poignancy and sorrow. Below, we’ve rounded up seven tear-jerking moments from the incredible show.YouTubeYouTubeloading...Dave Grohl’s Opening SpeechThe Foo Fighters were welcomed with a thunderous ovation as they walked on stage to welcome fans at Wembley Stadium, as well as those watching at home. Before Dave Grohl could even get a word out, thousands of fans in attendance began chanting “Taylor! Taylor!” prompting the frontman to take a moment to let the sound wash over everyone.“Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we’ve gathered here to celebrate the life, the music, and the love of our dear friend, our bandmate, our brother, Taylor Hawkins,” a visibly-moved Grohl then said. “For those of you who know him personally, you know that no one else can make you smile, or laugh or dance or sing, like he could. And for those of you that admired him from afar, I’m sure you’ve all felt the same thing. So, tonight, we’ve gathered with family and his closest friends, his musical heroes and greatest inspirations to bring you a gigantic fucking night for a gigantic fucking person. So, sing, and dance, and laugh and cry and fucking scream, and make some fucking noise so he can hear us right now.”YouTubeYouTubeloading...Rush Honors Two Drumming IconsHawking idolized Neil Peart, and was understandably crushed when the Rush drummer died in 2020. As Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson joined Grohl and Greg Kurstin during the tribute concert, they made note of both departed drummers.""So, for Alex and I, it's a privilege to be up here to play with Super Dave, and Greg,"" Lee explained. ""In 2008, as Dave told you, we got a call from Foos' management, asking if we'd come to the Toronto show and show up so that Taylor could play one of his favorite Rush songs with us. We obliged and that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. So tonight, in honor of that — and in honor of our own lost brother,"" Lee added, in a nod to Peart, ""we'd like to play that song.""The group then rocked through a powerful rendition of ""YYZ.”YouTubeYouTubeloading...Brian May Conjures the Spirit of Freddie MercuryQueen was one of Hawkins’ biggest influences, and though he eventually became close friends with Roger Taylor and Brian May, the drummer never seemed to lose his sense of fandom for the band. The Queen stalwarts delivered a dynamic five-song set in celebration of Hawkins, with May’s rendition of “Love of My Life” serving as an emotional high point.“What an amazing evening of love and music – thank you for being here and for sharing all this stuff,” the guitarist declared as he took a seat with his acoustic guitar. “In 1986 we were on this exact spot, singing this song together, and in 1992, 30 years ago, we said goodbye to Freddie in a style similar to this. So I know Freddie would be happy to share this song in the memory of Taylor Hawkins.”Thousands in attendance joined May as he performed the classic Queen ballad, with the guitarist encouraging them to hold up their cell phones. “Let’s light up Wembley Stadium for Taylor Hawkins,” the rocker declared, his instructions resulting in a display both stunning and heart wrenching.YouTubeYouTubeloading...Times Like TheseWhile the event was engrossing from the start, fans were undoubtedly waiting on pins and needles for the Foo Fighters to perform their own material. The group had not taken the stage together since Hawkins’ death, and anticipation was high for their return. The band opted to begin their set with “Times Like These,” the moving tune off of 2002’s One by One. The song started in heartbreaking fashion, as Grohl, Hawkins bandmate and closest friend, struggled through the emotion of the moment. Through tears, the frontman sang the tune’s first two verses, the audience seeming to lift him up with every word. After the second chorus, Grohl and the rest of the Foo Fighters let loose, delivering a loud, cathartic second half of the song.YouTubeYouTubeloading...Macca Gets Choked UpPaul McCartney has certainly dealt with his fair share of personal tragedies over the years, but nobody -- regardless of how successful or revered they are -- ever becomes numb to such loss. So, when McCartney came on stage to join the Foo Fighters for a pair of songs, the former Beatle got choked up explaining what the evening meant to him.“God bless Taylor,” the icon declared, his voice wavering as he addressed the crowd. McCartney then announced a duet with Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, who joined him on stage. “Me and Chrissie are gonna do a special song here that I haven’t done since we recorded it a hundred years ago. I’ve never done it as a duet. But we’re gonna do it tonight, for the first time, for you.” The two singers, joined by Foo Fighters, then performed the Beatles classic “Oh! Darling.”YouTubeYouTubeloading...A Different Hawkins Takes the SpotlightMost of the drummers who stepped behind the kit during the tribute concert are already legends. Yet, it was a musician most fans had likely never seen before who delivered one of the night’s most touching performances. Shane Hawkins, Taylor’s 16-year-old son, took his father’s chair behind the Foo Fighters and looked like a natural doing so. The young Hawkins seemed energized to honor his dad when he first arrived on stage, but Grohl motioned to him to pause for just a moment to appreciate all the love the crowd was bestowing on he and his family. After a breath, Hawkins -- showcasing much of the charisma and talent that made his father a star -- led the band through a soul-stirring rendition of “My Hero.”YouTubeYouTubeloading...EverlongThe final song of the night was arguably the Foo Fighters’ most beloved track, “Everlong.” But while the tune has traditionally been a raucous closing number during previous Foo Fighters shows, it took on a deeper sense of reflection here.Much like he had started the Foo Fighters set, Grohl opted to end the show performing solo. The frontman, clearly exhausted from a long and emotional evening, earnestly thanked fans for joining them to celebrate one of his closest friends. The crowd sang along as Grohl crooned the classic tune, and as the final notes of “Everlong” were played, the frontman delivered a simple message.""I love you Taylor,"" Grohl proclaimed. ""Let's hear it big and loud for Taylor fucking Hawkins!""Foo Fighters, The Forum, Los Angeles";2022-09-04;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/taylor-hawkins-tribute-concert-london-moments/;2022-09-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCK7TEAR-JERKINGMOMENTSFROMTHETAYLORHAWKINSTRIBUTECONCERT
Ultimate Classic Rock;Ralph Macchio Recalls 'Karate Kid' 'Rocky' Crossover Idea;Ralph Maccio recalled a movie pitch that would have put his 'Karate Kid' character Daniel LaRusso in a film with Rocky Balboa in October 2022.;Actor Ralph Macchio has revealed some of the many pitches he received to revive his Karate Kid character Daniel LaRusso, including one idea that would have teamed him with Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky Balboa.In an excerpt from his new memoir Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me (shared by EW), Macchio looked back at all the ways people suggested reviving his classic character.“I can't begin to share all of the pitches and ideas I had heard over thirty years on how and why I should return to the LaRusso well,” the actor noted, detailing ideas that featured everything from Mr. Miyagi as a ghost, to LaRusso raising his drug-addicted teen son.But Macchio’s favorite failed pitch came when he was having lunch with some studio executives and director John Avildsen, who had helmed both The Karate Kid and Rocky. “I remember the enthusiasm with which the writer gave his ‘elevator pitch’ to John, me, and the studio execs,” Macchio recalled, before paraphrasing the idea: “What if Rocky Balboa had a kid and Daniel-san had a kid and they were both f---ups and you, Ralph and Stallone, come together between New Jersey and Philadelphia to join in a Miyagi/Mickey style of fight training. People would go nuts!”The pitch left Macchio stunned. “A pregnant pause. It seemed to last for ten minutes, though it was probably only four seconds.”Shockingly, the actor sensed that the studio executives – thinking more about profits than plot points – might actually be open to such an absurd idea. “My mind raced to gather visions of Stallone and me running through the slums of Newark,” he remembered thinking.It was at that point that Avildsen spoke up. “John burst into laughter, simply responding that it would not work and was a forced idea,” Macchio recalled. “I believe he diplomatically said he wasn't interested in combining those two franchises or those characters.”For more than 30 years, Macchio declined opportunities to revisit LaRusso, admitting that he was “extremely protective” of the character. He eventually returned to the role in the series Cobra Kai, which launched in 2018 and has become a hit for Netflix. The show's fifth season premiered in September.28 Classic Films That Were Turned Into (Mostly Failed) TV ShowsMany classic '70s and '80s flicks have spawned TV series - but few have found success.;2022-10-13;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ralph-macchio-karate-kid-rocky/;2022-10-15;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKRALPHMACCHIORECALLS'KARATEKID''ROCKY'CROSSOVERIDEA
Ultimate Classic Rock;20 Years Ago: The Black Keys Play Their First Concert;The Black Keys' first public concert took place on March 20, 2002.;"When Black Keys guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Pat Carney played their first concert on March 20, 2002, they looked out on an audience that had, as Auerbach's dad described it, ""a lot of elbow room.""It took place at Cleveland's Beachland Tavern, where the Akron-based duo had set up a show shortly after managing to secure its first record deal with the small Los Angeles label Alive. Run by rock critic Greg Shaw, the company was releasing records by MC5, the Germs and GG Allin, among others, and had signed the Black Keys without ever hearing them perform live.""We were completely nervous,"" Auerbach told Rolling Stone during a 2015 documentary film about that first show. ""Even though I had played so many gigs before, I was always just playing covers, and it was usually in a place where I was just, like, background music.""Carney had also performed in public with other bands but as a guitarist; he'd never played drums in front of anyone before. Ten years later, Carney confessed that his drumming style has always been a mostly haphazard approach. “I suck at the drums, so it’s terrifying,” he said to Rolling Stone in 2012. “Just trying to keep it together. I see a lot of comments on Twitter and stuff about how ugly I am, how bad I am at the drums, how awkward I look, and I’m, like, yeah, I agree with most of those things.""Still, a sizable portion of that first show's attendees were familiar with the newly formed band. ""Half of those people were our friends,"" Carney told Relix in 2014. Audience members included the duo's parents, who watched as their sons poured everything they had into their debut. ""As a parent, your heart breaks,"" Carney's mother recalled. ""They're busting their butt, and we're the only people here.""Fueled by adrenaline, the Black Keys blew through half an hour of scheduled music in about 15 minutes. As Auerbach remembered it, both he and Carney ""kind of blacked out"" while they were performing. It was only after they finished and headed backstage that they considered how wild the experience had been.However rambunctious and poorly paced that first performance was, it struck a chord with Beachland Ballroom and Tavern co-owners Mark Leddy and Cindy Barber. They booked the band for another show. ""The people that saw them started to fall in love with them one after another,"" Barber recalled in the Rolling Stone documentary. ""And the talk just started to buzz around northeast Ohio: 'You gotta see the Black Keys, you gotta see the Black Keys.'""The publicity helped when the band's debut album, The Big Come Up, came out just a few months later on May 14, 2002, selling 500 copies in a month — not much compared to major-label acts, but a considerable leap for two unknown guys from Akron.As Auerbach later noted, there was a ""natural connection"" between himself and Carney, both onstage and on record. “There’s some sort of code in our brains that was similar enough that helped us do what we do,"" he said in 2014. ""When we first got together, it sounded like music right from the get-go.""Black Keys Albums RankedFrom lo-fi 8-track recordings to multiplatinum hits, a roundup of every studio LP by the blues-rock duo.";2022-03-31;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/black-keys-first-concert-2002/;2022-03-31;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCK20YEARSAGO:THEBLACKKEYSPLAYTHEIRFIRSTCONCERT
Ultimate Classic Rock;Warren Zevon's Children React to His Rock Hall Nomination;Warren Zevon's children discussed his Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nomination, rejecting the idea he wouldn't have cared about it in February 2023.;Warren Zevon’s children discussed their reaction to his posthumous nomination for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, rejecting the idea that he wouldn’t have cared about it.He died in 2003, nine years after becoming eligible for the honor, but he's never been listed among the contenders until this year. In a new interview with Billboard, his son Jordan and daughter Ariel – both musicians – reflected on the delay.“Jordan might have had this similar experience where some of the fans ask me [about it] in this, like, accusatory way, like I’ve stood in the way somehow, allowing [the omission] to happen,” Ariel said. “And It’s like, ‘No, I would love it. It’d be great!’ So, yeah, I’m especially thrilled for all of those fans who have been pounding their fists saying, ‘Why hasn’t this happened yet’ It’s great for them.”“I’ve respected the choices that they’ve made,” Jordan said of the nominating committee. “It’s been such a broad range of people that I kind of didn’t think it would happen. I thought he was worthy of it, but it seemed like there were so many boxes they were trying to check that getting around to Dad might not have happened. It was such a grassroots thing, people rooting for it, that I was excited for them.”He added that “there’s this misconception that Dad wouldn’t have cared. I think maybe, to be blunt, the later records didn’t sell a million copies - that didn’t mean he hated the industry. It just meant he was on the fringes because he wasn’t Britney Spears. But he wouldn’t have been, like, ‘Who cares about that?’ It’d be like, ‘Hey, Johnny, hey, Ariel, guess what?’ It would have been, ‘It’s a big deal.’ It was his business. He wanted to be good at it. You want to win, you know, best plumber of the year!”Both noted that their kids, in their teens and 20s, were delighted with Zevon’s nomination, although Ariel noted that her daughter’s main interest was whether Billie Eilish might be at the ceremony. Neither had known about the letter Billy Joel wrote to the committee supporting Zevon’s addition to the shortlist, but Ariel suggested “it would be cool” if Joel took part in her father’s induction, if it takes place. “OK, we’ll put that one out there,” Jordan agreed.Artists Who Should Be in the Rock and Roll Hall of FameLet's pause for a moment to recognize the many artists who've yet to be recognized.;2023-01-28;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/warren-zevon-hall-of-fame-children/;2023-02-02;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWARRENZEVON'SCHILDRENREACTTOHISROCKHALLNOMINATION
Ultimate Classic Rock;Ozzy Osbourne and Joan Jett Will Appear in Workday Super Bowl Ad;Ozzy Osbourne and Joan Jett were announced as stars of Workday's Super Bowl commercial in January 2023.;"The Prince of Darkness and the Godmother of Punk will both get some screen time during the Super Bowl as Ozzy Osbourne and Joan Jett will appear in a commercial for Workday.It’s the first time the business focused, cloud based software vendor has created an advertisement for the big game, and they opted to go with a rock star theme for their debut spot.In a teaser for the ad (which you can watch below), two coworkers whisper about “the new guy” who is “supposed to be some kind of rock star.” The camera soon reveals Osbourne at a nearby desk, asking which of his fellow workers would like a piercing.The theme is also evident in another teaser clip, this time with musician Gary Clark Jr. When a businesswoman exits her office, she turns and praises her coworker saying, “You are a rock star!” only to have both the white collar worker and Clark Jr. say thanks.Jett was not showcased in either of the commercial teasers, though she is confirmed to be a part of the Super Bowl spot.

Several hundred fans attended the unveiling of the monument.""It's a very special place for me,"" Johnson said in a video statement sent to RTBF, noting that he hopes to visit the statue in person sometime soon. ""It was the first night I sang with AC/DC, and I was a very nervous boy.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Rock Hall Curator Allegedly Tried to Sell Stolen Eagles Lyrics;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi was one of three men indicted over the attempted sale of stolen Eagles lyrics in July 2022.;"Three men, including a curator for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, have been indicted for allegedly trying to sell stolen handwritten lyrics by Eagles co-founder Don Henley valued at over $1 million.According to court documents, nearly 100 pages of Henley’s notes, including lyrics to “Hotel California” and “Life in the Fast Lane,” were stolen in the late 1970s by an author hired to write a biography of the band.Craig Inciardi, Glenn Horowitz and Edward Kosinski are accused of conspiring to sell Henley’s pages through auction houses, even though they knew the items were stolen.Rolling Stone notes that it was Horowitz who acquired the Eagles documents in 2005. He then allegedly recruited Inciardi and Kosinski in an effort to “sell off the documents to various auction houses, as well as trying to ‘coerce’ Henley into buying back the property that rightfully belonged to him.”Inciardi is the curator and director of acquisitions at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He previously worked for the auction house Sotheby’s before joining the Hall’s staff.All three men have been charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree, which carries up to a four-year prison sentence. Inciardi and Kosinski were also charged with criminal possession, while Horowitz was charged with attempted criminal possession of stolen property and two counts of hindering prosecution. All three men pleaded not guilty.“The DA’s office alleges criminality where none exists and unfairly tarnishes the reputations of well-respected professionals,” the defendants’ attorneys said via statement. “We will fight these unjustified charges vigorously. These men are innocent.”Meanwhile, Eagles manager Irving Azoff told Rolling Stone the indictments expose ""the truth about music memorabilia sales of highly personal, stolen items hidden behind a facade of legitimacy.”“No one has the right to sell illegally obtained property or profit from the outright theft of irreplaceable pieces of musical history,” he continued. “These handwritten lyrics are an integral part of the legacy Don Henley has created over the course of his 50-plus-year career.”The Best (and Worst) Song From Every Eagles AlbumWhich ones go the distance?";2022-07-12;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-curator-stolen-eagles-lyrics/;2022-07-13;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKROCKHALLCURATORALLEGEDLYTRIEDTOSELLSTOLENEAGLESLYRICS
Ultimate Classic Rock;Watch Iron Maiden's Prop Plane Malfunction During 'Aces High';Iron Maiden's Spitfire plane replica malfunctioned during their concert on Oct. 17, 2022.;"Iron Maiden experienced a Spinal Tap moment on Monday night when their Spitfire replica plane malfunctioned during their set-closing performance of ""Aces High.""The Powerslave opening track has been a fixture of Iron Maiden's ongoing Legacy of the Beast World Tour, which began in 2018. The song — which previously opened the band's set and now closes it — features a 90% scale replica of a Spitfire, the single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force during World War II.Typically, the Spitfire ""flies"" (i.e. floats) above the band during ""Aces High."" But during Tuesday's performance at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass., the plane appeared to get stuck on its way to the front of the stage. Fan-shot footage, which you can watch below, shows the wings failing to extend fully, and the plane hovering awkwardly near the back of the stage before crew members deflate it and hide it from view. Singer Bruce Dickinson can be seen glancing back at the Spitfire as it flails and flapping his arms during the guitar solo after it has retreated from the stage.Iron Maiden is no stranger to stage prop mishaps. The band's 1986 Somewhere on Tour trek featured a giant inflatable version of mascot Eddie dressed as the futuristic bounty hunter seen on the cover of that year's Somewhere in Time. Eddie's head was supposed to inflate underneath drummer Nicko McBrain, while Dickinson and bassist Steve Harris were supposed to be raised on platforms in the palms of Eddie's hands at the sides of the stage. Unfortunately, the technology of the age was not quite advanced enough to match the band's ambition every night.""This was the 'Great Inflatable' tour,"" Dickinson told Classic Rock in 2016. ""Dave Lights was still doing our lighting stuff, and he was well into inflatables. He had a bit of an inflatable megalomania, in fact. He built inflatables that were so big they wouldn't actually fit inside the sodding buildings! We had two big hydraulic hands, which would raise up – not Spinal Tap at all! – with big Eddie claw hands that would inflate.""As for Eddie's inflatable head, Dickinson recalled, ""It was great except when the pressure started to go and it looked a bit like a saggy bin liner. Ha ha ha!""The Legacy of the Beast World Tour concludes on Oct. 27 in Tampa.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Def Leppard Goes Classical With 'Drastic Symphonies' Album;Def Leppard announced the classical-style album 'Drastic Symphonies' will releasae in May 2023.;Def Leppard announced the release of Drastic Symphonies, an album that presents some of the band’s classic songs as classical pieces.The band has “deconstructed and rebuilt not only some of their most well-known tracks but also some of their hidden gems as well,” a statement explained. “By and large, they have intertwined the audio from the original tapes and performed them alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The album includes new vocals and guitars which culminates in stunningly beautiful symphonic arrangements. At different points, you can hear Joe Elliott duetting with his younger self.”The 15-track LP, created in collaboration with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, arrives on May 19. You can see a track listing below.The lead song, a new version of “Animal,” can be heard below.Singer Elliott said, “Def Leppard has always enjoyed veering off the expected path - working with the likes of Tim McGraw, Taylor Swift and Alison Krauss, for example. So when the offer to revisit some of our back catalog with the Royal Philharmonic was presented to us, to a man we all jumped at it. ... Although we’re far from the first band to ever do this, working directly with an orchestra at Abbey Road on some of our more orchestrated songs seemed too good of an opportunity to pass up.”Guitarist Phil Collen added that “we didn’t just want an orchestra plonked over our previous recordings. We decided to create something special where we would have something classic, but present it in a brand-new way.” He said the process included “recording new parts, remixing previous sounds, taking some of our instruments out so the orchestra could breathe and literally making a new album.”Drastic Symphonies will be available in CD, double vinyl, limited color double vinyl, picture disc, CD/Blu-ray and digital formats. It’s available for preorder now.Def Leppard With the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Drastic Symphonies' Track Listing1. “Turn To Dust”2. “Paper Sun”3. “Animal”4. “Pour Some Sugar on Me” (Stripped Version)5. “Hysteria”6. “Love Bites”7. “Goodbye For Good This Time”8. “Love”9. “Gods Of War”10. “Angels (Can’t Help You Now)”11. “Bringin’ On the Heartbreak”12. “Switch 625”13. “Too Late for Love”14. “When Love & Hate Collide”15. “Kings Of the World”16. “Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad” (Not on all versions)Def Leppard Albums Ranked  From their metal-edged debut to their pop breakthrough to the recent records, we rank every single LP.;2023-03-16;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/def-leppard-drastic-symphonies-album/;2023-03-17;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKDEFLEPPARDGOESCLASSICALWITH'DRASTICSYMPHONIES'ALBUM
Ultimate Classic Rock;John 5's Rock Credentials: From David Lee Roth to Motley Crue;A look at the career of John 5, who was named Motley Crue's new guitarist in October 2022.;"For the first time in more than 40 years, Motley Crue has a new guitarist. Just a day after Mick Mars announced he was retiring from touring, the band revealed his replacement: John 5.The name is likely familiar to ardent rock fans, while more passive listeners may be left scratching their heads. Still, there’s no question 5’s resume is impressive, as the guitarist has played with some of the biggest names in rock.John 5 – real name John Lowery – began his career in 1987 when he was still just a teen. Early on, he connected with Rudy Sarzo, the famed bassist whose career includes stints in Whitesnake, Quiet Riot and Ozzy Osbourne’s band. Sarzo recruited 5 for his short-lived band Sun King, though the group never released an album. Still, 5 had his first entry into the rock world, and his career would progress steadily from there.The guitarist would become part of Lita Ford’s band in the ‘90s, a gig which helped 5 meet his idols, Kiss. To be fair, 5 had actually come face-to-face with Gene Simmons before: when the future rocker was 13, he followed the Kiss bassist into a hotel elevator, but was too starstruck to ask for an autograph.Following his stint with Ford, 5 joined forces with Rob Halford, who at the time was no longer a member of Judas Priest. The famed frontman formed an industrial-metal project called 2wo, with 5 serving as the group’s guitarist. 2wo’s first and only album was produced by Trent Reznor, but despite the star power involved, the LP failed to garner much attention. By 1998, the group had disbanded, but 5’s next big gig was just around the corner.Watch John 5 Perfomring With Rob Halford in 1998After reading David Lee Roth’s memoir, 5 decided to cold-call the former Van Halen singer’s management.""I said, 'Are you guys accepting any [music] right now or anything like that?'"" 5 later recalled. ""And they said, 'Well, not really. But you can send a CD, and we'll see what we've got.' And I was, like, 'Oh my God!' Just that little bit, I was shocked. I was, like, 'This is insane.'""The guitarist’s demos impressed Roth’s team so much that he was invited to Diamond Dave’s home.""And there's Dave in his overalls,"" 5 remembered. ""And he's, like, 'John, great to see ya. We're gonna make a record. I really like what you're doing.' And I was, like, 'Oh my God.' I couldn't believe it."" 5 would end up playing lead guitar and co-writing half the songs on 1998’s DLR Band.Listen to 'Slam Dunk' by David Lee Roth, Featuring John 5Also in ‘98, 5 joined Marilyn Manson’s band (it was Manson who gave him the John 5 moniker). He’d remain a member of the group for six years, contributing to the albums Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000) and The Golden Age of Grotesque (2003) before departing in 2004.The guitarist’s next endeavor would prove to be the longest of his career. In 2005, 5 joined Rob Zombie’s band, initially just as a temporary gig. However, the two musicians hit it off so well that 5 became a permanent member. He co-wrote eight of the 11 tracks on 2006’s Educated Horses, and contributed to a total of five of Zombie’s studio albums during his tenure, which ended in 2022.Watch John 5 Performing With Rob Zombie in 2005Parallel to his career with Zombie, 5 began releasing solo material, delivering 13 albums from 2004 to 2021. The releases boasted some impressive guests, with Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Billy Sherwood, Dave Mustaine, Jim Root, Tommy Clufetos and Billy Sheehan among the contributing musicians.Over the years, 5 has also collaborated on various material with a long list of icons, including Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, Alice Cooper, Sebastian Bach, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rod Stewart, Scorpions, Steve Perry and Steven Adler.Watch John 5 Performing Motley Crue's 'Kickstart My Heart'Even before his recent addition to the Motley Crue lineup, 5 had a well established relationship with the band. The guitarist co-wrote three of the songs for the soundtrack to The Dirt: ""Crash and Burn,” ""Ride With the Devil"" and ""The Dirt (Est. 1981)."" He also shared a writing credit on the 2011 Sixx:A.M. single ""Lies of the Beautiful People.” 5 regularly mixed covers of Motley Crue into his solo performances, including renditions of “Shout at the Devil,” Kickstart My Heart” and “Home Sweet Home.” In 2021, the guitarist joined Nikki Sixx, Zombie and Clufetos in the supergroup L.A. Rats.Now, 5 is poised for the next chapter in his career, becoming just the second guitarist in Motley Crue’s history. In a statement announcing his addition to the group, the rocker was concise but earnest: ""I'm honored to carry on Mick's legacy and am looking forward to playing these songs.”Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete GuideThe complete story of Motley Crue's five lineup changes.";2022-10-27;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-5-rock-history/;2022-10-30;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJOHN5'SROCKCREDENTIALS:FROMDAVIDLEEROTHTOMOTLEYCRUE
Ultimate Classic Rock;Flea to Celebrate How People Fall in Love With Music;Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea announced a15-part podcast in support of his nonprofit music school in February 2023.;Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea announced the launch of a podcast in which he’ll explore how people fall in love with music.Titled This Little Light, the 15-part series begins on March 30 and features guests including Patti Smith, Rick Rubin and others. They’ll talk to Flea about their early influences and experiences, the teachers who encouraged them and how they learned to balance creativity and career interests. The show is produced in association with Parallel and Audacy, and proceeds will benefit the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, the nonprofit music school Flea founded in 2001.“I wanted to do This Little Light to benefit my music school,” Flea said in a statement. “The idea behind it being music education, falling in love with music and embarking on a musical journey for your life. ... Everybody’s path is so different, and it’s fascinating to learn how every musician came to music and developed their study of it over time.”Flea co-founded the school with his friend Keith Barry as a result of “severe cutbacks to arts education programming throughout Los Angeles public schools,” its website explained. “Our primary focus is on the youth of the community, but all are welcome and encouraged to participate. … Our goal is to keep our standard of teaching at the highest level while maintaining a friendly, fun and nurturing environment. The study of music enriches not only the lives of the student and teacher but the community and society as well.”Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Ranked Funk rockers have delivered some timeless classics ... and a couple of forgettable releases, too.;2023-02-23;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/flea-podcast-this-little-light/;2023-02-26;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKFLEATOCELEBRATEHOWPEOPLEFALLINLOVEWITHMUSIC
Ultimate Classic Rock;Early Metallica Collaborator’s 'Hit the Lights' Regret;Lloyd Grant played on band’s first-ever recording, but wishes he could have done it differently.;"Lloyd Grant, the guitarist who played lead guitar on Metallica’s first-ever recording, said he’d have approached it differently if he’d known what it was going to achieve.Drummer Lars Ulrich was still in the process of forming the band, and they didn’t yet have a lead guitarist when they tracked “Hit the Lights” for inclusion in 1982’s Metal Massacre compilation album. Its success began their journey to global acclaim.“Lars was just desperate to find people he could play with,” Grant told Metal Hammer in a recent interview. “We were just two guys both looking for like-minded people, not just someone who could play but someone you’d get along with enough to move in together.”While the pair would meet regularly and had started writing songs together, Ulrich was also working with others. “We would be jamming in Lars’ apartment,” Grant said, “but he was still looking for people to play with and so when I wasn’t there he was finding other people to play with too. … I do remember he brought a guy into the practice once and it was James Hetfield. They’d got a tape and it was an early instrumental version of ‘Hit the Lights,’ but at that point there still wasn’t a name for the band.”Listen to Metallica’s ‘Hit the Lights’ from 1982Grant thought the ""Hit the Lights"" demo was ""right up [his] alley"" when he first heard it, and recalled wishing he’d been one of its writers. While Hetfield and Ulrich had been joined by early bassist Ron McGovney, they still hadn’t recruited Dave Mustaine as lead guitarist. “We weren’t playing any more, but I do remember he still approached me when it was just Lars, James and Ron to go and play with them,” Grant said. “I went over and we went through it a couple times, which was really awesome.“After that I got another call, this time to come and record ‘Hit the Lights’ – put down a guitar solo because they were trying to get the song onto the compilation Metal Massacre. They literally turned a recorder on and just got me doing a solo; if I’d known just how much interest it was going to create I’d have spent way more time on it!”Grant’s ambition of becoming a full-time musician was never realized, partly because he lived alone at the time and needed a job to “keep a roof over my head and keep my car on the road.” He remained in close contact with Ulrich for several years afterwards, and he’s still invited to attend Metallica events, including appearing on stage with the current lineup, Mustaine and McGovney in 2011.Asked how it felt to be part of the band’s legacy, he replied: “It feels super important, my name appearing in the same breath as the story of Metallica. It’s pretty interesting, but obviously at the time we couldn’t predict the future so nobody knew what was going to happen!”Watch Lloyd Grant Guest with Metallica in 2011Metallica Albums Ranked There are moments of indecision when compiling this gallery of Metallica Albums, Ranked Worst to Best.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Steve Jones Didn’t Know What the Word 'Anarchy' Meant;Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones admitted he didn't know what the word 'anarchy' meant when the band released 'Anarchy in the U.K.' during a June 2022 interview.;"Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones admitted he didn’t know what the word ""anarchy"" meant, even when his band recorded their classic 1976 single “Anarchy in the U.K.”“I was pretty illiterate back then. I’m not proud of it, but that’s just the way it was,” Jones recently confessed while appearing on the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast. “And I never listened to lyrics.”Though Jones didn’t comprehend the words delivered by Sex Pistols singer John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), he knew the general message he was trying to convey in “Anarchy in the U.K.”.“I mean, I knew he’s on about something,” Jones noted. “But to me, it was all just great. Whatever it is. The music was what I used to get drawn to. With any bands. Even if it was pop songs. It was the catchiness that drew me in or the chorus. I really didn’t listen to, like, if I were to listen to Bob Dylan songs, I wouldn’t have a clue what he was singing about. It was too intelligent for me.”Lydon - long regarded as a major figure in punk rock’s antiestablishment history - turned heads recently when he said, “Anarchy is a terrible idea. Let’s get that clear. I’m not an anarchist.”The singer also expressed support for Queen Elizabeth, even though another Sex Pistols classic, “God Save the Queen,” was famously anti-royal.When informed of Lydon’s recent comments, Jones said he wasn’t surprised. “We get older, you change. I think it’s all part of life,"" the guitarist explained. ""I mean, I think it’d be silly if you had the same thinking that you did when you was 19, when you’re a kid and you don’t know shit, to when you’re older. Everyone changes.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Live Nation Boss Says Ticketing Trade is an 'Easy Target';Live Nation's Michael Rapino discussed Ticketmaster's need to “build some credibility back” after anger over hidden fees and steep pricing in May 2023.;"Live Nation Entertainment boss Michael Rapino said the ticketing industry was “widely misunderstood” and an “easy target” for those unhappy with pricing issues, but also admitted work was needed to “build some credibility back.”Live Nation’s Ticketmaster division is one of the corporations which many blame for dynamic pricing and hidden “junk fees.” Those activities, among others, are the subject of new legislation being developed by the U.S. government – and Live Nation previously announced its support for that work.“I do think as an industry, we probably do have to absorb a bit better and think a little smarter at what is the add-on fee,” Rapino told the Bob Lefsetz Podcast. “I don’t think it’s justified probably at every ticket price point. At Live Nation, we’ll look at the lower-end ticket prices in the theater and clubs and say, ‘Can we scale them back and make sure [there’s] a defendable fee on a service, on a ticket price?’ It’s been too easy to add a dollar to the service fee.”He said that recent price increases were associated with a 19 percent jump in Live Nation’s show production costs including fuel, staff and staging equipment. He also said around 80 percent of service fees went to venues rather than Ticketmaster itself.Citing the example of the Cure frontman Robert Smith’s fightback against sky-high fees, which saw Ticketmaster paying refunds to fans, Rapino argued: “We did a ton of work with Robert, making sure  were non-transferable, that it would be a face value [ticket] exchange and verified, doing all we could to put all the roadblocks to deliver his ticket prices to the fans.” He said of the loss associated with the refunds: “It was a fast decision, we thought it was worth the million dollars or so to send the right message … It doesn’t matter whether justifying the service fee is a good idea or not – we have an industry where we have to build some credibility back.”But while he accepted that costs should be cleaned out in smaller venues, Rapino asserted that when it came to large-scale shows featuring world-class artists, Live Nation operated in an industry that could “charge a bit more.” “I’m not saying excessively, but it’s a great two-hour performance,"" he explained. ""That happens once every three, four years… You don’t have to underprice yourself.”He added: “This is a great, great product that people will buy, as they’re gonna buy the Gucci bag. They’re gonna buy moments in life where they will step up, and spoil themselves – the big screen TV and or whatever it may be.”Top 100 Classic Rock ArtistsClick through to find out how they stack up, as we count down the Top 100 classic rock artists.";2023-05-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/live-nation-easy-target/;2023-05-07;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKLIVENATIONBOSSSAYSTICKETINGTRADEISAN'EASYTARGET'
Ultimate Classic Rock;Alice Cooper Names Three Bands Every Young Musician Should Hear;"Shock-rock icon says too many hopefuls ""just throw it away.""";"Alice Cooper named the three bands he believes every young musician should listen to so they can take their raw talent and turn it into powerful art.He’s a judge on the No Cover show, where musicians are evaluated on their original songs, rather than being able to sing material written by others.“I’m always saying everything revolves around how good the song is,” Cooper told LA Weekly in a recent interview. “You know, I don’t care how exciting you are up there. … Spend your time listening to the Beatles. I tell young bands all the time: ‘I want you to listen to the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the 4 Seasons. They wrote perfect songs, right? Their records were perfect.”He noted that ""you can be an angry punk rock band, but write a song around it. Don’t just play a riff or a drum part and yell at me. That’s not a song. You have to have a verse and a chorus. That’s why I want you to listen to early Beatles and the Beach Boys. You can be just as angry and have a good song. You don’t have to just throw it away. Too many bands just throw it away.""Cooper shared his enthusiasm for watching young bands onstage, saying, “They remind me of when my band was in high school. We couldn’t be onstage long enough. We wanted to be up there for eight hours. ... And then I’ve just got to say … you’ve got to be a star. If you’re going to be a star, you have to think you’re a star. You can’t just go out there and just be face value, you have to understand that you are a star or the audience will not regard you as one.”He argued that audiences want the lead singer to be “the focal point” of a performance. ""That means don’t ever look away from them,"" he explained. ""You have to stare them down. You have to be you and you are the star up there. You’re bigger than life. So, you know, don’t come up here and be shy. That’s not what a rock singer is.“I tell my band this all the time. When you’re onstage, I want you to reek of ego.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Blackie Lawless: 'Thoughts of Retirement Just Don't Appeal to Me';Blackie Lawless talked to UCR about W.A.S.P.'s 40th-anniversary U.S. tour, new album and more in a July 2022 interview.;"W.A.S.P. played their first shows since 2019 over the past two weekends, performing in Stockholm and Rejmyre, Sweden, as a warm-up for their upcoming 40th-anniversary fall U.S. tour. The Blackie Lawless-fronted quartet will kick off their stateside trek on Oct. 28 in Las Vegas, marking their first show on U.S. soil since 2013 and their first proper tour of the country since 2010. Armored Saint will open for them, and Michael Schenker will provide additional support on select dates.UCR caught up with Lawless in late April to discuss W.A.S.P.'s ""meteoric"" rise to fame, their highly anticipated U.S. tour, the key to career longevity and his thoughts on reintroducing the rude, crude classic ""Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)"" into the band's live set to mark the occasion.How did the decision to embark on this 40th-anniversary trek come about?For any artist, to reach a point where you put an exclamation point on four decades, that's something to be really acknowledged — not just from the artist's perspective, [but] for the fans too. I've always thought the testament of a real career was not if an artist could do it for five years or for 10 years. It was more like, could you do it for 20? Could you do it for 30? And then you start going beyond that, and it's head-scratching time then. It's a testament to the relationship between any artist and their fan base because all artists have to be willing to take that fan base on a lifelong journey. And to do that, you need to effectively crack open your skull and allow that audience to come in and walk around barefooted inside your head. Because if you don't do that, they're never gonna feel intimate with you. And if they don't feel intimate with you, they're never really gonna know who you are. And that's the only real way of communicating with them, to have that connection. And I think that's something that all the artists that have been able to span that period of time or any lengthy period of time, I think that's what we all have in common.If you look at any of the biggest rock acts throughout history, I think they understood from a very early stage that they had to play the long game, and they weren't interested in scoring one or two hits, or being the flavor of the week and then disappearing. They wanted to turn this into a career, and as you just said, I think that takes a completely different mindset than just having your 15 minutes.Yeah, because you know, what is it you have to say? I mean, what makes you different? What makes you so cool that you can actually verbalize something in lyrics? So what is it you're trying to say? Do you have some unique perspective? Because there's a lot of people that can play instruments out there. What sets them apart? What is it that they're saying? When [Pete] Townsend says, ""I hope I die before I get old,"" when you make a statement like that, that's substantial. And it's either going to endear people or it's going to repel them. But you want to stand for something, so what are you saying that everybody's thinking but has never really figured out a way to put into words yet? Is there something that you're really moved about that you can say, that other people are going to identify with? ""I wanna be somebody."" That's a pretty comprehensive statement. I always thought the song was quite honestly mediocre. But I get the sentiment because the sentiment is what moved me in the first place. And I think that's a pretty fair example of what a fan base would latch on to and say, ""That's something I can identify with.""Watch W.A.S.P.'s 'I Wanna Be Somebody' VideoI think it's cool — and I'm sure this is not lost on you — that you guys are coming back and hitting the road in the U.S. now for the first time in a decade as a lot of your contemporaries are starting to call it quits and they're going on their farewell tours. I think that creates even more excitement and urgency among fans to go see this tour.You may be right. I don't think of age as a number. I think it's how you feel, and I still feel like I'm in my 20s. I feel really good, I can do most everything I've ever done, so I feel pretty good about where I'm at. The thoughts of retirement just don't appeal to me. I see some people use it as a marketing tool, and I've always thought that was kind of a cheap stunt. I mean, if they're sincere about it, then you probably do — I shouldn't say probably — you do owe it to a fan base to tell them if you're indeed gonna stop. I mean, my natural reaction, I'm the kind of person that I would want to just do it till I can't do it anymore. And then I'd just stop. You know, one day you just don't go into the office anymore. I don't want a gold watch from anybody for my years of servitude. That's not my thing. But I do think that you would have an obligation to let people know if you were indeed gonna stop. But that's just not my thing. That’s not the way I would go about it. Because what do you do when you retire? You know, we were fortunate enough — and I say we [as in] anybody who does this for a living — you did it because you would've done it for free anyway, so what's there to stop? If you physically cannot do it anymore, I get that. But you've been blessed to make a living at your hobby, this thing that's been your passion. So why do you want to stop? I mean, I don't.Are there any songs in particular — perhaps even some latter-day ones — that you're especially excited to play on this tour?There are, but I'm not gonna name you any right now because we haven't gone into rehearsals yet. And I know from past experience that, you know, you think you might do this or you think you might do that. You get into rehearsal, and some songs will just fall flat on their faces. They sound great on recordings, but they don't translate live, as opposed to any band's first record. They played that record live so many times, they know the reaction it's gonna have on people. But by the time you get to your second record, you don't have that ability anymore to go out and, you know, beta test on audiences that material. Those days are gone. So you have to just kind of go on a wing and a prayer.Watch W.A.S.P.'s 'Wild Child' VideoWhen the tour was announced, you had said that you had started to soften your stance on playing ""Animal"" live. I just wanted to see if you've thought any more about that, if you've made any decision yet as to whether you want to bring that song back into the set list on this tour.Not yet because, again, we've yet to go into rehearsal. The thing we're working on more than anything right now is the actual stage setup, the production. And we put a lot of time into this as to what it's gonna look like. And from what I'm seeing right now, it's gonna look like an old carnival, you know, like a spooky type of carnival, some old sideshow you would've seen. And I don't mean like a state fair. I'm talking about, you know, it's rather on the frightening side, shall we say. But from what I'm seeing so far, we've got a couple of models of it built, and it looks pretty cool. So like I said, first thing's first, we're doing that because once the models are done and the decisions are made, then you have to put that into reality. Then the music starts after that. Plus we're working on a new record right now as we speak anyway, so I've kind of got my hands full.How's the record going? How far along are you in that process?Well, I could tell you it's pretty far, but I've learned in the past that that doesn't necessarily mean anything. … I was convinced where I thought this record was going before we [started], and now I'm not so sure. It doesn't mean that the material is gonna change; it's the way you treat the material. You know, how do you want the mix to sound? There's a number of factors that go into it. So these things, a lot of times, I've learned you've got to get out of the way and let it take its own direction. I mean, you can force anything if you want to, but if you let it go where it wants to go, then that's a big part of the beauty of the discovery process.Can fans expect to see a return of Elvis the microphone stand on this run?He'll be there.Top 30 Glam Metal AlbumsThere's nothing guilty about these pleasures.";2022-08-01;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/blackie-lawless-tour-album-interview/;2022-08-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKBLACKIELAWLESS:'THOUGHTSOFRETIREMENTJUSTDON'TAPPEALTOME'
Ultimate Classic Rock;Joni Mitchell Leaving Spotify ‘In Solidarity With Neil Young’;Joni Mitchell announced that she was removing her songs from Spotify in solidarity with Neil Young in January 2022.;Joni Mitchell is following Neil Young’s lead and pulling her music from Spotify due to the streaming company’s support for controversial podcast The Joe Rogan Experience.“I’ve decided to remove all my music from Spotify,” the acclaimed singer-songwriter explained via a short note on her website. “Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.”Young’s recent battle with Spotify has garnered headlines across the globe. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer decried the streaming platform for allowing programs such as Rogan’s to promote misinformation pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines.“I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” Young wrote while demanding his music be removed from the platform. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.”Spotify responded to Young’s ultimatum by granting his request and removing his catalog of music from their platform.“We want all the world’s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users,” the company said via statement. “With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.”Many fellow musicians have voiced their support for Young on the issue, including Sebastian Bach, Nils Lofgren and David Crosby.Joni Mitchell Albums RankedIndividuality set her apart from other singer-songwriters in the '70s.;2022-01-28;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joni-mitchell-neil-young-spotify/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKJONIMITCHELLLEAVINGSPOTIFY‘INSOLIDARITYWITHNEILYOUNG’

Ultimate Classic Rock;Music Industry Is 'Criminal Enterprise' Says Jay Jay French;Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French compared drug dealing with the business of being in a band in January 2022.;"Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French called the music industry a “criminal enterprise” and compared it directly to dealing drugs.French, who also managed the band, said he wouldn’t argue against the suggestion that dealers know more about transacting business than people who teach the process in college.“I survived the multiple ODs, I survived the multiple of almost murders,” he told interviewer Dean Cramer in a recent chat. “I will take a street-person knowledge over any academic any day of the week in business, because you learn how to do a deal with people in business. … By the way, rock ’n’ roll, let me be clear, is a criminal enterprise. The record labels are criminals. It’s simple is that. They are just legal criminals.“So, when you're in the cesspool of criminality, whether it's obvious criminality … whether it's blue-collar criminality, where someone is threatening your life with a gun, or it's white-collar criminality, you're dealing with criminals. You're dealing with sleaze, the lowlifes, the lying. You don't believe any of this shit because everyone lies. You kind to have to get use to it.”You can watch the interview below.Last year, French’s bandmate Dee Snider said they didn't receive any royalties for their work until 1998, and even then the payments were a “joke.”“In order to get the band to reunite , the record label wiped our debt out,"" he explained. ""That was 1997.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Rush’s Alex Lifeson Reveals Weird Pre-Show Jams with Primus;Alex Lifeson said Rush and Primus once used instruments they couldn’t play for light-hearted jam sessions during a June 2022 interview.;Rush and Primus cemented friendships while touring together in 1992 that have never failed them.They bonded over a mutual appreciation of artistic approaches, and Rush’s Alex Lifeson says Primus also added an element of humor to the experience.“We would do sound check at 4:30, and then Primus would set up and they’d do their sound check,” he tells Guitar World. “We’d have dinner at 6, and then we would have a jam, usually in our dressing room or in a hallway that was nice and echoey. “At one point, the deal was that you had to go out and get an instrument you couldn’t play,” Lifeson added. “I got an accordion and a flute. We all played these instruments we had no idea how to play. We actually recorded these jams. I don’t know what happened to those recordings, but we did them everywhere.”Primus guitarist Larry LaLonde, who bought a clarinet, said “it sounded like somebody asked, ‘What would it sound like if someone had just bought an accordion that day?’ That’s the kind of music it was.” He also remembered seeing Lifeson “using a tortilla chip for a guitar pick one time,” calling the experience “pretty sweet.”For Primus frontman Les Claypool, “one of the greatest things I ever experienced was during one of those jams in a sports-arena locker room and watching Neil [Peart] play the lockers as his percussive instrument. It was amazing.”Rush Albums RankedWe examine Rush's 19 studio albums, from 1974's muscular self-titled release to a series of remarkable late-career triumphs.The Rush / Metallica Team-Up That Slipped AwayNext: The Most Overlooked Song From Every Rush Album;2022-06-17;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rushs-alex-lifeson-reveals-weird-pre-show-jams-with-primus/;2022-06-19;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKRUSH’SALEXLIFESONREVEALSWEIRDPRE-SHOWJAMSWITHPRIMUS
Ultimate Classic Rock;How George Harrison Foiled One of Slash’s Musical Ambitions;Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash saidin March 2022 that he couldn't get away with using the sitar because it immediately sounded like George Harrison.;"Slash lamented that he couldn’t get away with using more sitar in his music — because it immediately sounded like the Beatles.George Harrison popularized the Indian instrument in the West after playing it on a number of Beatles tracks, and his studies with master performer Ravi Shankar drew even more attention among Western artists.Slash used a sitar in the track “Spirit Love” on recent solo album 4 — but in a new Music Radar interview, the Guns N’ Roses guitarist admitted it was hard to avoid the Harrison comparison. “I laughed because, when you said George Harrison, that was the one thing I was trying for it not to sound like!” he told interviewer Jonathan Horsley. “It’s true, though! That’s what happens whenever you record sitar; it just becomes that cliche.”He continued: “I think I got away with it this time. There are other times where it has come up. I have a real double-gourded sitar that I got from India but I can never use it because any time I have ever even attempted to record with it it just sounds so Ravi Shankar.” Slash hoped his approach made the instrument sound different enough. “I recorded the sitar through my Marshall, the same setting as my guitar, so it sounds like a sitar but it also sounds like a fucking monstrous sitar or something,” he explained.Listen to Slash’s ‘Spirit Love’Elsewhere in the interview, Slash argued that studio technology was pushing the recording process too far away from the spirit of rock ’n’ roll. “The human dynamic of people working in the moment, and especially working as an ensemble, there is a lot of little things that go on,” he said. “There is a lot of communication […] that really comes across in the playing and the way it sounds, and what we have got into the habit of doing is just producing everything to the point where there is nothing organic about it.”He allowed that the tech-heavy approach worked for some genres of music, but not rock. “I mean, the advent of the hard drive made people go crazy, and people were making records from all corners of the Earth […] We were all sending them in; ‘Isn’t this great!?’ And that was the novelty of it, and I think it has worn off and we are starting to realize that the integrity of the music is totally lost in this fascination with the ability to do that.“I think for rock ’n’ roll, all of the greatest rock records, for the most part, are done pretty much in a live setting, or in a very stripped-down, raw setting where everybody is playing more or less together, and I think that is something that comes across in what you’re hearing. You can’t put your finger on it. It’s there, and it’s something that makes records exciting. Being in a rock ’n’ roll band is to be able to go in and be as good as any of those people that didn’t have the luxuries of what we have today, where they only had three takes and they were out!”Guns N' Roses Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide (We Think)Few bands have impacted rock 'n' roll the way they have, and even fewer have weathered as many changes.";2022-03-20;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/slash-george-harrison-sitar/;2022-03-20;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWGEORGEHARRISONFOILEDONEOFSLASH’SMUSICALAMBITIONS
Ultimate Classic Rock;Roger Daltrey Admits the Who Were 'Too F----ing Loud';Roger Daltrey said the Who were too f---ing loud in their heyday and his heading aids are a penalty in April 2022.;"Roger Daltrey admitted the Who were “too fucking loud” in their heyday and said his hearing problems are a “penalty” for his band’s behavior.The group was once listed as the loudest band in the world, being registered at delivering 136db of sound at an open-air show in 1976. While others have staked the same claim over the years, the Guinness World Records organization no longer records the feat since it’s connected with permanent ear damage.In a recent interview with the Independent, Daltrey said his upcoming solo shows would involve a Q&A section, but that the questions would probably be taken in advance. Asked how his hearing was, he responded, “Terrible, terrible. Without these things"" - indicating his in-ear aids - ""everything’s a mumble. It’s a penalty for what we did in our lives. We were too fucking loud.""Looking back, he also expressed regret that the Who were so well-known for smashing their equipment – notably guitarist Pete Townshend. “When he broke that first guitar, it actually broke my heart,” he said of the first incident in 1964. “What I would have given for that guitar when I was three years younger than we were then. … We became more famous for the breaking of the guitars than anything else. It became a monkey on our back and extremely expensive.”Things were so bad, Daltrey said, that the Who were constantly in debt despite already being a world-class act. “We didn’t make any money at all until 1972,” he noted, adding that he never enjoyed the level of fame the band achieved. “I mix with ordinary people,” he said. “I don’t have bodyguards, I go on public transport. That stardom thing, that celebrity thing – I didn’t like it. I had it for five or six years there, and I was uncomfortable with it. I’d much rather be down home with ordinary people. I’m much happier with that.”The Who are currently touring North America.2022 Classic Rock Tour and Festival PreviewMore and more artists are returning to the stage.";2022-04-25;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/roger-daltrey-the-who-too-loud/;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKROGERDALTREYADMITSTHEWHOWERE'TOOF----INGLOUD'
Ultimate Classic Rock;How Kenny Loggins Became the Soundtrack King;Kenny Loggins tells UCR during a June 2022 interview the secrets behind his soundtrack success and what it was like revisiting 'Danger Zone.';"It's no surprise that because of the soundtrack success Kenny Loggins enjoyed in the '80s and beyond, he ended up with an entire chapter of his new memoir devoted to the subject. You know about Caddyshack, Footloose and Top Gun. But there are also some layers of Loggins' cinematic adventures that aren't as well known, like American Gigolo, Flashdance, A Star is Born.A film buff since he was a kid, the singer-songwriter weaves together a lot of fascinating history regarding his movie work in the pages of Still Alright, his new memoir that arrives June 14. During a Zoom conversation with UCR, he delved into some additional topics related to the songs.You're having a fresh moment with ""Danger Zone,"" which is great timing for your book. The way the pandemic kept pushing the Top Gun: Maverick release further and further lines up nicely.That’s right in alignment with everything in the book, where I just happened to be down the street and they need a singer for “Danger Zone” and shit like that. It’s like the god of money is sitting beside me. [Laughs] What can we do now?What do you remember feeling after the original version was recorded?I was really happy with how it came out. I mention in the book that I was very into Tina Turner at the time and the way she pronounced things. Her gospel and R&B history, combining with her love of Rod Stewart and the modern rock and roll at the time created a level of intense R&B rock and roll. I mean, name three other acts that do it anywhere near as intensely as she did it. That’s what I was trying to bring to “Danger Zone.” When I listen to it now, I hear myself go, “DAYN-ger ZOH-ahn,” in that total Tina accent. I think it’s funny, but it works in that song. It’s a character for the song.Watch the Video for 'Danger Zone' by Kenny LogginsYou recorded a new version of ""Danger Zone."" What did you rediscover about the song as a result of that?One of the things that the original song felt like to me, it was like a big mono [recording]. I really wanted to re-record the song to capture that 5.0 surround thing that theaters are doing. I wanted to use that huge theater sound system in the mix itself. I didn’t get to, because Tom [Cruise] was so in love with the original version. He really wanted to use that as the marker for bringing the audience fully focused back to that original vibe. It really works, I mean, the way he did it, putting it in the opening of the scene. So if there’s a third Top Gun someday, it will probably be in the opening of that movie. They’re all going to want to hearken back to the original.But what I learned from the original, I learned that my voice was higher 36 years ago or whatever it is. It was a harder song to sing now in the original key and in the original way. We took the original vocal and put it on two tracks. I sent that to my left ear and I sent my voice now to my right ear. I [tried] to emulate myself until I found exactly where in my throat I was singing from, so I could come as close to that voice as possible. I think it’s pretty good. I had to use like five guitars to get that vibe that the original had with only one guitar.Giorgio Moroder had the bulk of the original ""Danger Zone"" completed when you came in to sing it. Did you take any creative license with this new version?Yes. When I was working with [producer] Tom Whitlock and he showed me what they had, I felt like I just wanted to bring more of a Police vibe to it, chordally. So I added a lot of two chords, open voicing things, where they just had like 1-4-5. I added all of the inversions and then we extended the bridge out.How much were you inspired by the Police back in the day?They brought a musicality to that kind of rock and roll. They weren’t anywhere [like the later] grunge thing. They weren’t the Foo Fighters. They had a very clean, but aggressive rock thing where they could cluster chords together and you would hear more notes than just ones and fives. That’s what I wanted to bring to [the new version of] “Danger Zone.”I loved the anecdote that you never saw the second Caddyshack movie. How easy was it by that point to write a soundtrack song? Was ""Nobody's Fool"" an easy, formulaic Loggins soundtrack song to turn out from your perspective?No, I knew that I wanted [something different]. When Jon Peters asked me to write the theme for the second one, I didn’t want to do a parody of “I’m Alright.” I didn’t want to do an imitation of that. I decided I would try to write a rock song in the modality of pop/rock songs at that time. So it’s very much influenced by Foreigner, you know that high vocal [Loggins sings the section] “I’m going all the way,” it's very ‘80s soprano rock singer guy. I hate the fact that it’s that high now. [Laughs] Because it’s so difficult to reproduce. But I can do it. I’ve been working on it. It’s challenging. But the song was not formulaic for me, because it was way out of my wheelhouse. I wasn’t used to writing in that style. But once I got the right players in the room, it was really fun to put together.Watch the Video for 'Nobody's Fool' by Kenny LogginsYou certainly had a knack already for recording a good pop single. How much do you think working on soundtrack songs helped you to further hone that skill? What did you take away from the experience?It really gave me the freedom to mess with genres. I had the beginning of “I’m Alright” in my hands and I remember showing it to Tris [Imboden], my drummer and he was like, “Oh, that sounds okay.” It was not like, “Oh my God, that’s a hit, you’d better finish it.” Because it’s really, the chorus is one chord. It’s D7 to D, to D7 to D. It’s like, how did I get away with that? I remember thinking that “Footloose” was way out of my normal vibe. It was not what I would have written for Kenny Loggins. The movies gave me freedom to be somebody else. In that freedom, I could write in whatever genre I felt was appropriate for the movie. So in a way, I loved and I miss that kind of freedom in my own writing. I think I’ve tried to bring it into what I do since then. Part of the fun of being a collaborator is that I can now let go of whoever I think I’m supposed to be and move into the vibe of my collaboration. I become an extension of the person I’m working with.I talked to someone once who was handed a song title to write a song for a soundtrack. That's a great challenge.Right? And to me, you see, too often they want something spot on. They want something that’s too literal to the movie. I liked to go [against the grain]. American Gigolo, originally I was going to have a part in that process because John Travolta was the original guy they wanted for it. The original scene was a tender love scene between a male prostitute and an older woman. The scene was not a sweet love song, even though visually, they were filming it that way. I wanted to go crossgrain and I wrote a thing called “Love Has Come of Age,” which in my mind, was a sort of bump and grind, Stevie Wonder type of thing. The song came out really good, but they totally changed their minds and didn’t even want to hear anything. But I like the idea of the sort of oil and water vibe where you go crossgrain and you don’t write a literal song to the scene. You try to extend the scene out in some other way. That’s part of the challenge of writing music for movies.Watch the Video for 'Footloose' by Kenny LogginsThe Best Rock Movie From Every YearA look at the greatest biopics, documentaries, concert films and movies with awesome soundtracks.";2022-06-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kenny-loggins-interview-danger-zone-2022/;2022-06-05;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWKENNYLOGGINSBECAMETHESOUNDTRACKKING

No cause of death was given.Shorter's career included collaborations with the likes of Steely Dan, Carlos Santana, Joni Mitchell, Don Henley and Herbie Hancock, among others.Born in Newark, N.J., in 1933, Shorter graduated from New York University in 1956 with a degree in music education. He spent two years in the U.S. Army before joining Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1959. In 1964, he joined Miles Davis' second great quintet, appearing on influential early jazz fusion albums like In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew. He also enjoyed a fruitful solo career around this time, recording albums for Blue Note Records.In 1970, Shorter co-founded the jazz fusion group Weather Report, which released more than a dozen albums, many of which were co-produced by Shorter.Listen to Weather Report's 'Tears'In 1977, Shorter performed the solo on the title track of Steely Dan's Grammy-winning album Aja. That same year, he contributed to Joni Mitchell's Don Juan's Reckless Daughter; Shorter would go on to play on nine more Mitchell albums, up until 2002.""I would give her the entrances and exits and all that stuff. She said, 'Wow!'"" Shorter told CBS Music [via jonimitchell.com] in 2013. ""And then she would have a number of takes and she would choose from different takes to edit in as if using a paintbrush again because, of course, every take was different. She said she wished she could use all of them, but she would highlight the ones that would become the record with what she thought was a large, big, fat, rainbow of a palette that she could use.""In 1988, Shorter toured with Carlos Santana, who contributed guitar to the 1986 Weather Report album, This Is This! In 1989, Shorter played the sax solo on Don Henley's Top 10 hit ""The End of the Innocence.""Listen to Wayne Shorter Play on Joni Mitchell's 'Jericho'In 2015, Santana stated that he planned to create a supergroup called Supernova with Shorter, Hancock and guitarist John McLaughlin.

""That's one reason I quit playing arenas and playing outdoors. It wasn't about music — it was about being a human jukebox."" The comment falls in line with an incident that took place at Mellencamp's concert in Cleveland in May, where he warned the audience that if it didn't ""shut the fuck up,"" he would cut the show short. ""Look, guys, if I wanted to play in this type of drunken environment, I'd play outside or I'd play in an arena,"" he said from the stage.Still, the passing decades have given Mellencamp a different perspective on some of his hits, like ""Hurts So Good,"" which was released in 1982. ""I quit playing it 25 years ago,"" he said. ""But I've been playing it on this tour, and it has a whole new meaning to me. 'When I was a young boy, I said, ""Put away those young boy ways.""' I was a kid when I wrote it, but as an older gentleman, it makes sense.""Watch John Mellencamp Perform 'Hurts So Good' in 2023Mellencamp also spoke about his raucous reputation from back in the day. ""I punched the blond-haired singer of the Cars,"" he said, presumably referring to the late Benjamin Orr. ""I fought all the time and lost all the time."" This included live settings, where Mellencamp was booted from tours with Rainbow, REO Speedwagon and Kiss.""I got kicked off every tour I was on,"" he said. ""My band and I were terrible, but we were better than Kiss. I was a young kid, full of energy, and the reviews said, 'John Cougar blew the place up last night.'

Ultimate Classic Rock;Watch Guns N' Roses' New Live 1991 Video for 'You Could Be Mine';Guns N' Roses released a new live 1991 video for the 'Use Your Illusion II' song 'You Could Me Mine' in October 2022.;"Guns N’ Roses have released a new music video for “You Could Be Mine,” recorded live during the band’s May 16, 1991, performance at the Ritz Theatre in New York. You can watch it below.The video is loaded with quick cuts from throughout the concert, as evidenced by the band's several outfit changes (particularly Axl Rose, who variously sports a cowboy hat and fishnet shirt and American flag tights). Slash introduces the song during then-new drummer Matt Sorum's opening fill. The video also contains several clips of co-founding Guns guitarist Izzy Stradlin, who quit the band in November 1991 amid the massive Use Your Illusion Tour.Notably, the video ends before Rose reveals that he broke his foot jumping off a speaker. ""Have you ever heard the expression 'break a leg'?"" he asked the crowd after the song. ""Well, I think I just did.""“You Could Be Mine” was originally released in June 1991 as the first single from the Use Your Illusion albums. The song was used in the blockbuster action film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. As the legend goes, star Arnold Schwarzenegger was so determined to have GNR's involvement in the film, he invited the band to dinner and negotiated a deal for the song.The new video arrives in advance of Guns N’ Roses’ mammoth Use Your Illusion I & II box set, due Nov. 11. The collection features a total of 97 tracks, 63 of which are previously unreleased. The complete audio from the 1991 performance at the Ritz will be included as part of the set. A second classic live performance, recorded in Las Vegas at Thomas & Mack Center on Jan. 25, 1992, will also be included. Those opting for one of the “super deluxe” versions of the box set will also receive a Blu-ray video of the complete Live In New York concert film.The collection will also notably feature a new version of the classic hit ""November Rain,"" with a 50-piece orchestra replacing the sampled sounds used on the original.The 30 Wildest Moments From Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion TourFrom Rock in Rio to the Riverport riot, here are the 30 wildest moments from Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion Tour.";2022-10-06;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/guns-n-roses-you-could-be-mine-live-1991-video/;2022-10-09;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWATCHGUNSN'ROSES'NEWLIVE1991VIDEOFOR'YOUCOULDBEMINE'
Ultimate Classic Rock;Alice Cooper Said 'No Overdubs' on New Album With Touring Band;Alice Cooper talks to UCR about his new album, new stage show and the 50th anniversary of 'Billion Dollar Babies' in March 2023.;"Getting to the top is easy. Staying there is the real challenge. Just ask Alice Cooper.The Godfather of Shock Rock has enjoyed dizzying highs and weathered perilous lows over a career spanning more than half a century, and he's got plenty of scars and stories to show for it. Cooper could have easily become a rock 'n' roll casualty; instead, he kicked his vices and became a sage survivor, a picture of self-preservation on a constant quest for reinvention.This year is no different, as Cooper readies an all-new stage show called ""Too Close for Comfort,"" which he'll debut in April on a solo headlining tour before opening for Motley Crue and Def Leppard and co-headlining alongside Rob Zombie this summer. Rejoining him onstage will be guitarist Nita Strauss, who left the band in 2022 to hit the road with Demi Lovato and was replaced temporarily by former Cooper guitarist Kane Roberts.Cooper indicates that fans will be hearing a lot more of Strauss and the rest of his touring band in a recent talk with UCR, during which he discusses his new stage show, recording plans and the 50th anniversary of the chart-topping Billion Dollar Babies.Over the past few years, you've been bringing a handful of late-'80s cuts from Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell back into your set. Fans were super-excited when you guys brought ""Freedom"" back on the last tour with Kane.Kane, of course, is one of my favorite people in the world. He's got Stallone's body and Jerry Lewis' brain. He's one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life. But, you know, those '80s songs we brought back in because we had Nita. Nita was a shredder, and those songs were all Kane Roberts shred songs. And so when she came in the band, I went, ""Oh, that opens up a couple of albums here."" That opens up Raise Your Fist and Yell and Constrictor and all those songs where that kind of guitar can kind of rule. Ryan [Roxie] and Tommy [Henriksen] are just great rock 'n' roll guitar players. They're sort of Joe Perry-type of guitar players. But getting that extra boost of having a shredder like that, that opened up a lot for us.Who initiated the conversation for Nita Strauss to come back?It was the funniest thing because I always have had a revolving door in my band. If somebody has a thing where they say, ""I want to go do this for six months,"" I go, ""OK, go."" Absolutely no problem. ... I understood what she was trying to do with Demi, and it worked. It was a good thing. And of course, getting Kane back in was a fan favorite. That was something that was really fun for us and them. And then at the end of it, I said, ""You want to come back?"" She goes, ""Sure."" And I went, ""OK, great. It's gonna be a whole new show."" I never, ever take a musician and put them in a position where they can't revolve out and then revolve back in.Watch Alice Cooper Live at Graspop Metal Meeting 2022Speaking of the new stage show, is there anything that you're able to share about the upcoming production or set list?I can tell you that Mademoiselle Guillotine is not there anymore. Marie Antoideath is there. Marie Antoideath will probably be the one that is trying so hard to cut my head off because she had her head cut off and she wants revenge.Understandable. I can't blame her for that.No. And we are bringing back one other bit from Welcome to My Nightmare that kind of works right into that, that I think the audience will really, really like. Something we did on Nightmare that really, the audience every night went, ""Oh!"" Those are the kinds of things, it's kind of cool to not just do a song that they weren't expecting, but to do a bit that they're not expecting.Do you think there's a world in which we could ever see some Flush the Fashion or Zipper Catches Skin songs coming back into the mix?The band are always pushing for that. 'Cause some of those songs were my blackout albums, where I honestly don't remember writing Zipper Catches Skin. I don't remember writing much of Special Forces. ... The songs are great, but the production on those songs, I want to go back and almost reproduce those songs. Because the songs were good, it's just that we didn't really produce it well enough. Songs like ""Zorro's Ascent,"" I mean, there's just so many good ones in there that I wish I could just go back and re-record.That would be a real treat for fans.It would be something different. Call it The Blackout Album. In fact, that just happened just now between me and you, so if that happens, you'll know that that came from this conversation.I think those are fascinating records. The circumstances of their creation were not great, but it was really interesting to hear the way you were reacting and adapting to the sound of popular music changing at the time.I didn't know if we were making fun of it or not. Some of it was so tongue-in-cheek, especially on Flush the Fashion, where I kind of think in the back of my mind that I was making fun of it. But at the same time, the songs, like ""Clones"" and ""Leather Boots"" and songs like that, I went, ""Wow, those songs were really pretty cool.""Watch Alice Cooper's 'Clones' VideoYou could apply that line of thinking to a lot of Alice Cooper's discography. You were always kind of satirizing the culture but also engaging with it.When we first played our stuff for Frank Zappa, Frank Zappa listened to it, and it was very ... Pretties for You was very complicated. [The songs] were only two minutes long, but [there were] 38 changes in a song. And he'd sit there and he goes, ""I don't get it."" I went, ""What?"" And he goes, ""I'm Frank Zappa and I don't get it."" And I said, ""Is that good or bad?"" And he says, ""No, I'm signing you because I don't get it."" Now, people listened to that album at the time, and they went ... OK, one guy reviewed it as ""a tragic waste of plastic,"" which I thought was a great review. But now it's being reviewed as art. People are looking at and saying, ""This was so far ahead of its time."" And some of it was.This is a big milestone anniversary year for Alice Cooper. You're looking at the 50th anniversary of Billion Dollar Babies and Muscle of Love. Eight months is not a lot of time between records. Do you have any new revelations about them?Back then, it was something really interesting. If you remember the time period, you did two albums a year. We did Love it to Death and Killer in the same year. And I think we did School's Out and Billion Dollar Babies in the same year. But we did two albums a year. Everybody did, that was just the way it was. You did an album and then you went on tour. And then, while you were on tour, you were writing the next album. And there was a point where the Alice Cooper Band, we did, I think, four or five or six albums in three years or something like that, and they were all hit albums. But while we were on the road, we didn't live anywhere. People would say, ""Well, I want to send this to you. Where do you live?"" And I'd go, ""Uh, Holiday Inn?"" Because we didn't really have an address. It was just, you finished the record and you went on the road. And then when you got off the road, you went right back into the studio, because you were competing with some of the best acts in the world. So you'd better stay up there, especially if you had a hit record. Then the hard part is staying there. If you have a No. 1 record, then people are really waiting for that sophomore record, and it better be good, because that's what's gonna mean if you're gonna stick around.Listen to Alice Cooper's 'Billion Dollar Babies'As you get more successful, even if you're keeping the same pace of writing and recording, I'm sure the touring is amping up, the press is amping up and everything else is becoming a little harder. So it's not realistic to expect to keep that same pace and quality when you're making records.Yeah, and really, you go into an album — especially with [producer] Bob Ezrin — with, ""We don't do fillers."" In other words, every song had to be a song that you could sit down at the piano and sing the verse, the bridge, the chorus. It couldn't just be a riff and somebody yelling at you. The quality of the songs was what really [mattered]. But that was a whole generation. There's not one bad song on Elton [John] albums. There's not one bad song on a Rod Stewart album. The quality of the albums back then was so good. And it's because we were really competitive with each other, and we were the next generation after the Beatles. So who did we learn from? We learned from the Beatles. We learned how to write songs listening to the best band that ever wrote songs. And then you add a little Rolling Stones or a little Yardbirds or a little Kinks into that, and finally, you develop your own sound. But we learned from the best, and I think if you listen to any album from the '70s and '60s, they're all really good songs.You mentioned a few months ago that you and the guys from the original Alice Cooper Band had been working together and whipped up about a dozen songs. Any word on new music, either solo or with your old bandmates?Well, there's a new album coming out with my touring band right now. I wanted to show off the touring band, so we wrote songs, went in the studio, and I said, ""Here's the deal on this album: No overdubs."" I said, ""Everything has to be done in the studio live because the whole idea of this album is showing off how good this band is live."" So when you hear this album, it sounds like a studio album, but it's actually them playing live in the studio. That album will be coming out, and then, the thing with the original band is when we broke up, we never broke up with any bad blood. We went to high school together, we were on the cross country and track team together, things like that. There was never bad blood between any of us, and we always ... I mean, I would ask Dennis [Dunaway], ""Dennis, could you come in and play bass on this song?"" ""Yeah. Could you sing on this song? I've got a thing going on with this band that I'm in."" ""OK."" So there was never that like, ""Oh, I'm never gonna talk to him again,"" or ""I'm never gonna work with him again."" So we've always been writing. ""Neal Smith will send me three or four songs and I'll do some writing lyrics on it and send it back to him, and he has his own band. Dennis is in two or three bands. Mike [Michael Bruce], they're always working musicians. So when we write 10 or 12 songs, I don't know exactly what that's going to be, but I know that those songs exist now. So I'm thinking about in the future, that would be kind of a cool thing.I'm sure your group chemistry and proficiency as individual players have only gotten better over the years.That has a lot to do with Ezrin. Bob Ezrin really forced us into becoming a really good band. The band could play, but he was the guy that came in and said, ""OK, this part is great. This part is great. I don't understand where you're going on this part because it doesn't fit at all."" And then Love it to Death was born, and that was the first time you could listen to an Alice Cooper album and go, ""Oh, that's Alice Cooper."" Because he gave us a signature. When he started out with us, he said, ""Why is it that when you hear a Doors song, you know it's the doors?"" He said, ""Because Jim Morrison's got a signature voice. Robby Krieger, nobody plays like him. Ray Manzarek, they have a sound. The Stones have a sound. You guys don't have a signature sound or something that's really you."" And then, when we worked on Love it to Death, then Alice Cooper had a personality and had a signature sound. And then after that, it just stayed there. If something came on the radio, you could go, ""Oh, that's Alice Cooper.""Alice Cooper Albums RankedYou can't kill Alice Cooper.";2023-03-16;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-interview-2023/;2023-03-17;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKALICECOOPERSAID'NOOVERDUBS'ONNEWALBUMWITHTOURINGBAND
Ultimate Classic Rock;Susanna Hoffs, 'The Deep End': Album Review;A review of Susanna Hoffs' 2023 album, 'The Deep End.';"Susanna Hoffs has created plenty of original music, most notably with the Bangles. But she's no stranger to covers either. Some might remember a version of the Lightning Seeds' ""All I Want"" from her second solo album, or Hoffs taking on Oingo Boingo's ""We Close Our Eyes"" or Dusty Springfield's ""The Look of Love"" for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, respectively. And thenthere was her Under the Covers series with Matthew Sweet, three decade-specific volumes of songs from the '60s, '70s and '80s under the monikers Sid 'n Susie.She's back under the covers for The Deep End, a 13-song set that spans the decades and serves as a companion of sorts to her debut novel, This Bird Has Flown, which is already earmarked for a movie adaptation. This latest trip into others' songs is yet another delight, a demonstration of good taste and guts with Hoffs sounding as beguiling as she did lighting ""Eternal Flame"" or having a ""Manic Monday"" more than 30 years ago.Her range is particularly impressive on The Deep End, running from Moody Blues and Wings co-founder Denny Laine's 1967 solo single ""If You've Got a Problem"" to the title track, which Holly Humberstone released in 2022. Along the way, Hoffs and a talented crew of helpers - legendary producer Peter Asher, for starters, plus members of Elvis Costello's Imposters, Ledisi, Albert Lee and session vets Waddy Wachtel, Leland Sklar, Russell Kunkel and Dan Dugmore - opens its arms wide, from Leslie Gore and the Rolling Stones to Ed Sheeran to Billie Eilish and even a little bit of pedal steel-flavored country via Brandy Clark's ""Pawn Shop."" It's anything but disparate, however; Asher and Hoffs craft cohesion by keeping plenty of sonic space around her vocals while at the same time enveloping that ambience with strings and unfussy arrangements that let the material breathe not unlike a pop diva record circa 1966.There's a lushness that's implied but still plenty of room for these treatments to breathe.Hoffs plants her flag in the ground from the get-go, turning the Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" into a Motown-flavored pop epic whose strings and vibraphone create a shimmer that counters the tune's dark put down. You can't help but smile hearing Hoffs singing about ""a squirming dog who's just had his day,"" making the insult seem all the more wicked with her sweet, pristine tones. And The Deep End goes from there. Hoffs handles the soulful, quasi-Bacharach-David rendition of Joy Oladokun's ""If You've Got a Problem"" as convincingly as she does the torchy grandeur of Leslie Gore's ""You Don't Own Me."" And she knows how to tuck into a meaty melody when she finds it, best demonstrated on Phantom Planet's ""Time Moves On,"" Coconut Records' ""West Coast,"" Dodie's ""Would You Be So Kind"" and ""Say You Don't Mind.""The slightly fuller rendition of Sheeran's ""Afterglow"" is a testament to his inherent songcraft as well as Hoffs' interpretive skills, and she stays largely faithful, melodically, to Squeeze's ""Black Coffee in Bed"" within the arrangement's lighter and more spacious tone. And Yazoo's ""Only You"" neatly straddles a line between organic and synthetic to bring The Deep End to a close. All of this, mind you, is tucked into a very listenable 47 minutes, referencing an old-school pop album that happens to be filled with proven material and buoyed by a singer who's unafraid to tackle all of it.22 Rock Albums We Might (or Might Not) Get in 2023";2023-04-05;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/susanna-hoffs-the-deep-end-album-review/;2023-04-05;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKSUSANNAHOFFS,'THEDEEPEND':ALBUMREVIEW
Ultimate Classic Rock;Rock Hall Boss Calls 2023 Nomination List Exciting and Fun;Rock & Roll Hall of Fame boss Greg Harris discussed the nominees named in February 2023.;"Rock & Roll Hall of Fame CEO Greg Harris said the nomination list for the class of 2023 was “exciting” and “fun,” and looked forward to the chance of putting an Iron Maiden inflatable on display in the museum.Sheryl Crow, Missy Elliott, Joy Division/New Order, Cyndi Lauper, George Michael, Willie Nelson, the White Stripes and Warren Zevon were named as nominees for the first time this year, while Maiden, Kate Bush, Rage Against the Machine, Soundgarden, the Spinners and A Tribe Called Quest had previously been shortlisted but not inducted.""We have a Pink Floyd wall with the inflatable, so heck yeah – we can put one of those babies in here,” Harris said on a new episode of Audacy when asked about a Maiden display. “It would be exciting. It’s fun to think that … you know, we talked about Warren Zevon, [a] piano playing, songwriting guy, and then the triple guitar assault of Iron Maiden in the same class. It’s really exciting and really fun now. ... Maiden was nominated once before, but we’re hopeful that after the success that Judas Priest had last year that Maiden is inducted as well. … We’re thrilled that they're on the ballot.”He said 2023 was “a fantastic year. ... This class of 14 … is huge. Eight of them, it’s their first time ever nominated and a few of them are back for a second, third or fourth, maybe even a fifth, nomination. … It’s just a great group. It underscores the diversity of what we think of as rock ’n’ roll -- and really it’s not just one sound, it’s many sounds – it’s an attitude and a spirit.”Harris singled out Zevon for comment, saying, “He left us an amazing body of work, and was admired by all of his peers. So many folks wanted to play on his records, be part of his songs, and record his songs ... there’s sometimes a surprise that he's not already in.” He also pointed out that Bush had previously been nominated in 2018, before her Stranger Things resurgence. “So the nominating committee recognized her artistry and her impact, and now the whole world is hearing about it. ... Hopefully this puts her over the top.”He noted the number of artists on the list who produced their material, noting that Crow “knows what sound she wants to get and then she finds a way to get it. George Michael, I believe, was his own producer for [much] of his stuff. Of course, Jack White always controls his voice and does it well. I could go down the list ... Kate Bush is the same way.”137 Artists Not in the Rock and Roll Hall of FameMany have shared their thoughts on possible induction.";2023-02-03;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rock-hall-of-fame-greg-harris-2023-class/;2023-02-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKROCKHALLBOSSCALLS2023NOMINATIONLISTEXCITINGANDFUN

Ultimate Classic Rock;Could Marvin Gaye Help Save a Species of Monkeys?;Marvin Gaye's music was used to persuade endangered Barbary macaques to mate in February 2022.;The music of Marvin Gaye has been used in a bid to persuade an endangered species of monkeys to mate.Trentham Monkey Forest in England hired a Gaye impersonator to perform a set of songs for a colony of 140 Barbary macaques – and although it was a publicity stunt, there was evidence that it may have worked.“As every new addition is so important for the protection of the species, special guest Dave Largie was invited into our beloved forest to serenade the primates … to help inspire them to ‘Get It On,’” a statement explained. “David, a highly experienced love-song guru, sang several Marvin Gaye classics to the monkeys whilst in amongst them, and they seemed very relaxed and full of love! Some classic Barbary macaque ‘lovey-dovey’ behavior was on display during the performance such as grooming and teeth chattering. Who knows? Maybe there’s something in it, and the park will have a record number of babies come the summer!”Director Matt Lovatt said: “We thought it could be a creative way to encourage our females to show a little affection to males that might not have been so lucky in love. Females in season mate with several males so paternity amongst our furry residents is never known. Each birth is vital to the species with Barbary macaques being classed as endangered.”Gaye – who died in 1984– was one of the first R&B artists to deal with ecological issues in his 1971 single “Mercy Mercy Me.” Explaining his move away from romantic songs, he once said, “I began to reevaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my music to say. I realized that I had to put my own fantasies behind me if I wanted to write songs that would reach the souls of people. I wanted them to take a look at what was happening in the world.”Top 25 Soul Albums of the '70sThere's more to the decade than Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, but those legends are well represented.;2022-02-10;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/marvin-gaye-sings-for-monkeys/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKCOULDMARVINGAYEHELPSAVEASPECIESOFMONKEYS?

Ultimate Classic Rock;Rolling Stones Album Ad Details Confirmed by UK Newspaper Editor;A cryptic Rolling Stones-related advertisement appeared in two neighborhood London newspapers in August 2023.;"The Rolling Stones' record label placed a pair of ads hinting at new music, two neighborhood London newspapers confirm.References to Stones songs were woven throughout the advertisements, which were supposedly for a company called Hackney Diamonds. Broad speculation followed that this might be the title of a new record. The Rolling Stones' familiar logo dotted the ""i"" in the word ""diamonds,"" and the promo also referenced 1962 – when the group was founded.Senior Editor Simon Murfitt says the ads – and the new album – are real. ""It's very exciting to have such a massive band announcing their new album in our papers, especially in such a cryptic manner,"" Murfitt said in a statement published in the Hackney Gazette and Islington Gazette.

The Rolling Stones' last album of original material dates back to 2005's A Bigger Bang.The ads, which also said ""Opening September 2023,"" sparked considerable excitement around the offices of these community publications. ""I have already had several emails requesting back copies,"" Murfitt added, ""and no doubt the papers will become collector's items for music fans.""The Rolling Stones have been discussing new music for several years. A collection of blues covers, 2016's Blue and Lonesome, actually grew out of ongoing sessions – but then Watts died. ""It'll be interesting to find out the dynamics now that Steve's in the band,"" Richards later told CBS Sunday Morning. ""It's sort of metamorphosing into something else.""CNN confirmed that Paul McCartney sat in with the Rolling Stones for one song.

Ultimate Classic Rock;David Crosby Was Prepping Tour Return: ‘He Hadn’t Lost His Fire’;David Crosby's collaborators revealed the rocker had been planning to return to touring prior to his death in January 2023.;David Crosby had been preparing to return to touring prior to his death.According to friends and collaborators, the rocker had been rehearsing with an eye towards hitting the road this summer.“David didn’t think he was gonna last for years, which he joked about all the time. But there was no sense that we weren’t gonna be able to do this show and these tours,” guitarist Steve Postell, who was poised to be part of the trek, revealed to Variety.“We were talking tour buses, and what kind of venues, and the whole team was all back together again — the road manager and tour manager and sound guys — on top of this band we’d put together,” Postell continued. “There was not even a remote sense that we weren’t about ready to hit the world. And it’s a shame people didn’t get to hear it.”The fact that Crosby was prepping to hit the road is notable, considering the rocker had previously insisted his touring days were over. “I’m too old to do it anymore,” the folk singer declared during a 2022 interview. “I’m too old to do it anymore. I don’t have the stamina. I don’t have the strength.”Conversely, Postell insisted Crosby was “practically giddy” to return to the stage. “He was showing us new songs, like, ‘What do you think of these lyrics?’ He hadn’t lost the fire. I’d like people to know that he was on it. He was writing, playing, singing his ass off and preparing a fantastic show. That’s what he was doing. He was not lying in a bed for two years, out of it. That’s not what happened at all.”26 Rock Stars Inducted Into the Hall of Fame More Than OnceSome of the biggest names in music history - along with a few surprises - have repeated the feat.;2023-01-22;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-crosby-tour-plans-before-death/;2023-01-27;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKDAVIDCROSBYWASPREPPINGTOURRETURN:‘HEHADN’TLOSTHISFIRE’
Ultimate Classic Rock;Turtles' Mark Volman Reveals Dementia Diagnosis;Turtles co-founder Mark Volman revealed he was suffering from Lewy body dementia, which would eventually end his life, in June 2023.;The Turtles’ Mark Volman revealed he had been diagnosed with a severe form of dementia in 2020 but vowed to keep touring for as long as he was able.Lewy body dementia, which notably led to comedian Robin Williams' death in 2014, involves hallucinations, physical tremors and confusion. Symptoms become worse over time, with most patients dying within eight years of diagnosis. Volman expressed determination in a new interview with People, saying, “I got hit by the knowledge that this was going to create a whole new part of my life. And I said, ‘OK, whatever’s going to happen will happen, but I’ll go as far as I can.’”The 76-year-old guitarist and singer said he started to notice something was wrong in 2018. “I remember slurring, and I wasn’t sure what was going on,” he recalled. “My brain wandered. I’d go off track. It made no sense.” During the interview, he asked if a sofa in the room was a woman whose head was bleeding, and on being assured that no one else could see it, he continued with the interview.“Right now, for me, it’s not scary, although it probably should be,” Volman reflected. His latest Happy Together tour – named after the Turtles’ biggest hit, but no longer featuring lifelong friend Howard Kaylan, who retired in 2018 – is underway, and he’s found it’s best if he travels between shows by bus. “It’s the safest place for me to be. I can’t get lost or hurt,” he explained. (Volman and Kaylan have also performed as Flo & Eddie.)His support group includes his two daughters and his two ex-wives, who help him manage medication and exercise regimes. His specialist physician, Kristen Pilote, admitted he was facing a “slow decline that will eventually interfere with his ability to function,” although she added that Volman “is an exception – he’s a great example of resilience in the setting of a debilitating illness. He’s upbeat and charismatic, and he’s surrounded by people who care about him.”Volman argued that “the challenges of this world affect everybody, and it’s been kind of fun being on the other side of a challenge like this and saying, ‘I feel good.’ My friends are here. I’m still here. And I want people to connect with me.”Top 100 '60s Rock AlbumsHere's a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '60s.;2023-06-15;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/mark-volman-dementia/;2023-06-18;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKTURTLES'MARKVOLMANREVEALSDEMENTIADIAGNOSIS
Ultimate Classic Rock;David Lee Roth Teases Return for Van Halen Tribute Project;David Lee Roth teased about a potential return as part of an Eddie Van Halen tribute project, saying, “I’m only on my first retirement” in June 2022.;"David Lee Roth teased about a return to the stage as part of a tribute to Eddie Van Halen.The original Van Halen singer – who appeared to have retired after announcing a run of final performances that were later canceled – once again remained difficult to lock down about his plans when he was interviewed by Fox News at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this week.Asked if he was planning a return to touring, Roth said, ""There’s always a tomorrow for a singer; not so much for a trombone player these days. ... How many times did Rocky retire? Seven. I think number three was my favorite. How many times did Rambo have to come out of retirement in order to make the sequel?""The topic of a Van Halen tribute project surfaced recently when artists including Michael Anthony, Joe Satriani and Jason Newsted discussed a suggestion that came from Alex Van Halen. When the reporter asked Roth to comment on whether he might be involved, the singer replied: ""Yeah – I wrote the songs. … I was the one who named the band. ... I’m only in the middle of my first retirement.""He’d first addressed the tribute concept in a brief statement in April, saying, “In my mind, ‘Van Halen 4K,’ in the age of COVID is going to require two of us for every position. Satriani and [Steve] Lukather, Anthony and Newsted, Al or Tommy Lee.”In September 2021, nearly a year after Eddie Van Halen’s death, Roth noted that “my guitarist passed away,” adding: “He's either in heaven raisin' hell. Or he's in hell, consequently in heaven. Read into that as you wish. And he would have me say it just like that. And I carry on that spirit deliberately.” He also said he’d “just spoke” to Alex Van Halen, and that the pair was “about to celebrate our 50th year of ragging on each other.”Van Halen Lineup ChangesThree different singers and two different bassists joined the Van Halen brothers over the years.";2022-06-02;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-lee-roth-van-halen-tribute/;2022-06-02;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKDAVIDLEEROTHTEASESRETURNFORVANHALENTRIBUTEPROJECT
Ultimate Classic Rock;The Story of ‘Jane,’ Jefferson Starship’s Track in ‘Cocaine Bear’;Jefferson Starship's 1979 single Jane - a moment of change for the band - appeared in the movie 'Cocaine Bear' in February 2023.;"The first music you’ll hear in the new comedy-horror movie Cocaine Bear is the song “Jane,” released in 1979 by Jefferson Starship. It’s a track that represents big changes in the history of a band renowned for them.Formerly Jefferson Airplane, the group had lost vocalists Grace Slick and Marty Balin in the run-up to their fifth album, Freedom at Point Zero. They hired former Journey drummer Aynsley Dunbar and, up front, gambled on singer Mickey Thomas – who wasn’t even sure he wanted to be in a rock band.“I had recently left the Elvin Bishop Band, which was all about the blues and soul music and R&B and country and every other kind of roots or organic music you could think of,” Thomas told Something Else in 2013. “But I was flattered to get the call, and I at least owed them the courtesy of going over there and seeing what’s up.” Despite a series of positive jam sessions, he still felt “rather hesitant” until, months later, deciding: “As crazy as this is, and as unlikely as it would be that this would work, there’s something there.” He called the results “a meeting of styles that created something original.""Listen to Jefferson Starship’s ‘Jane’“Jane” proved to be the perfect showcase for Thomas’ talents, pointing the band towards the stadium rock sound that would see them through the ‘80s as Starship, complete with more legal and lineup turmoil. But that hadn’t been bassist David Freiberg’s intention when he came up with the idea. “Actually, when [co-writer] Jim McPherson and I wrote ‘Jane,’ I was trying for the style of the Rolling Stones baroque period of the '60s,” he admitted in an undated interview. Guitarist Craig Chaquico intervened: “[He] came up with the great hard rock arrangement, and thank goodness for that!” Of the subject matter, Freiberg said: “Let us say that it was loosely about an old girlfriend of mine whose name wasn’t Jane.”To power the story of a wayward love interest who seems determined to self-destruct her relationship with the narrator, Chaquico came up with a driving riff-led vibe. “I remember arguing over the guitar solo with our manager at that time,” he said in 2012. “[H]e came in with a stopwatch and [argued] the guitar solo was too long. It will never get played on the radio, right?” But he continued: “The band backed me up, and we left the solo the way that it is, but our manager swore it would never be a hit. So, every time I hear it on the radio, it puts a smile on my face, because I knew I had to fight for every second of it! … We pushed the envelope, and it actually did get played – thank God.”“Jane” peaked at No. 14. Along with its spot in Cocaine Bear, it was used in the opening scene of the 2001 movie Wet Hot American Summer and its two associated Netflix series. It’s also heard in the Grand Theft Auto IV game and Rock Band 4. The song also currently serves as the entrance music for All Elite Wrestling star Orange Cassidy, who based his character on Paul Rudd's performance in Wet Hot American Summer.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Watch Roger Waters’ Heated TV Argument Over 'Communicating';Roger Waters challenged a TV reporter’s position regarding politics and war – but said it was a “pleasure” in August 2022.;"Roger Waters engaged in a heated argument on TV, challenging a reporter’s position on world politics and war – but adding it had been a “pleasure” to debate with him.CNN’s Michael Smerconish appeared to have set out to push Waters into controversial territory, although the musician is well-known for happily going there anyway.The interview – which can be seen below – began with a question about the introduction to Waters’ This is Not a Drill shows, where he tells the audience: “If you’re one of those ‘I love Pink Floyd but I can’t stand Roger’s politics’ people, you might do well to fuck off to the bar right now.” Asked if he really wanted people to leave, the musician replied: “You never know; those people, if they sit in a community like my audiences… there is such a great feeling of communication in that room between me and the audience, and between us combined with all our brothers and sisters all over the rest of the world.”He continued: “If This is Not a Drill has a message, it is that we have to communicate, one with the other.” That led Smerconish to say he didn’t always agree with Waters’ messages, but he countered: “I’ve only got one message: ‘Two strangers passing in the street / By chance two passing glances meet / And I am you and what I see is me.’ That is my message and that was on Meddle which was in 1970; and basically my message hasn’t changed – I recognize your humanity but I recognize all the Russians and the Chinese and the Ukrainians and the Yemenis and the Palestinians.”The discussion turned to Waters’ labeling of U.S. President Joe Biden a “criminal” who was “just getting started” after he’d previously hammered Donald Trump during an earlier tour. Waters blamed Biden’s administration for failing to prevent the Ukraine invasion from taking place, saying: “This war is basically about the action and reaction of NATO pushing right up to the Russian border – which they promised they wouldn’t do when Gorbachev negotiated the withdrawal of the U.S.S.R. from the whole of Eastern Europe.”When Smerconish argued that the United States had a role as “liberators” Waters responded: “You have no role as liberators… you got into World War II [because of] Pearl Harbor. You were completely isolationist until that sad, that devastating, awful day. … Thank God the Russians had already won the bloody war, almost, by then. Don’t forget 23 million Russians died protecting you and me from the Nazi menace.”Drawing a comparison to the Russian view of the current East European conflict, Waters said: “Try to figure out what the United States would do it the Chinese were putting nuclear armed missiles into Mexico and Canada.” Smerconish countered that China was too busy “encircling” Taiwan to turn on the U.S. but Waters argued: “They aren’t encircling Taiwan – Taiwan is part of China and that’s been absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948.”He went on to described allegations of China committing human rights atrocities on its own citizens as “bollocks,” saying that, unlike the U.S., “The Chinese didn’t invade Iraq and kill a million people in 2003.” He insisted: “You can’t have a conversation about human rights and you can’t have a conversation about Taiwan without actually doing the reading.”Drawing the debate to a close, Smerconish said that when he read, he read Waters’ liner notes. The pair ended with a handshake as Waters laughed: “It’s always a pleasure.” Smerconish deadpanned: “Is it?”The This is Not a Drill tour runs until Oct. 15.Watch Roger Waters and Michael Smerconish's DebateTop 50 Progressive Rock ArtistsFrom Kansas and Can to King Crimson and Curved Air. Next: The 10 Heaviest Pink Floyd Songs";2022-08-04;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/roger-waters-cnn/;2022-08-10;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWATCHROGERWATERS’HEATEDTVARGUMENTOVER'COMMUNICATING'
Ultimate Classic Rock;Paul McCartney Admires How John Lennon Dealt With ‘Tragic Life’;Paul McCartney discussed the tragedies John Lennon faced in life in a June 2023 conversation at the Tribeca Film Festival.;Paul McCartney recognizes that John Lennon lived a “really tragic life” and he admires the way his bandmate dealt with it.The late Beatles star endured a challenging childhood and continued to encounter difficulties in later years, his bandmate and co-songwriter said at the Tribeca Film Festival.He and Conan O’Brien were discussing photos from McCartney’s new book 1964: Eyes of the Storm. O’Brien selected an image of Lennon seated in the back of a car around the age of 23, saying it carried an air of anxiety and vulnerability. “I don’t know about the anxiety, but the vulnerability is very true,” McCartney replied.1964: Eyes of the Storm contains nearly 300 pictures taken by McCartney as the Beatles rose to superstardom. He thought he’d lost the trove of shots long ago, before they were rediscovered. “What I love about them is the innocence,” McCartney said. “We didn’t know we were going to get famous. We really wanted to be, but we didn’t know.”McCartney recently admitted that the Beatles’ first trip to the U.S. led to the realization that they were going to be more than a short-lived success. His Tribeca conversation included more thoughts on their arrival at John F. Kennedy Airport on Feb. 7, 1964: “We were very excited just to be on the plane,” he said. “They got word back to us that there was a big crowd, so we kind of half knew what to expect – but then it was a really big crowd and we were just bowled over. It was nice.“Immediately after, we did a press conference at the airport,” McCartney added. “We knew that whatever they laid on us, if there was any sort of insult, we knew we could come back with: ‘Well, we are No. 1 in your country!’”This talk will be released as a future episode of the Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend podcast. McCartney’s book is on sale now.

Ultimate Classic Rock;'Wild' Mick Brown Reveals Why He Quit Drumming Two Years Ago;Former Dokken member 'Wild' Mick Brown said he retired two years earlier in June 2023.;"Former Dokken drummer “Wild” Mick Brown revealed he stopped playing two years ago after he decided that a planned hiatus was his retirement.He stepped back from touring in 2019, marking the end of a career that began in 1975 with the Boyz, followed by Xciter, before he joined Dokken in 1981. He also worked with Ted Nugent and Lynch Mob. In a new interview on the Rimshots With Sean podcast, the 66-year-old musician explained that he had achieved everything he wanted to.""My body started developing pain from playing drums,"" Brown said of his final road trip with Dokken. ""I was really getting tired, and it was really hard to walk through airports. ... And it didn’t occur to me to stop [until] I just blurted out to Don [Dokken], ‘I’ve gotta stop doing this. I can't do it anymore.’ And he got it immediately, like, ‘’Wow – I’m surprised you even made it this far with what you did to yourself!’""Along with the pain – which Brown said has subsided to a point since he quit – he cited traveling as another reason to stop. “The last thing I wanted to do was go to another airport or sit in a van going to the hotel or on a tour bus,” he noted. “I was done. And I just let the higher power go, ‘All right, you’re done.’ And I followed that.” You can hear the interview below.He reported he became disillusioned with not being part of Dokken’s recording lineup and felt like being only a touring member was a “real good job” but nothing like the experience he enjoyed in the past. “I loved the creative part of working,” he said. “Like when Jeff [Pilson] and George [Lynch] would write a song and deliver it to Don and show him what we had - that was a really satisfying thing. That was gone. My roadie was gone. … It went full circle from what you did when you were 14 to 63. I’m, like, ‘I’m back as a 14-year-old, except I’m really old. I have to set these drums up? Fuck that!’”Brown continued playing on occasion with a friend’s band but noted it amounted to performing six songs over two years. “I haven’t touched a drumstick in two years,” he added. “I did everything I wanted to do – tenfold more than I thought was gonna happen. … Looking back now, I’m so grateful. I literally cry tears of joy sometimes and just [think], ‘Wow – I did that!’”He predicted a quiet future, explaining, “I have no ambition anymore, and I’ve never really been ambitious with anything except music. I make enough money where I don’t have to do anything. And guess what? I don’t do anything! I ride that chopper – that’s really what my passion is. I do a lot of sleeping. And I don’t have anything I have to do, except enjoy my friends today. … That’s where I’m at, and I couldn’t be more pleased.”Top 100 '80s Rock AlbumsUCR takes a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '80s.";2023-06-01;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/mick-brown-dokken-retired/;2023-06-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCK'WILD'MICKBROWNREVEALSWHYHEQUITDRUMMINGTWOYEARSAGO
Ultimate Classic Rock;How Christine McVie Finally Completed a 'Real' Solo Debut;Christine McVie goes in depth on her self-titled 1984 solo project in an archival interview, calling the LP her 'real' debut.;"Christine McVie didn't record what she considered her first ""real"" solo album until 1983 – and it was still a project she didn't really expect.Fleetwood Mac had recently returned to double-platinum success with Mirage, followed by a lengthy world tour to promote it. ""I never had time to contemplate something like this,"" McVie told this writer at the beginning of 1984, after she released the 10-track Christine McVie album produced by Russ Titelman. Then Fleetwood Mac went on hiatus, and bandmates Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood began recording their own projects. McVie was happy enough to take a little time off – or so she thought.""After the last tour, I was shattered, being on the road so long,"" said McVie, who eventually took a lengthy break from Fleetwood Mac between 1998-2014. ""I wanted to spend time at home, fixing up my house, getting to know my dogs again. Of course, you can only do so much of that before getting bored.""A return to the studio produced Christine McVie, but it was not actually her solo debut. She'd recorded 1970's The Legendary Christine Perfect Album, aka Christine Perfect, under her maiden name. The LP brought McVie out of the British blues band Chicken Shack, while bridging the gap until she joined Fleetwood Mac. Future bandmates Danny Kirwan and then-husband John McVie helped out on the 12-song set, but McVie readily admitted that she was ""not keen on that album. I thought there wasn't much substance there, especially in my songwriting.""Listen to 'Ask Anybody' by Christine McVieEverything changed over the interim. McVie had become a hitmaker with Fleetwood Mac. She could now rely upon a sturdy creative process that already produced radio favorites such as ""Say You Love Me,"" ""You Make Lovin' Fun,"" ""Don't Stop,"" ""Over My Head,"" and ""Hold Me."" ""I did it pretty much how I'd write for [the band], just go through the ideas I had to see what was worth developing and went from there,"" she explained. McVie was again joined by some musical friends – primarily Todd Sharp, who co-wrote five songs and contributed three others. McVie co-wrote ""Ask Anybody"" with Steve Winwood and ""So Excited"" with future-Fleetwood Mac bandmate Billy Burnette. Buckingham played guitar on three tracks and contributed backing vocals to two, while. Fleetwood drummed on one song (""Ask Anybody""). Winwood played and sang on four and Eric Clapton contributed lead guitar to ""The Challenge,"" after hearing about the album from Winwood. McVie said she ""really just invited [Clapton] to come up and vacation in Montreux"" where she was recording in Mountain Studios at the suggestion of Queen's manager, ""but it's difficult to keep him out of the studio once he gets there,"" she said.Christine McVie did not sell like Fleetwood Mac releases – or even or Nicks' or Buckingham's – but it was a respectable success, hitting No. 26 on the Billboard 200 and scoring at Top 10 single with ""Got a Hold on Me,"" which was also No. 1 on Billboard's Rock and Adult Contemporary charts.She didn't intend to tour on her own, but changed her mind when solo projects by Buckingham and Nicks kept Fleetwood Mac on hold. Watch Christine McVie's Video for 'Got a Hold on Me'McVie assembled a band with Sharp, Burnette and then-boyfriend and future husband Eddie Quintela, and played shows that included nine songs from the album and a generous selection of her Fleetwood Mac favorites – including deep cuts such as ""Just Crazy Love"" and ""Spare Me a Little of Your Love.""""It's very different from when Fleetwood Mac tours,"" McVie noted. ""It's a lot smaller scale. We're not doing the limousine treatment this time around. This is something I haven't done in a while, playing in small places. This is a bit like the old days, actually. It's quite fun to do. However, it's nothing I'd take on as a career.""Two decades would pass before 2004's In the Meantime, released while she was on the break from Fleetwood Mac. This 12-song follow up was co-written mostly with her nephew Dan Perfect, who co-produced with McVie and longtime Fleetwood Mac studio hand Ken Caillat. Burnette returned for one track (""Givin' It Back""), and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers drummer Steve Ferrone sat in.As with Christine McVie, the underrated In the Meantime was somewhat accidental. ""I didn't start off with the intention of making a record at all,"" McVie said at the time. ""Quite strictly for my own amusement I started writing with my nephew Dan. There seemed to be an accumulation of kind of interesting songs, and word got spread amongst certain friends in the business and one thing led to another and people suggested I put a CD together. I'm not planning on resurrecting my career as such. I just thought, 'Well, why not?'""McVie rejoined her old band 10 years later, and stayed through Fleetwood Mac's most recent tour in 2018-2019. She'd released the solo compilation Songbird this past June with a new orchestral version the title song, an old Fleetwood Mac favorite.Christine McVie Through the Years: Photo GalleryPictures from throughout the career of Christine McVie.Why Don't More People Like This Fleetwood Mac Album?";2022-12-07;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/christine-mcvie-self-titled-album/;2022-12-07;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKHOWCHRISTINEMCVIEFINALLYCOMPLETEDA'REAL'SOLODEBUT
Ultimate Classic Rock;Mick Mars Claims Motley Crue Is Ripping Him Off in New Lawsuit;Mick Mars accused his Motley Crue bandmates of ripping him off and faking their parts onstage in a lawsuit filed in April 2023.;"Mick Mars has filed a lawsuit against his Motley Crue bandmates, claiming they're ripping him off financially and trying to fully remove him from the band — and accusing them of onstage fakery during the 2022 Stadium Tour.The Crue guitarist of 41 years announced his retirement from touring last October, ceding his position to John 5. He cited his well-documented ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic, inflammatory form of arthritis that has gradually impaired his movement. The band stated at the time clarifying that Mars would ""continue as a member of the band, but can no longer handle the rigors of the road.""Mars' newly filed legal papers, however, suggest that his retirement from the road was far from amicable, and was instead a coordinated effort from his bandmates to oust him from the group against his will.For now, Mars' lawsuit only demands that his bandmates — Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil and Tommy Lee — hand over documents related to their businesses before both parties go to arbitration. But the suit also accuses the band of deliberately withholding information about the various businesses in which Mars is a 25% owner, Variety reports. Mars claims the band forced him to sign a severance agreement that would divest him of these and future businesses in exchange for a 5% stake in Motley Crue's ongoing tour and 0% in future tours. The same cut would apply to merchandise featuring Mars, and he would earn nothing off merchandise featuring John 5.This arrangement runs contrary to the many scenarios in which longtime members of bands maintain their shareholder rights even if they quit or get fired, as the lawsuit explains. ""Countless members have left countless bands (typically after much less than 41 years), or died, and still maintained (or their estates maintained) their shareholder, officer, and director status, as well as their concomitant right to profits,"" a footnote reads.The lawsuit states that after Mars refused to sign the papers from his bandmates — and subsequently rejected a counteroffer to earn 7.5% off Motley Crue's 2023 tour — the band moved to arbitration ""rather than a public lawsuit so that the public would not be aware of the deplorable manner in which they treated their 'brother' of 41 years.""Furthermore, Mars maintains that his bandmates have attempted to remove him from Motley Crue entirely and that Sixx, in particular, has disparaged his playing for years — which he finds hypocritical, given the band's performance on the 2022 Stadium Tour. ""During much of the band's recent tenure, Sixx continually 'gaslighted' Mars by telling him that he [Mars] had some sort of cognitive dysfunction and that his guitar playing was subpar, claiming that Mars forgot chords, and sometimes started playing the wrong songs.""Astonishingly, Sixx made these claims about Mars' playing while he [Sixx] did not play a single note on bass during the entire U.S. tour,"" the suit continues. ""Ironically, 100% of Sixx's bass parts were nothing but recordings. Sixx was seen fist pumping in the air with his strumming hand, while the bass part was playing. In fact, a significant portion of [Vince] Neil's vocals were also pre-recorded. Even some of [Tommy] Lee's drum parts were recordings. Some fans actually noticed that Lee was walking toward his drum set as they heard his drum part begin.""The suit concedes that Mars did occasionally make mistakes onstage, but they were the result of technical difficulties. ""Mars, at times on the tour, did play the wrong chords, but not due to any cognitive dysfunction,"" the paperwork says. ""He was playing live, and his in-ear monitors were constantly malfunctioning, causing Mars to be unable to hear his own instrument.""The fact is that Mars is rarely mocked or criticized online,"" it continues. ""He is a quiet member of the group, who shows up to play and puts his heart and soul into each performance.

Ultimate Classic Rock;David Gilmour and the Orb Announce 'Metallic Spheres in Colour';David Gilmour and the Orb announced that 'Metallic Spheres in Colour,' a reimagining of their collaborative album 'Metallic Spheres,' will be released in September 2023.;"David Gilmour and electronic group the Orb have announced Metallic Spheres in Colour, a remixed and reimagined version of their 2010 collaborative album.“The idea for Metallic Spheres in Colour, was that Alex Paterson [founder of the Orb] could have done more on the first version, and he didn’t really have the opportunity because we had a philosophy of making the music like the Blade Runner soundtrack meets Wish You Were Here,” explained Youth, the project’s producer, in a press release. “So, I asked him, Why don’t we remix it and make it like an Orb classic? And in doing that, it’s almost like a completely different album.”Released in 2010, Metallic Spheres found Gilmour combining his distinctive guitar, vocals and songwriting with the Orb’s ambient electronic landscape. The result was two suites – “Metallic” and “Spheres” – each made up of five movements.Metallica Spheres in Colour follows a similar structure, with a pair of suites titled “Round” and “Flat.” An excerpt from Metallic Spheres in Colour called ""Movement 1"" can be heard now.Metallica Spheres in Colour will be released on Sept. 29 and is available for preorder. The album will be available in multiple formats, including vinyl LP, CD and digital Dolby Atmos surround sound.This marks Gilmour’s first album since the 2017 live LP Live at Pompeii. Gilmour put out the song “Yes, I Have Ghosts” in 2020, while Pink Floyd released a stand-alone single “Hey, Hey, Rise Up” in 2022.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Ann Wilson’s Offer to Front Led Zeppelin Was Met With 'Crickets';An Wilson revealed that's she'd offered to front Led Zeppelin but never got a response during an interview in March 2022.;"Ann Wilson said that she previously offered to front a band made of former Led Zeppelin members, but never received a response.The revelation came during Wilson’s appearance on U.K. radio station Planet Rock.""Zeppelin always was a boy's club,” the Heart singer opined. “I know that because there was a minute when the rumor was that they were auditioning singers and I just threw my hat in the ring.”Wilson was referring to a period of time around early 2008. After Led Zeppelin -- with Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham’s son, Jason -- staged a hugely successful reunion at the O2 Arena in London in December 2007, some members of the group wanted to push forward with further performances. Plant declined, instead choosing to focus on his solo career, so Page and Jones decided to audition potential singers to see if they could find a match.Wilson was interested, but she couldn’t get a response.“I went, 'I'm here!’ and it was crickets,"" the Heart singer recalled.“Who knows what went on there?,"" Wilson pondered when further questioned about the experience. ""But anyway, who would want to hire somebody that could sing just like Plant? I don't think that's what they were into, you know? I don't think they want it to be a caricature of Led Zeppelin.”Despite the cold response, Wilson remained a fan of the band. In 2012, she performed a powerful rendition of Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” at the Kennedy Center Honors. Her performance was so well-received that it later led to questions about whether she’d ever want to front Led Zeppelin in Plant’s place.“Hypothetically, if they ever needed a lead singer and Heart was not active at the moment, then, sure, I would,"" Wilson said in 2014.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Bill Wyman Reportedly Performs on New Rolling Stones Studio Album;It was reported that Bill Wyman would perform on a Rolling Stones album for the first time since 1989 in June 2023.;"Bill Wyman has reportedly reunited with the Rolling Stones in the studio, performing on one track for a new album described as a tribute to drummer Charlie Watts.According to the Sun, Wyman flew out to Los Angeles several months ago to join the Stones' recording sessions in Los Angeles at the invitation of singer Mick Jagger. ""Bill hasn't seen the band together for years, but always loved Charlie,"" said an unnamed source. ""This record's really a tribute to Charlie, so he couldn't say no.""The last Rolling Stones studio album to feature Wyman on bass was 1989's Steel Wheels. He left the band in 1992, eager to live a more normal life. ""I had 30 years with them, then a really nice divorce and as corny as it sounds, we are still family,"" he later explained.He joined the band onstage in 2012 for a 50th anniversary concert in London, but later expressed disappointment over only being invited to play two songs instead of the whole show. ""If you try to go back and have a relationship with someone, it doesn't work, and it's the same musically,"" he declared in 2013. ""It was a one-off. Five minutes. OK, never again. No regrets, we're still great friends.""The Stones have been working sporadically on a new album for the better part of the last decade, with Jagger reporting as far back as November 2016 that the band had ""half an album"" of new material ready. This would be the first Rolling Stones studio album since 2016's blues covers album Blue and Lonesome, and the first to feature original songs since 2005's A Bigger Bang.This long gestation period means that Watts, who died in August 2021, will still be heard on the new record. ""It was really nice for Mick, Keith [Richards] and Ronnie Wood to be back in the studio remembering Charlie, and playing and singing to drum tracks that are being repurposed and woven into the album,"" explained the Sun's source.Paul McCartney will also play bass on one track from the as-yet untitled new album. This week marked the 60th anniversary of the Rolling Stones's debut single, a cover of Chuck Berry's ""Come On"" and the 45th anniversary of their 1978 comeback album Some Girls.

""Andrew Paul Woolfolk was his name. We lost him today, after being ill [for] over six years. He has transitioned on to the forever, from this land of the dying to the land of the living.""Great memories. Great Talent. Funny. Competitive. Quick-witted. And always styling,"" Bailey continued. ""Booski … I’ll see you on the other side, my friend.""You can see the post below.Born on Oct. 11, 1950, in Texas, Woolfolk moved to Colorado as a child and attended high school in Denver. He met Bailey in the Centennial State and joined Earth, Wind & Fire in 1973. Woolfolk's first album with EWF, 1973's Head to the Sky, also became their first platinum LP.The R&B and funk titans racked up several more platinum and multiplatinum albums throughout the '70s, peaking with 1975's chart-topping, triple-platinum That's the Way of the World, which spawned the No. 1 hit ""Shining Star."" Woolfolk's talents can also be heard on smash hits such as ""September,"" ""Sing a Song"" and EWF's cover of the Beatles' ""Got to Get You Into My Life.""Woolfolk also worked with other artists at the height of EWF's success, playing saxophone on Valerie Carter's Just a Stone's Throw Away and Deniece Williams' Song Bird, both in 1977. When EWF went on hiatus following 1983's Electric Universe, Woolfolk played on two of Bailey's solo gospel albums, 1984's Grammy-nominated The Wonders of His Love and 1986's Grammy-winning Triumph.Woolfolk continued to play with EWF when the band reconvened in 1987 and stayed with them through 1993. He continued working with other high-profile musicians after his departure, playing on several tracks on Phil Collins' 1996 album Dance Into the Light.

The recollection came as he told The Sun about some of the “stupid things” he’d done in his life.“Once, I was in Albuquerque, where they have this cable car, 1,000 feet up, going to a restaurant at the top of a small mountain,” he said. He didn’t remember anything about the journey until he was told the next day: “Well, you climbed through the roof of the cable car and stood on the roof singing Black Sabbath songs.”He added, “I looked up at it and a cold shiver went through my body. I had no clue I’d just done that.” Asked if he ever felt he was living on borrowed time, he replied, “I can’t complain because I’ve done some fucking stupid things in my life.”Osbourne said he also recently reflected on his experience with his wife Sharon as they celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary.""I said to Sharon, ‘What the fuck happened to 40 years?’"" he explained.

Ultimate Classic Rock;The Smile, 'A Light for Attracting Attention': Album Review;A review of the Smile's 2022 album, 'A Light for Attracting Attention.';"The debut album by the Smile can't help but feel a bit familiar because of the presence of three key architects of the Radiohead sound. Fronted by Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, along with drummer Tom Skinner from the London jazz outfit Sons of Kemet, and produced by Nigel Godrich, A Light for Attracting Attention places later-era Radiohead works like The King of Limbs and A Moon Shaped Pool within more open-ended contexts.The 13 tracks rarely force the Smile's ""side project"" status. Instead, they welcome new shades and textures into a songbook that's played against expectations for three decades. There's more space to breathe hereL ""Pana-vision,"" one of the more Radiohead-sounding songs on A Light for Attracting Attention, is less angular than it would be in the quintet's hands, and the minimal ""Speech Bubbles"" would glide toward ambient areas if not for Skinner's wave-breaking drums holding it back.It goes the other way, too: The post-punk thrust of ""You Will Never Work in Television Again"" is the fiercest Yorke has sounded in years, and ""Thin Thing"" comes close to what Kid A or Amnesiac would have probably sounded like if there was more guitar. Greenwood's slippery bass in ""The Smoke"" recalls another Yorke and Godrich detour, Atoms for Peace, in its dance-y groove.The best moments find the middle line. ""Free in the Knowledge"" and ""Skrting on the Surface"" emerged long before their appearances on A Light for Attracting Attention. Yorke performed the airy, gorgeous ""Free in the Knowledge"" solo a few months before the Smile made their live debut in January 2022, and ""Skrting on the Surface"" has been around since 2009, even showing up in Radiohead set lists in 2012.The comparisons to Yorke and Greenwood's full-time band are inevitable; there's no escaping the singer's fluid phrasing and their penchant for space-traversing sounds. But Skinner provides a more Can-like rhythmic gallop, and the songs aren't constrained by genre or style – not that Radiohead ever let that stop them either. At the very least, A Light for Attracting Attention deserves asterisk status alongside Radiohead's lush, expansive catalog.Radiohead Albums RankedThey used to wish they were special.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Ace Frehley Got a 'F--- You' but No Apology From Paul Stanley;Ace Frehley said he received a 'F--- you' from Paul Stanley after demanding an apology from his former bandmate in April 2023.;"Ace Frehley said he heard from Paul Stanley shortly after demanding an apology from his former Kiss bandmate last week — but all he received was a ""Fuck you"" during a five-second phone call.As promised last week, Frehley returned to Eddie Trunk's Trunk Nation today to offer an update on his ongoing war of words with Stanley and Gene Simmons. The Spaceman previously threatened to air ""some dirt"" on his ex-colleagues if Stanley did not apologize within a week for the disparaging remarks he made during a recent Howard Stern interview.When asked if Stanley contacted him, Frehley said, ""Yes, he did, not long after the show was over. I was blindsided by the phone call. ... But instead of an apology, I got a five-second phone call which said, 'Fuck you, Ace. I'm not going to apologize,' and hung up. ... He wasn't even man enough to let me give a rebuttal and explain why I'm so upset or anything like that.""Frehley said he has been in touch with Kiss manager Doc Mcghee ""at least three or four times"" since the phone call. ""I told Doc McGhee this whole story, and you know what he came back with? He said, 'Paul said he never called you.'"" The guitarist also sent screenshots of his phone call log to Trunk to confirm the conversation took place, which Trunk verified.Despite not receiving his apology, Frehley opted not to air any dirt on his former bandmates after all.""I spoke to several good friends of mine who are God-fearing people and I go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meetings with, and they said, 'Don't ever sink to their level. That's what they do. That's what they've been doing for years. Why are you going to sink to their level?'"" Frehley said. ""So then I came to the realization that I don't even have to bring up anything that I have hidden away in my attorney's safety deposit box. I can just talk about things that they've said about me in black and white. They can't come after me after that because they said it. It's in black and white.""Frehley's current feud with his ex-bandmates erupted last month when Kiss appeared on The Howard Stern Show. When the radio veteran asked why Stanley and Simmons refused to play alongside fellow founding members Frehley and Peter Criss at the band's 2014 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction, Stanley replied, ""Because if you saw people onstage who looked like Kiss but sounded like that, maybe we should be called Piss.""Frehley responded to these comments during last week's Trunk Nation appearance and reiterated many of his points during today's follow-up call. ""Those guys have been bad-mouthing me since I quit the very first time in 1981, 1982,"" he said. ""Calling me a drug addict, calling me an alcoholic, saying I'm unemployable, I'm undependable.""The guitarist additionally noted that he's maintained a multi-decade solo career, has been sober for nearly 20 years and has released more new music in that time than his old band. He then issued an ultimatum to Stanley.""I'm going to make a statement to Paul Stanley right now... I'm telling you that I want a formal apology for what you said, and a retraction and an apology within seven days,"" Frehley declared. ""And if I don't get that within seven days, I'm coming back on Ed Trunk's show — if you'll have me, Ed — and I'm going to tell some dirt that nobody knows about Paul and Gene, that I've always kept to myself because I'm the kind of guy who doesn't talk about this. I like to talk about positive stuff.""Frehley added that he's written a 120-page manuscript detailing Stanley and Simmons' alleged indiscretions. ""My attorney has it in a safety deposit box,"" he said. ""God forbid anything happens to me, my attorney is instructed to release it to The New York Times, Rolling Stone, API, everybody. So they can't intimidate me with trying to hurt me or saying, 'You better not say anything about me live on the radio,' because then they're totally screwed. Their careers will be ruined. ... Those guys aren't squeaky clean. You know how many lawsuits girls have had against Gene?""Despite their ongoing feud, Frehley reiterated during his latest Trunk Nation call that he could still be convinced to join his ex-bandmates onstage at Kiss' final shows at New York's Madison Square Garden this December — for a price. ""Money motivates me, just like it motivates them,"" he said. ""Look, if I got a quarter of a million dollars a night [for the final two shows] and I can make a half a million dollars for playing three or four songs, five songs, I'd take the money.""Kiss Lineup Changes: A Complete GuideAn in-depth guide to all of the personnel changes undergone by the ""hottest band in the land,"" Kiss.";2023-04-07;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ace-frehley-paul-stanley-phone-call/;2023-04-09;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKACEFREHLEYGOTA'F---YOU'BUTNOAPOLOGYFROMPAULSTANLEY

The group then inevitably turned to ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),"" their first big hit.This was the second time Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart have played together in 2022. The duo was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, where they delivered an acoustic rendition of ""Here Comes the Rain Again"" in June.“Sweet Dreams” was Eurythmics' first U.S. single, released after RCA tried for more than a year to find commercial success for the band and the 1982 album of the same name overseas. A trio of singles from that sophomore effort sank with little reaction. But “Sweet Dreams” eventually changed their trajectory anyway, rising to the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and launching a string of chart success that included nine more Top 40 hits.Their sound was electronically based, but Eurythmics consistently kept a sharp focus on songwriting, as Stewart told Billboard earlier this year. “We insisted when we were writing our songs that you could play them with just a guitar and voice, or piano and voice,” he said. It was an important tactic, which he said helped their music rise above most ‘80s pop that had been dismissed as “disposable.”Top 100 '80s Rock AlbumsUCR takes a chronological look at the 100 best rock albums of the '80s.";2022-11-06;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/eurythmics-rock-hall-performance-2022/;2022-11-06;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKEURYTHMICSCELEBRATEROCKANDROLLHALLOFFAMEINDUCTION

In a recent interview with Variety, he revealed he spent months behind a drum kit ahead of shooting.“It’s not easy to do,” he said of Lee’s stick-twirling trick. “My fingers were swollen for a good week and a half. I kept hitting myself in the head with it.” His preparations also included fasting to slim down and undergoing hours of temporary tattoo application, which required regular touching up.“I looked at the tattoos as sort of being a costume in itself,” he explained, adding that the nipple rings are artificial.

They were constantly working with it, trying things and finding that nuance. It’s that thing of not doing an impersonation but trying to capture the essence of what the [real people] were feeling. That’s the tricky part, and I think they both nailed it.”Stan argued that the drama surrounding Lee and Anderson’s stolen sex tape was an ""important story.""

In 2007, he surprised an audience of fans at a Guster concert in Boston when he burst through a homemade paper banner that had been constructed a few hours before.The Boston alt-rock band was scheduled to perform a show at the Boston Opera House when band members noticed that Saget was performing a sold-out show down the street at the Orpheum Theatre. They reached out to Saget's management, asking if he might be interested in tearing through a paper banner that night during the encore. To their surprise, management told them to go ahead and make the banner.(The actor and comedian best known for his role on ABC's Full House died yesterday at age 65.)That evening, during the band's encore, the homemade banner was held up onstage as the group led the audience in a chant of ""Bob! Bob! Bob!"" It was then that drummer Brian Rosenworcel realized they had forgotten to tell singer and guitarist Adam Gardner about the plan. ""He's strumming his guitar super-aggressively because he thinks this is a lame joke, an exercise in anticlimax,"" Rosenworcel wrote in a Twitter thread, ""that we’ll have our bus driver or our guitar tech burst through and then play a deflated encore after riling up the crowd with an unfulfilled promise.""Except the promise actually was fulfilled – Saget burst through the banner to an ecstatic crowd. The moment was captured on film by an audience member. ""The crowd went fuckin' bananas,"" Rosenworcel remembered. ""He hugged [singer and guitarist] Ryan [Miller], shook the band members' hands, waved at the crowd, told Ryan, 'This is awesome' and walked offstage.""You can watch the moment below.""I have also enjoyed thinking about this from Saget’s perspective,"" Rosenworcel wrote in his tour blog that week. ""The guy performs at the Orpheum to a sold-out crowd, but before heading home to the hotel, he has his limo take a pit stop at the Boston Opera House, where some band he’s never heard of has invited him to make a random appearance. He walks onstage, breaks through a homemade banner with his name on it, waves at a crowd that is going gaga because they fuckin' loved Full House, shakes the band’s hands, tells Ryan, 'This is awesome' and then heads to the hotel.""According to Rosenworcel, several years later Miller ran into Saget in Los Angeles while hanging out with a mutual friend, actor Jeff Garlin. Miller asked Saget if he remembered appearing at a Guster concert in Boston. ""Saget lit up,"" Rosenworcel recalled in the Twitter thread. ""'I got in a car which drove me to a venue, walked directly on stage, the crowd erupted, I walked offstage and got right back in a car. It was the best!' It really was. RIP, Bob Saget.""In Memoriam: 2021 DeathsRemembering the musicians, actors, producers and others who have died in 2021.";2022-01-10;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-saget-guster-concert/;2022-03-04;9999-12-31;1;ULTIMATECLASSICROCKWHENBOBSAGETCRASHEDAROCKCONCERT
Ultimate Classic Rock;Why Charlie Watts Was Last to Join Rolling Stones End-of-Show Bow;Mick Jagger explained why late drummer Charlie Watts was always the last to join the bow at the end of their shows in May 2022.;"Mick Jagger said late Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts was always the last to join the bow at the end of shows because of his obsession with neatness.Watts, who died last August at the age of 80, was renowned for his impeccable presentation in terms of personal appearance and musicianship.In a recent interview with the Sunday Times, Jagger explained how this obsessive streak played out during Stones concerts. ""In the show, when we come to the front and bow at the end, there's no Charlie,"" he said. ""He'd always be the last one down. I'd go: ‘Come on, what have you got to do?' He'd be fiddling with his sticks because he always had to have them in a row before he'd get off the seat!""The vocalist also reflected on getting used to the drummer's absence, saying, ""I don't really expect him to be there anymore if I turn 'round during a show. But I do think about him. Not only during rehearsals or on stage, but in other ways too. I would have phoned him up and talked about last night's Arsenal game because he supported Tottenham and I'm Arsenal. I miss him as a player and as a friend.""With work continuing on a new Stones album, Jagger also reflected on the band's longevity. ""[We're] getting more mature,"" he said. ""I'm not joking. It's true, and it's taken a long time. We're in a very immature business. I'm under no illusions about that. But it doesn't mean that you have to be immature.""The Rolling Stones recently announced their 60th-anniversary tour, which Jagger said they would handle with a ""light touch."" When asked in March if they would invite former members to make guest appearances, the singer told Rolling Stone, ""We're not going to go there, I don't think.

Ultimate Classic Rock;Hear Ozzy Osbourne's 'Degradation Rules' Featuring Tony Iommi;Ozzy Osbourne teamed up with Tony Iommi on the solo single 'Degradation Rules,' released on July 22, 2022.;"Ozzy Osbourne has teamed up with former Black Sabbath bandmate and guitarist Tony Iommi on his new solo single, ""Degradation Rules.""While the four-minute song doesn’t sound exactly like a Sabbath piece, it features a number of their trademark touches, including harmonica, dramatic tempo changes and Iommi’s heavy riffing. It follows the story of a character who’s living a “twisted little fantasy” with “sticky little magazines”; as he spends his time “gambling with tragedy and doom” he sinks into a world of being “addicted to debauchery.” It’s explicitly self-explanatory. You can hear the song below.""Degradation Rules"" is the second single the Prince of Darkness has released from his upcoming solo album, Patient Number 9, which arrives on Sept. 9. He previewed the LP last month with the seven-and-a-half-minute title track, featuring Jeff Beck on guitar. Other six-string collaborators on the star-studded Patient Number 9 include Eric Clapton, Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme and Osbourne's stalwart solo guitarist Zakk Wylde.Additionally, the album will feature Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo and a posthumous appearance from Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins. Smith and McKagan also played on Osbourne's 2020 album Ordinary Man.""Degradation Rules"" marks the first time Osbourne and Iommi have collaborated outside of Black Sabbath. ""It was really great working with Tony,"" Osbourne said in a recent fan Q&A. ""He's the riff master. No one can touch him in that respect. I only wish we had these songs for Black Sabbath's 13 album.""Last month, Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, said the singer was ""doing well and on the road to recovery"" following major surgery. Sharon did not offer any details about the nature of the surgery, but she told the British TV show The Talk that it was ""a very major operation"" that was ""really going to determine the rest of his life.""""I am now home from the hospital recuperating comfortably,"" Osbourne tweeted on June 15.

When presenter Sally Nugent asks, ""That single, Head On A Stick, it's a political song, isn't it?"" Matlock responds, ""It's kinda verging that way.""

""It was written over the last year-and-a-half, two years, through the whole Brexit debacle that's been going on,"" he explains, ""the loss of our freedom of movement as musicians, with all the sorts of things that have been going on with the government, and [recently-sacked Tory Party chairman Nadhim] Zahawai and people like that, that I felt I could see coming a little bit.""

""I'm a big fan of a guy called Pete Seeger who wrote the song If I Had A Hammer, you know, he'd hammer out a warning about things, so the song has got all those kind of things to do with it.""

""It’s coming from an album that's called Consequences Coming, which is coming out at the end of April… and I think there are some consequences coming for the people who've been representing us... I think they've made a right cock-up of things, and I'd like to see their heads - metaphorically - on sticks.""Asked if he's still as angry as he was during ""the Pistols days"", Matlock replies, ""In a a different way.""

""I'm not angry,"" he continues, ""I’m livid about the whole Brexit thing. I’m livid, as a musician, about the loss of our movement in 27 countries and how it’s hamstrung our chances of touring tyhe way we used to be able to do.”

""It's needless really,"" he adds. ""Especially when we were promised, as musicians, that with the Brexit thing we would still have a way of working and the EU offered the government a way around it… and our government turned it down.""Insisting that he can't see any benefits to Brexit, Matlock tells co-presenter Jon Kay, ""I know you're working for the BBC and you gotta, kinda, push the government line a little bit, but there's a whole bunch of people who think it's the worst thing that's ever happened.""Watch the video for Head On A Stick and Matlock's Breakfast interview below:

louder;Willow's new single Purge is surprisingly intense and heavy and we're here for it;Willow has dropped a video for her heaviest track to date, Purge ft. Siiickbrain;Willow has released a new single, Purge, ft. Siiickbrain.Possibly her heaviest release to date, Purge arrives with a music video released solely on YouTube: it'll be released officially onto streaming services on April 1.For the accompanying video, Willow emphasises her creative talents even further, taking on the role of director. In the video Willow and Siiickbrain, aka Caroline Miner Smith, can be seen causing havoc and general mayhem on a lust-fuelled romp across a gritty, graffiti-tagged city.There's kissing, car-smashing, and plentiful screaming in one another's faces, which makes for a perfect complement to the track's bottom-heavy guitar riffs. Throwing in another curveball and highlighting Willow's affinity for genre-bending, there's even a trap beat featured within the mix, which is deliciously unexpected.But it's perhaps not surprising to see Willow cross over into even heavier territories, given that her last handful of releases – from 2021's pop-punk-infused album Lately I Feel Everything to the recent fist-pumping emo anthem Emo Girl she recorded alongside Machine Gun Kelly – have consciously positioned her at a great distance from the pop-focused, mainstream outings of her early career. We are here for it.Watch Purge ft.

louder;Toyah beats aubergines and wears a basket on her head in latest broadcast with Robert Fripp;Green Day's classic Basket Case gets a makeover from progman Robert Fripp and post-punk pioneer Toyah Willcox;"Light entertainment icons Toyah Willcox and Robert Fripp have completed their latest broadcast to the nation, covering Green Day's 1984 punk banger Basket Case with the aid of two aubergines. The frisky duo enlivened this week's Sunday lunch performance with the help of an actual basket – one that Toyah dons at the beginning of the song, rendering her voice somewhat muffled – and two aubergines (or eggplants, as they're known in North America), which she uses to beat out a chaotic rhythm on a drum hanging from the ceiling. It's all over in less than two minutes, with the final words coming from Fripp, who says, ""may your basket overflow with love,"" a message of hope and conciliation at odds with the song's original themes of anxiety and disorder.  “Basket Case is about anxiety attacks and feeling like you’re about to go crazy,” Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong once said of the song. “At times, I probably was. I’ve suffered from panic disorders my entire life. I thought I was just losing my mind. The only way I could know what the hell was going on was to write a song about it. It was only years later that I figured out I had a panic disorder.""Earlier this month Robert Fripp announced the second Guitar Circle, a four-day event to be held at Glen Cove Mansion on Long Island, New York. It'll run August 22-26.""For the next Guitar Circle at Glen Cove, I am hoping audients will arrive in great number and perhaps even crowd out the guitarists,"" says Fripp. ""No interest in playing guitar? Great! Ears? Even better. Innocent ears?

louder;I’m a whisky geek who has too many bottles, but I'm all in on these Prime Day booze bargains;I’ve been into whisky for more than 10 years and have more bottles than I could ever possibly need... but I still can’t resist a bargain. Here are my Prime Day bottle picks;"I’ve been collecting and appreciating whisky for just over a decade - not as long as some, but I’ve still managed to amass quite a stash in that time - and even though I have enough bottles to keep me busy for the next 15 years, I just can’t resist a bargain. And with prices spilling all over the place this Prime Day, I thought I’d pick out some of the bottles that I think are worth your time, starting with 20% off the classic Lagavulin 16 year old. Amazon have cut the price from £76.50 to £61. It’s a favourite dram for many, and one that seems to start a lot of people on their journey of whisky discovery. While the price was hiked a while back, this is the cheapest I’ve seen this classy Islay malt in years.Lagavulin 16: Was £76.50, now £61
Owners Diageo hiked the price of this much-loved dram a few years ago. None of us were happy about that decision, but this deal takes it a little closer to where it was before the price rocketed. It's a classic scotch from the beautiful island of Islay and has fruit and smoke in abundance. It's presented at an easy-going 43% ABV.If you find the Lagavulin 16 a little tame, then you could always opt for the younger and feistier Lagavulin 8 year old which is on sale for £37 at Amazon - that’s down from its RRP of £47. This was introduced to the market in 2016 to celebrate the distillery’s 200th birthday and went on to become part of Lagavulin’s core range. This is a much more elemental dram that the 16 - more of a bite thanks to its youthful nature and the fact it’s bottled at 48%.For Irish whiskey fans, there’s 17% off the price of the ever-dependable Green Spot, down from £39.99 to £33. This pot still Irish whiskey has long been a go-to dram for me. It’s bottled at 40% but what it lacks in alcohol, it more than makes up for with its fruit-forward flavours and wonderfully rich mouth feel - something I find on many pot still-matured spirits.Off to the US now and the Sazerac Straight Rye whiskey which is available this Prime Day for just £26.99 rather than its usual price of £45. While this is an excellent sipper, it really comes into its own when plonked into a cocktail - the most obvious of which is the Sazerac. However, it also works in a Manhattan or Old Fashioned, which just happen to be two of my favourite cocktails.Glenmorangie 10: Was £38, now £28.90
The Glenmorangie 10 has recently undergone a bit of rebranding which is still dividing opinion. However, the whisky inside the bottle remains good quality and is a top pick for non-peat lovers. Here you’ll find fruit and I get loads of pineapples from this dram. It’s a regular purchase for me as it’s a great easy-sipping classic.View DealMy final whisky pick is one of my all-time favourites: Clynelish 14. This classic is down from £49.50 to £38 - a neat saving of 23%. Clynelish has a beautiful waxy flavour profile and it’s that particular taste which make this distillery one of Scotland’s favourites. Older versions are available from independent bottlers which can be stellar, but expect your bank balance to take a hit. Stick to this for a much cheaper option. Will it hang around at this price in the long run? Hard to tell given some of the pricing shenanigans of recent years, so take my advice and buy an extra one for the stash just in case.To wrap up, I've chosen a rum - and a hugely popular one at that: a litre of Kraken black spiced rum on sale at Amazon for Prime Day for £23.45. It normally retails around the £34 mark making this an excellent pick up. Great in cocktails - especially a Dark and Stormy and a great staple for your home bar. For this price, you can't go wrong.And don't forget that as Prime Day draws to a close, you'll still be able to find lots of bargains in our Prime Day music deals page, record player savings in our Prime Day turntable deals hub and if you're looking for some records, you'll find plenty of choice in our Prime Day vinyl deals list.Related guidesBest home beer dispensers: Prepare to pour the perfect pint this summerBest home brew kits: Create your own beer and ciderBest non-alcoholic beers: 10 of the tastiest teetotal tipplesBest gifts for beer lovers: Boozy present ideas for your ale-loving palsBest gifts for music fans: Gift ideas with a rock'n'roll twistBest Lego kits for adults: Band logos, guitars, Beatles sets & more";2023-07-12;https://www.loudersound.com/news/prime-day-alcohol-deals;2023-07-12;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERI’MAWHISKYGEEKWHOHASTOOMANYBOTTLES,BUTI'MALLINONTHESEPRIMEDAYBOOZEBARGAINS

We are eagerly looking forward to the Grand Final! We promise to go all out on Saturday,” say the band in a statement. “The Rasmus has been consistently confident since the early stages of UMK 2022, and it is an absolute thrill to see the renewed band in the Eurovision finals,” says Anssi Autio, producer at Finland's national broadcasting company, Yle. “The band has a completely new show, which has been executed in a spectacular way, as Eurovision viewers all around Europe have undoubtedly noticed. In addition to the band, the production process has involved numerous Finnish and foreign professionals, and I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to all of them.”The Rasmus will be the fourth act to perform at tomorrow's event, with viewers able to vote for them via phone, text or via the Eurovision app. The show will be broadcast on BBC 1 in the UK.Watch The Rasmus perform Jezebel at last night's Eurovision semi-final below.;2022-05-13;https://www.loudersound.com/news/the-rasmus-eurovision-final;2022-05-15;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDTHERASMUSMAKEITTHROUGHTOEUROVISION2022GRANDFINAL

Doing a tour of this scale is basically financial Russian roulette.""Having not being able to work for the best part of two years now, we find ourselves at a make or break crossroads, we didn’t get sufficient cover from the government. [our pre-covid accounts were so bad that any grants and furlough were extremely minimal – this is the way it’s been for many musicians and crews].""So rather than go headlong into a horrendous financial abyss I feel it’s better for us to cancel/postpone all our shows until we are 100% sure we can do this in a better environment.

It's the follow-up to 2021's The Battle At Garden's Gate. The news is accompanied by the release of the first single from the album, Meeting The Master, a slow-burning, other-worldly epic that begins with gentle acoustic guitar and a vocal from Josh Kizska that soars like a call to prayer, before the band come crashing in somewhere north of the two-and-an-half-minute mark. “Meeting The Master peers into an esoteric world heeded by the word of a wise teacher,"" explain Greta Van Fleet in a statement. ""Sung in the voice of a devout believer, and eventual group exclamation, the song details the love these fervent followers have for their teacher and their firm belief in his vision. It’s an exotic spiritual journey. A dark comedy that inevitably ends in chaos.""Starcatcher was recorded with Dave Cobb at his base at RCA Studios in Nashville, and finds the band exploring ""the duality of fantasy versus reality and the contrast between light and darkness.""""We had this idea that we wanted to tell these stories to build a universe,” says drummer Danny Wagner. “We wanted to introduce characters and motifs and these ideas that would come about here and there throughout our careers through this world.""""When I imagine the world of Starcatcher, I think of the cosmos,” explains bassist and keyboard player Sam Kizska. “It makes me ask a lot of questions, like ‘Where did we come from?’ or ‘What are we doing here?’ But it’s also questions like, ‘What is this consciousness that we have, and where did it come from?’”“We didn’t really have to force or be intense about writing, because everything that happened was very instinctual,” adds frontman Jake Kizska. “If anything, the record is our perspective, and sums up where we are as a group and individually as musicians.”Starcatcher is available to pre-order now (opens in new tab). Greta Van Fleet: Starcatcher tracklist

You can listen to the poignantly reflective So Much below.""I was trying purposefully not to be clever with this,"" Gabriel explains of the new song, which has been performed on the current tour. ""I wanted to get a very simple chorus but one which still had some substance to the harmony and melody. Something that was easy to digest but still had a bit of character to it. ""So Much is about mortality, getting old, all the bright, cheerful subjects, but I think when you get to my sort of age, you either run away from mortality or you jump into it and try and live life to the full and that always seems to make a lot more sense to me. The countries that seem most alive are those that have death as part of their culture.""""The reason I chose So Much as a title is because I’m addicted to new ideas and all sorts of projects. I get excited by things and want to jump around and do different things. I love being in a mess of so much! And yet it also means there's just so much time, or whatever it is, available. Balancing them both is what the song is about.""So Much features artwork from artist Henry Hudson and his work Somewhere Over Mercia.""I started looking at Henry's work and thought it was great,"" Gabriel continues. ""He's done some dense and intricate work with plasticine, but then he also has this other more expressionist, horizon work with different colours and they're very simple and pure. I connected quite strongly with him.  ""The works where Henry's got horizons are minimalist in a way. They are quite layered and there's a physicality or three-dimensional element to the way he puts the work together. The idea of cutting the horizon in a different colour, in this case he wanted it to be yellow, and then effectively letting it bleed onto the painting I thought was beautiful and powerful. In the one sense, the horizon is the infinite but it's also the limit. It had some good symbolism. I think it's a great piece of work.""As with previous full moon releases, So Much will come with differing mix approaches from Tchad Blake (Dark-Side Mix), released on 3 July, and also from Mark ‘Spike’ Stent (Bright-Side Mix) and Hans-Martin Buff’s Atmos mix (In-Side Mix), released later in the month.""One of the privileges of working with these extraordinary mixers is that they bring personality, sound textures, pictures, environments out of the elements that you throw at them that have strong individual characters,"" Gabriel adds.

louder;That Joe Payne reveals video trailer for new Xmas album;That Joe Payne has just released his brand new Christmas album Ding Dong!;"That Joe Payne has shared a video trailer for his brand new Christmas album, Ding Dong, which is released today. You can watch the lyric video for Christmas Cheer below.The new album was inspired by a Christmas Livestream of seasonal song-requests during the 2020 winter lockdown, Payne made the decision to write a festive album, including last year’s single, O Holy Night. Although originally intended as an album of carols, the singer spontaneously found himself writing several original songs instead, some only imagined and finished as recently as mid-November. What he ended up with is an eclectic mix of songs, ranging from medieval choir to modern R&B in style.""Every year I get more and more sick of hearing the same old Christmas songs on repeat,"" says Payne. ""However, when I first started doing some Christmas themes shows a couple of years ago, it occurred to me that I could actually begin to take some control of this problem by producing the music that I – and hopefully my listeners – would actually want to listen to, instead!""I’m incredibly proud of this album, and actually think that these songs are amongst the best I’ve ever written. Considering it only began as a bit of fun, it’s turned out surprisingly well, and I’ve every hope that the record has what it takes to cheer up even the grumpiest of humbugs.""The writing, recording, and arrangement took place at Payne’s home studio in Northampton between November 2021 - November 2022 and was engineered, mixed, and mastered by Max Read. Produced by That Joe Payne & Max Read. Guests include Joshua Ryan and Esmeralda Edwards.Get Ding Dong.(Image credit: Press)That Joe Payne: Ding Dong

I watched [Metallica] the other day. I was side of stage watching him from his little guitar world – well, massive guitar world – and it was so fucking sick. I’ve been trying to downplay it, but it was one of the best moments of my entire life. I fucking love Metallica. I’m stood there, watching him play, he comes over to change his guitar and he gives me a high five and goes, ‘Wait, I’ve got something for you!’""Hetfield quickly returned with a handful of his own personal plectrums and, most wholesomely of all, some throat lozenges, evidently looking out for his fellow vocalist's pipes.“He goes and gets this handful of stuff and then drops in my hand some plectrums and these little Vocalzone pills,"" Carter explains. ""They’re these little throat sweets and he goes, ‘These are going to save your life and save your throat.' This is in the middle of his fucking set and he’s literally giving out sweets!”To knock the anecdote up a notch, Carter goes on to reveal who first recommended the sweets to Hetfield - and it's not a fellow hard rock icon, but the Welsh Sex Bomb himself, Tom Jones!“He goes, ‘Do you know who put me on to these?’ I’m sitting there thinking, ‘Man, some fucking rock ’n’ roll legend’. Then he goes, ‘Tom fuckin’ Jones’, he puts his guitar back on and he goes back to the stage.

The two performances – organised by Eric Clapton and Sandra Beck, the guitarist's widow – will take place on May 22 and 23.The shows will feature a stellar cast of performers, with those who've already expressed an interest in taking part including Billy Gibbons, Rod Stewart, Gary Clark Jr., Johnny Depp, John McLaughlin, Susan Tedeschi, Derek Trucks, Doyle Bramhall II, Imelda May, Robert Randolph, Olivia Safe and Joss Stone.

Satriani also confirmed himself that talks with Alex Van Halen and David Lee Roth were in the works about the potential reconnection.Most recently, former vocalist Sammy Hagar came forward to express his interest in launching a tribute concert for the late Eddie Van Halen, who passed away in 2020. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Hagar said that he would ""love"" for the reunion to happen, and that he'd like to share the mic with David Lee Roth, ""where he’d sing ten of his songs, and then I’d come out and do ten of mine.""But in a new interview with Classic Rock magazine, Wolfgang Van Halen states that he thinks the likelihood of a reunion happening is slim, and says that he personally is not interested in taking part.When asked by Classic Rock's Dave Ling to clarify the rumours and the reunion's yo-yo-ing likelihood (WVH previously said he didn't ""see it happening"" but later machinations were detailed involving the guitarist in the press, suggesting that he was going to be involved) he replies: ""I think I already did it with the Taylor Hawkins tributes. I feel a lot of closure because my part of the show was a tribute to my father.""

Across the two shows, in London and Los Angeles, Wolfgang VH played three Van Halen classics - On Fire, Hot For Teacher and Panama - alongside Dave Grohl on bass, Josh Freese on drums and The Darkness’s Justin Hawkins on vocals.In Classic Rock, Wolfgang goes on to say that the Van Halen camp is ""dysfunctional"", and therefore difficult to organise any large projects with.""When it comes to Van Halen and entities surrounding the band it’s unfortunate, certainly compared to Foo Fighters who have their shit together with inter-personal relationships"" he says.""I don’t know what it is with some bands but certain personalities just can’t get over themselves to work collectively for one purpose – that’s been the curse of Van Halen for its entire career. So my playing at the Taylor shows delivered that catharsis without the stresses of dealing with the Van Halen camp, and the players involved. Their camp is very dysfunctional – everyone! – hell, it was difficult to make plans even when the band was active.""Dave Ling also asks Wolfgang about Hagar's recent comments in the aforementioned Rolling Stone interview, in which he admits that he'd ""love to play those songs again”. ""He said that, but he also said he wouldn’t"" says Van Halen.

Kiss frontman Paul Stanley offers advice on the importance of setting attainable goals;"While it's important to set big goals and never give up working for that dream job, Paul Stanley is here to offer up a helpful serving of realism in being practical about what is actually possible for you to achieve.In a new interview with Big Rig of the West Palm Beach, Florida's 98.7 The Gator radio station, the Kiss vocalist/guitarist suggested that sometimes, thinking with a rational mind as to what's truly attainable in terms of your career is better than getting lost aiming for the stars. As transcribed by Blabbermouth, Kiss' frontman says: ""In this case, what I can do, you might not be able to do in 10 years or in a hundred years. And vice versa — there's things that I'm just not equipped to do. If I had decided to pursue becoming a mathematician, I'd be homeless.""""I think at some point, each one of us has to do some sort of self-assessment — brutally honest — of what we are capable of and what's out of reach,"" he continues. ""And if you choose to pursue something that's out of reach, you're an idiot.""Speaking of why it's vital we spend our time carefully and not waste hours spent on an unrealistic goal, he adds: ""As far as I know, we have one time on this earth, and time is precious. It only becomes more precious as time goes on. So I think it's always important to chase something that's realistic. It doesn't have to be realistic for the person next to you, but you have to believe that you can do it.""Stanley, who managed to secure one of the more ""unrealistic"" jobs on the planet, globe-straddling rock 'n' roll icon, says he never once saw his own dream as unreachable. 
He explains, ""I still remember being in high school, and I certainly don't advocate someone else doing this, but I remember one of my teachers saying to me, 'Why aren't you doing the work?' And I said, 'Well, I'm gonna be a rock star.' And they said, 'Everybody wants to be a rock star.' And I said, 'Yeah, but I'm going to be'.""So you can either delude yourself, which is insanity, or you can give the full-court press to what you believe you're capable of doing,"" Stanley added.

For Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, a run in with one true titan of modern music unfolded a little differently.During a guest appearance on Sirus XM's Beatles channel in 2017, the grunge vocalist fondly remembered being punched in the face by none other than Paul McCartney.As he explains however, it wasn't an intentional act of violence, per se. It appears that, while hanging out in a Seattle hotel with the former Beatle, Vedder was accidentally struck when listening in on the star's story about hitting another man. As McCartney was explaining how he hit the person, he acted out the moment with his arms, and as Vedder was standing just a little too close, he got an accidental blow during the music legend's dramatic re-enactment. ""I was fortunate enough to be with Paul McCartney in the corner of a Seattle hotel bar"" recalls Vedder, ""and he kind of was illustrating how he hit this guy. And when he did that he kind of shot out his left arm as if he was hitting this guy and I was standing there, and I got hit. He hit me! He didn't quite pull back the punch you see...""It was a great, incredible personal story. I caught the end of it, and as I was listening, I thought, 'Paul McCartney just hit me in the face, and it hurt.'""I think I remember tasting a bit of blood, he got me right on the side of [the face]. And he apologised quickly so it wouldn't get in the way of the story.""On how he felt about being walloped by the ex-Beatle, the singer continues, ""It was a great time in my life actually, to be hit by Paul McCartney. And I remember it hurt for a few days, and I remember when it went away when the pain subsided, and the swelling went down, I kind of missed it.""Vedder has long been a fan of The Beatles, which probably helped ease the pain. In fact, Pearl Jam's leader has covered the Fab Four on a number occasions, as evident in the compilation video below, where he tackles songs such as I've Just Seen A Face, Blackbird, Rain and more.On September 8 this year, the musician performed The Beatles' 1969 song Her Majesty during a show at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, who died that same day.Vedder collaborated with a Beatle for his 2022 solo album Earthling, released in February, recruiting drummer Ringo Starr to guest appear on Mrs Mills.";2022-11-04;https://www.loudersound.com/news/pearl-jams-eddie-vedder-was-once-punched-in-the-face-by-paul-mccartney-and-kinda-liked-it;2022-11-10;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDPEARLJAM'SEDDIEVEDDERWASONCEPUNCHEDINTHEFACEBYPAULMCCARTNEY,ANDKINDALIKEDIT

In 2015, freed Guantanamo Bay detention centre prisoner Shaker Aamer revealed how his captors had played Here I Go Again as part of a noise torture tactic which involved playing loud music and white noise.

Downing officially left Judas Priest on April 20, 2011, telling fans he was stepping away from the British metal legends due to “an on-going breakdown in working relationships between myself, elements of the band and management for some time.” Since Downing returned to the spotlight with his current band, KK’s Priest, rarely a week has gone by without him offering his thoughts on the band he quit after 41 years.

“I never wanted to get into a public argument after KK left,” Tipton tells Guitar World in a new interview. “I never said a word and I stuck to my guns for over 10 years, but there comes a point when you read things that have been said that are just crazy. It's time to say something, really because he's saying things that he really shouldn't be saying. They aren't fair.”“He's insinuated that he was the driving force of the band,” he continues. “It just isn't true. Priest [is] made up of five guys working together. [There's] not just one person driving the band. He's said all these things that, I think, are meant to upset us and get us to say something in response and for a long time we didn't. But I've got a lot to say and enough's enough.”One matter which Tipton was keen to address was an accusation Downing levelled against him in a December 2021 interview with Guitar World, where he claimed that Tipton's drinking before shows and in between songs was “slowing [Priest] down”.In Tipton's new Guitar World interview, he brands these claims as “silly”. 

“Everyone knows it's not true,” he says. “Like I said, the fans aren't stupid and they've seen me for 50 years playing around the world. I may have had a couple of beers onstage, but that's all. It's never affected the concert or my performance whatsoever and he knows that.”

“I would never have talked about Ken that way,” he continues. “It’s just that his accusations have gotten sillier and sillier – and I deserve to respond. He left the band. We couldn’t convince him to stay. And then he accused me of taking six years off to write two solo albums. I only did the solo albums because we were inactive at the time while Rob was doing his solo things.”

Read the full interview with Glenn Tipton in the new issue of Guitar World.Downing's replacement, Richie Faulkner, recently called on his bandmates and their former friend to end their ""shit show"" feud.

“That whole situation with him and the band over the last 10 years, to me, has been totally unnecessary,” says Faulkner, who replaced Downing in 2011. “It's been a bit of a shit show. And I don't know why that is. To me, music aside, they should maybe pick up the phone and just talk to each other as buddies and go and have a beer and just be pals. You know, fuck music for a minute; let's just be pals. And then whatever happens, happens. They were pals for 40 years. They lived pretty much together for 40 years — four decades!”";2022-02-22;https://www.loudersound.com/news/judas-priests-glenn-tipton-hits-out-at-kk-downing-over-crazy-accusations;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERSOUNDJUDASPRIEST'SGLENNTIPTONHITSOUTATKKDOWNINGOVER""CRAZY""ACCUSATIONS"

According to the band, the song “deals with with transience, our mortality and the precious, fleeting happiness of the perfect moment.”The English translation of one of the songs key lyrics runs as follows: “Time, please stand still, stand still/Time, this should always go on so/Time, it’s so beautiful, so beautiful/Anyone knows the perfect moment.”The single, released on 10” gatefold  black vinyl and CD digipack as well as digitally, also features two alternate versions of Zeit. One is a “meditative, atmospheric neoclassical arrangement” by Icelandic musician Ólafur Arnalds, while the other is a remix by electronic/pop producer Robot Koch.The track is taken from the German band’s eighth album, also titled Zeit. The follow-up to 2019’s untitled album features 11 tracks, including the single. It was recorded at La Fabrique Studios in St. Rémy de Provence, France with producer Olsen Involtini.The album will be released on April 29 on multiple formats, including standard CD, special edition six-panel CD digipack with 56-page booklet and double vinyl 180g LP with 20-page large format booklet.

louder;Rob Halford reveals the cheeky prank Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler played on him when he fronted Black Sabbath;Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford famously fronted Black Sabbath for two shows in November 1992;"Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has opened up on the famous moment he ended up fronting Black Sabbath for two shows in 1992, in an exclusive new interview with Metal Hammer. Taking place at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, California, that November, the shows were put together as support slots for original Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, who was wrapping up his first attempt at a final tour with a big trek titled, fittingly, No More Tours.Sabbath's involvement in the shows were designed to include a reunion with Ozzy for a few songs, but there was strong resistance from then-Sabbath frontman Ronnie James Dio, who resented the idea of playing second fiddle to the Prince Of Darkness after he had so successfully blazed his own trail with the Brummie legends.Ultimately, Dio would refuse to play the shows - leading to Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi picking up the phone and calling a fellow Brummie legend for a favour.“Sabbath had Ronnie [James Dio] in at the time,"" explains Halford today. ""Sharon wanted to bring Ozzy on stage with Sabbath at the Costa Mesa arena, which is like the O2 with the roof off, sits about 20000 people. We’d just come off-stage at some other show and the phone rings and it's Tony [Iommi], he asks if I can help – ‘Sharon wants Ozzy to come in and do some work with us in a few days time and Ronnie isn’t very pleased. He doesn’t want to do it, so we talked with him and he’s asked if you wouldn’t mind stepping in and helping us out?’. ‘Well… yeah’. Brummies, you know – whatever you need. He sent me the setlist and I got all my albums out and started listening to them, not that I had to listen to them anyway because it’s always in my head.""A longtime admirer of the band, Halford decided to take the opportunity to lightly nudge Iommi to change-up Sabbath's setlist, grasping the chance to make an already special event even more unique.""He calls me back a couple days later and I’m like, ‘Tony, would you consider doing a couple of songs you might not have done for a while?’ and he’s up for it,"" Halford says. ""So we got so do stuff like NIB and closed with Forever, because there were a few tracks that hadn’t seen the light of day in a good while.  On the way to California, I rented a little studio for us in Phoenix, came in and everybody was already set up. We ran through the set once and then it was off to California. I’d gone to do one show, but it ended up being two. Not that I minded – we’re mates, and mates help each other out.""As it turns out, Halford being the 'new guy' in the band didn't stop his new Sabbath bandmates having a little fun with him - quite the opposite, in fact.""There’s another thing that mates do to each other as well – Tony and Geezer [Butler] are notorious pranksters,"" Halford reveals. ""We’re getting ready to go on and they say ‘are you nervous Rob?’ and I’m like, you’ve got to be. So I’m there, with all my gear on, looking like Pinhead from Hellraiser and I walk down to the backstage with Tony and as we get to the curtain, I realise he’s vanished. So I’m there, calling his name, ‘Tony? Tony?’ and he’s disappeared. ""I think ‘he must have gone out’, so I thought I’d better get out there too. I slowly walk out by myself and the crowd starts roaring, and I'm looking around, there's nobody on-stage. So I’m thinking ‘I’ve walked out, I can’t just walk back off’ and having this dilemma, then a few seconds later Tony and Geezer come walking out, falling about the place laughing. They’re always pulling stunts – you’ve really got to watch them. Afterwards, I asked ‘did you do that to me?’ and Geezer goes ‘you’ll never know…’ But what a brilliant show. If you look on YouTube, you can actually find a fan-shot performance. So there you go - flash forward a few decades I stood in for Ozzy again when his voice gave out. It’s a Brummy thing – we help each other out.”While the show with Halford has gone down in heavy metal history, it'd prove to be a last straw of sorts for Dio, who would exit the Sabbath fold by the end of the year, eventually reuniting with Iommi, Butler and Vinnie Appice under the banner Heaven & Hell in 2006.Read more from our exclusive interview with Rob Halford in the next issue of Metal Hammer.";2022-07-01;https://www.loudersound.com/news/rob-halford-reveals-the-cheeky-prank-tony-iommi-and-geezer-butler-played-on-him-when-he-fronted-black-sabbath;2022-07-03;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDROBHALFORDREVEALSTHECHEEKYPRANKTONYIOMMIANDGEEZERBUTLERPLAYEDONHIMWHENHEFRONTEDBLACKSABBATH

Others, not so much. But either way, it's clear the general consensus is that Dave Grohl is considered a legend by drummers far and wide.As well as versions by working drummers like Leah Bluestein and drum instructor Brandon Toews, the TikTok craze has been attempted by amateur musicians and amateur comedians alike.There's even a version performed by a dude sitting on a bucket in a bathtub, wearing a rubber horse head. Because....TikTok.According to a recent report by MetalSucks, Eagles Of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes, who is a dear pal of Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, let slip the news that a new Queens album is already finished, confirming during an Instagram Live session that he had been working on a new Eagles album and that a new Queens Of The Stone Age album was also on the way, stating that ""Queens just did one.""Interestingly, back in 2019 ZZ Top legend Billy Gibbons suggested to Eonmusic that Dave Grohl would feature on the new Queens record, which may now be a lot closer to release that many of us believed.

The set of 12 stamps feature a mix of live shots from throughout the band's career, as well as four illustrations starring band mascot Eddie the Head. The live shots range from a Bruce Dickinson image captured at London's Hammersmith Odeon during the World Piece tour in 1983, to a pair of photos from 2018's Legacy Of The Beast tour. Meanwhile, the four Eddie stamps picture metal's favourite mascot as he appeared on the artwork for the band's debut album and on their most recent - 2021's Senjutsu - as well as on the single sleeves for The Trooper and Aces High.Iron Maiden are only the fifth band to feature on a range of Royal Mail stamps, and follow in the philatelic footsteps of The Beatles in 2007, Pink Floyd in 2016, Queen in 2020, and the Rolling Stones earlier this year.The stamps, which were designed in conjunction with the band and their management company Phantom Music, are amongst the last to feature the effigy of the late Queen Elizabeth II, and are available to pre-order from the Royal Mail now (opens in new tab). The stamps go on general sale from January 12, with a Presentation Pack containing all 12 stamps priced at £17.70.""We were all absolutely astounded – in a good way ! – when we heard first about the commemorative project, and equally pretty much speechless when we saw the stamps for the very first time,"" says Maiden founder Steve Harris. ""They look superb and I think they really capture the essence and energy of Maiden. We’re all very proud that the Royal Mail has chosen to honour the band’s legacy like this and we know our fans will feel the same way.""(Image credit: Royal Mail/Phantom Music Management)""When I was younger I was a bit of a geeky stamp collector,"" Harris tells Classic Rock in a rare, exclusive interview (expect more soon!) ""At ten or eleven I was really into the whole thing for a couple of years. So having us on stamps is quite a thing for me, really.""I was as serious as you could be at that age, with a lack of funds. When I lived in Leyton there was a stamp shop there and I’d go and look in the windows at the ones I couldn’t afford. Occasionally I’d go: ‘Oh, I’ve got to have that’. The album became pretty full but I never got a Penny Black, put it that way [laughs]. ""I used to take the mick out of Bruce for being a train spotter, but collecting stamps is probably even worse – or better, depending on how you look at it. In the end I grew out of it and got into football and girls.""""As a band who have never played by anyone else’s rules for over 40 years it’s very gratifying to see them honoured in their home country in this way,"" adds band manager Rod Smallwood. ""We’re proud to show how these six band members are still appealing to more and more fans every year with their music and their legendary shows which I think these stamps really capture well. ""It’s also fantastic that Eddie has been honoured too – it’s incredible to think that Her Majesty, may she rest in peace, saw these and lent her iconic silhouette to them too.""Navigate through the live shot stamps in the gallery below using the left and right arrows.

Whether you want to continue down a path of chaos, or make a change in your course. It’s showing you what is possible when you make the decisions that bring a sort of cradled warmth into your future.

""The idea of Ethel is that you can have what you truly desire if you put to rest those short-lived fixes that never bring you any real happiness.""The arty video for the single was directed by Maxim Kelly (black midi, Black Country, New Road).

Talking about the making of the video, Kelly says: “Initially I thought Ethel should be the main character and do the dance at the end, and I always had this image from this French film called My American Uncle. Where it’s like a little girl standing up at a table. I originally had that image in my head for a rap video, but it didn’t really make sense to the song, I wanted this to feel more like surreal so then as I started finding more imagery, it kind of transpired that maybe the maid was the more interesting character.” ]Watch the video below:The Murder Capital will embark on a UK/Irish tour in February:Feb 16: Albert Hall, Manchester

Yesterday, (July 31), the frontwoman took to social media to share the criticism she received rom ""internet bros"" over the band's brief break. As per a Stereogum report, Williams shared a screenshot of one tweet she received on Instagram, in which showed a person arguing that the bandmembers of Metallica and Iron Maiden still “manage” to tour, “all of which are much older than you love.”In response, she hit back: “Neither James [Hetfield] NOR Bruce [Dickinson] are gonna suck your dick for this, LOVE.”Another commenter compares the situation to Dave Grohl falling off the stage in 2015 and says: ""Hayley Williams gets sick and cancel multiple gigs and bitches about how hard it is at 34...Dave fucking Grohl, falls off stage, breaks his leg, and returns to finish set in wheel chair at 50 odd years of age....she's a whiney hypocrite c**t"".Clapping back to the sexist tweet, she states: ""I have a lung infection you soft shit! Not a broken limb. One you can sing with for 2 hours, another you can't. But worry not! The shows weren’t cancelled, merely postponed a week. Maybe you should come out to one of them…like Dave did.""Elaborating on the criticism in a longer statement, Williams adds: ""Internet bros have been pressed by my proximity to rock music and all its subgenres since 2005. The only thing that's changed is the platform from which they spew their ignorance.""Don’t think for a second your fav bands – metal or punk or otherwise – endorse your weird incel ass lifestyle.""So many of these bands have stood side stage at our shows and treat us with respect. Why? Because they aren’t threatened by a strong woman front a great band in a completely diff genre of music.

louder;You can record a song with Gene Simmons at Electric Lady studios for $6000;Nothing planned for December? Kiss man Gene Simmons has a suggestion;"Last month, Kiss founder Gene Simmons offered fans the opportunity to spend a day with him at London's iconic Abbey Road Studio this July. For just £5000, purchasers will be able to record a song with the God Of Thunder himself, enjoy stories from Simmons' long career with the band, and leave for home with collectables from Gene's very own archive.Now he's offering American fans the same opportunity. For the princely sum of $6000, lucky ticket holders (plus their guests) will spend the day with Gene at Electric Lady studios in New York, scene of Kiss's very first recording session, way back in 1972. And the opportunity will come in the immediate aftermath of Kiss's final ever shows. ""Everybody knows December 1st and 2nd New York City, Madison Square Garden,"" says Simmons, in a video announcement. ""The last shows Kiss will ever play. But we're going to be in New York so I want to do something special for you. ""Why not do something astonishing? So December 4, 5 and 6 I'm taking over Electric Lady Studios, where we began our life, and I'm going to record a song. I want you to join me, doing lyrics, singing along with me on choruses. We'll have food, a lot of fun, and I'll give you stuff from my private collection that spans 50 years. ""You'll get all kinds of toys, games, lyrics, artwork, all kinds of stuff nobody else has, for you, from me, to you.""Gene emphasises that no musical experience is necessary to take part in the historic session, but that invitees can bring along an instrument to play on the recording. For further information, visit the Gene Simmons Electric Lady Studios website (opens in new tab).";2023-03-20;https://www.loudersound.com/news/you-can-record-a-song-with-gene-simmons-at-electric-lady-studios-for-dollar6000;2023-03-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERYOUCANRECORDASONGWITHGENESIMMONSATELECTRICLADYSTUDIOSFOR$6000

Sometimes I feel like a poser when I try to tap into faith. That small voice going, “you really don’t believe”, “you know it’s not going to be any different”… and on and on.""I brought my mentor and dear friend, James Hall, in to co-write. He was able to bring more light to that feeling of hopelessness that we all feel. What’s important is coming together to be “less not okay” and riding out the storm. The answering of prayers can be very subtle, we just have to keep our minds open to the possibility of things changing and working themselves out.""Elaborating on the accompanying visual, she adds: ""We tapped into this further with the music video. We also had the honour of working with Gilbert Trejo. He immediately picked up on the sentiment of the song and wanted to show us floating through Hollywood, going through it. The band is depicted as eventually finding one another and carrying on along the walk of fame. Definitely deep rock n’ roll poetry.""Discussing the upcoming album, Starbenders declare in a statement: ""Take Back The Night was born in the wake of the band’s most challenging obstacles to date. From life threatening necrotising bacterial pneumonia to addiction to two years of the world in limbo, it felt like the punches kept coming and coming. ""The band made a conscious decision that they were going to practice radical acceptance and stick together no matter what. The frustration and worries we choked down on the daily were transmuted into the compositions and sounds of the new record. All the triumph over serious obstacles made the rocket fuel that propelled their most cohesive and aggressive record ever.""In October, the foursome will jump the pond and head over to the UK for a headline tour.Listen to We're Not Okay and view tour dates below:Oct 09: Wolverhampton KK’s Steelmill

The new album, which was announced in January, will arrive on October 20, and is preceded by a single, Sweet Life.“It’s the most old-school Rival Sons song on either of these two records,"" says frontman Jay Buchanan. ""It has all of the early elements of what Rival Sons is and was. It was born out of my love mid-sixties rock like The Animals, The Kinks, and the bands I was raised on. It’s a bit of a break from all of the heavy subject matter too; it’s a barnburner.”Lightbringer was recorded during the same 2021 sessions as Darkfighter, with longtime producer Dave Cobb. ""It started out as one album, and the collection grew too large,” Buchanan told Classic Rock, “so we had to split it because the mass was going to be too large. So we needed to partition the collection for there to be a short refractory period between the two.""Rival Sons Are currently on tour in The US with Smashing Pumpkins, and head to Europe in October.

louder;Audiophile label MoFi to cough up $25 million to settle fraud lawsuit;"40,000 record buyers will be compensated after audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab admitted misleading customers over ""all analogue"" releases that weren't";"Audiophile record label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab will pay 40,000 consumers a total of $25 million to settle a class action lawsuit launched last August. The label, commonly known as MoFi, stood accused of using digital processes during the manufacture of its ""all analogue"" album releases.    The scandal – known as MoFi-gate – broke last summer when Phoenix record store owner Mike Esposito uploaded two videos to YouTube accusing the company of using digital masters in their ""all-analog"" and ""triple analog"" records. MoFi subsequently issued an apology for using unclear language and betraying their customers' trust, but two customers filed a class action lawsuit in Washington, alleging that MoFi's analogue branding was deceptive and resulted in them paying inflated prices. In January, MoFi – who describe themselves as ""the undisputed leader in audiophile recordings since 1977"" – elected to settle the case, but the amount of the settlement was disputed by some consumers, who argued it had been reached through a “reverse auction” in which MoFi argued with ""ineffectual"" lawyers to find the cheapest possible settlement. Now a federal judge has approved the $25 million payout, which will allow customers to either receive a full refund, or keep their albums and receive a 5% cash refund, or 10% of the money they'd spent in credit to spend on future MoFi purchases. “We appreciate the court’s ruling, which supports all of our claims that there was no reverse auction or collusion,"" MoFi's lead counsel Joseph J. Madonia tells Billboard (opens in new tab). ""As always, MoFi continues its commitment to provide the best-sounding records possible.”MoFi's upcoming releases include the six David Lee Roth-era Van Halen albums, which will be released as 45rpm double vinyl sets retailing at $125 each.";2023-05-12;https://www.loudersound.com/news/audiophile-label-mofi-to-cough-up-dollar25-million-to-settle-fraud-lawsuit;2023-05-17;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERAUDIOPHILELABELMOFITOCOUGHUP$25MILLIONTOSETTLEFRAUDLAWSUIT

louder;Watch this jazz drummer absolutely nail Tool's Schism without having ever heard it before;Legendary former Parliament/Funkadelic drummer Dennis Chambers plays a jazz-funk improv of Tool's Schism;"Tool's Danny Carey is one of metal's all-time greatest drummers, a percussive powerhouse whose mesmeric beats and unusual time signatures have helped shape prog metal. But what happens when you move away from metal and introduce Tool's music to musicians from another genre? Online drum lesson platform Drumeo wondered just that, drafting in legendary jazz/funk drummer Dennis Chambers to get his take on Carey's idiosyncratic style. And, as you might expect when one legend takes on another, the results are pretty stellar. Though Chambers admits to some misgivings in the beginning - ""I got a problem with this, this is not my type of thing,"" he admits early on - he quickly gets into the mood for it, offering his own one-take improv over the track. Even with a disclaimer that Schism ""isn't [his] cuppa tea"" and having only heard the song once, Chambers is quick to break down its components, from the odd time signatures to the overall tonal approach of the song. Naturally, Chambers' own take leans heavily on his background. A member of Parliament/Funkadelic from 1978 to 1985, he has since played with many of the world's most renowned jazz fusion musicians, a factor which clearly shines through during his performance. Despite only hearing the song once, Chambers' performance fits incredibly well. He even qualifies towards the end that he recognises that ""some figures were going down"", forcing him to step up his improv as he has no isolated tracks to work from. Although Chambers initially attests that the song isn't for him, it seems by the end he's a convert, calling Schism a ""great song"" and asking which album it hails from. Considering Carey's love for dual-drum jams, maybe a team-up could be on the cards in future.

And what did the couple do to celebrate? Did they perhaps pop a bottle of expensive bubbly? Facetime their friends and fam to share the good news? Nah. Excessively extra and cringe beings that they are, the couple shared in a glass of each other's blood to mark the special occasion. Well, that's what the kids – er, sorry – thirty year olds are doing these days.As if their tell-all stories with big time publications weren't enough to prove their all-consuming love to the world, they've taken to social media to describe the moment where they agreed that they'd someday be man and wife, or weed and wife, if you fancy. MGK, who has promised to release two new albums this year, shared an image of Fox's engagement ring formed of the couple's birthstones, alongside the caption: ""Yes, in this life and every life. Beneath the same branches we fell in love under, I brought her back to ask her to marry me. ""I know tradition is one ring, but I designed it with Stephen Webster to be two: the emerald (her birth stone) and the diamond (my birth stone) set on two magnetic bands of thorns that draw together as two halves of the same soul forming the obscure heart that is our love.""While Fox wrote underneath a video of the proposal in action, ""In July of 2020 we sat under this banyan tree. We asked for magic. We were oblivious to the pain we would face together in such a short, frenetic period of time.

""Unaware of the work and sacrifices the relationship would require from us but intoxicated off of the love. And the karma. Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him.

""And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes"", before adding ""…and then we drank each other’s blood"".Course they did. We might sound bitter, but really, aren't we all just waiting for that special someone to sink our teeth into? No? Okay.

It will be the follow up to Alder's solo debut album, 2019's What The Water Wants.""When I first heard this song I knew that it was going to be one of my favourites on the new album,"" says Alder of the new song. ""It was dark and moody with tons of changes. It was like a huge blank canvas that I couldn’t wait to begin painting on. In the end it became one of the songs on the album that I am most proud of.""As with the What The Water Wants debut, the new album was written with guitarists Mike Abdow (Fates Warning touring member) and Tony Hernando (Lords Of Black) – who both also performed bass guitar on their own songs – and features drummer Craig Anderson (Ignite, Crescent Shield).“When we wrote the first solo album I wanted to try some different musical styles,"" Alder adds. ""I didn’t want it to be really heavy, but more musical with catchy choruses. I think we did a pretty good job on that first one.""But with this new album I wanted the music and lyrics to be darker and heavier. I think Mike did a fantastic job with the music. He listened to what I was saying and thinking musically. Tony knows that I like the big choruses and somewhat traditional sound. And of course Craig did an amazing job on the drums as usual.

louder;Watch this witty genius create his own Slipknot song using a lyric generator and some serious guitar skills;Steve Terreberry sports an electrician's boiler suit and an array of weird masks to write his own Slipknot song... then films an epic music video for it;"Remember that clever chap who pretended to be each member of Metallica in a hilariously clever skit? Well, that very same smart ass, Steve Terreberry, has also created his own parody of Slipknot, titled How To Be Slipknot, and it's both seriously brilliant, and admirably bat-shit.At the beginning of the video, the self-proclaimed 'Djent God/guitar shredder/triangle officianado' ""steals"" his electrician's boiler suit, which he accessorises with a strange, toothy visor.   Wardrobe choices made, he starts to write his very own Slipknot song, commencing with a drop-tuned guitar riff. But after hammering out an impressive hook, he decides that he doesn't actually want it to sound too ""catchy"", or like a metalcore song, before coining the quip ""metalCOREY Taylor"". His main goal for the guitar part is to sound ""creepy"", an element which he describes as being in all ""signature Slipknot songs"".Following the introductory riff, he swaps out his mask for a plague doctor visor (which he continually sucks into his face like a hilarious buffoon), and tackles the guitar part for the verse. After another visage change - this time, a pigeon head - he tries his best to mimic the sound of late Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison via a drum machine.Possibly the most amusing part of his recreation however is his attempt to copy frontman Corey Taylor's vocals, after creating lyrics from a lyric generator an array of prompted words such as ""devil"", ""shit"" and ""disease"".""So a trademark of Corey Taylor's vocals is switching between ANGRY!! and clean singing"" he explains helpfully, demonstrating exactly what he means with comical enthusiasm. Trust us, this part you won't want to miss.Having nailed the song, Terreberry then goes all in, and films his own Slipknot-inspired video. And honestly, if someone was to tell us this was an official release by the Iowan metal heavyweights, we'd believe them.

But the 1983 release – their only one with Ian Gillan – also marked the point at which Sabbath began to spin into the wilderness.“Some of the songs on there are great,” bassist Butler insisted during a recent appearance on the Eddie Trunk Show (via Metal Injection). “I thought the band sounded great. I mean, we're playing great on there. I thought Gillan was singing better than ever.”He listed Zero The Hero, Trashed and the title track as songs containing “some great riffs” and continued: “It was great doing the album – but somehow the mix didn’t get done right. I thought the mix wasn’t great on it, but I listened to it about six months ago, I thought it was a really good album.”Last year Tony Iommi told Trunk that his long search for the Born Again master tapes had been successful. “They discovered where they were in some library in some record company somewhere. Obviously, I'd love to do that – I'd love to get that one sounding right.“I think that was a really good album. And when we’d first done it in the studio, it sounded great. But when it came out on record, it was really muffly and not good. So I want to try and do something with that.”;2022-06-08;https://www.loudersound.com/news/geezer-butler-has-defended-one-of-black-sabbaths-most-maligned-albums;2022-06-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDGEEZERBUTLERHASDEFENDEDONEOFBLACKSABBATH'SMOSTMALIGNEDALBUMS

The record opened up a whole different approach to the way we created our music. ""It was the beginning of a way of writing – a kind of controlled improvisation. Because of this shift, the record was to some extent divisive – but it was the necessary reinvention that the Bad Seeds desperately needed.“For that reason Push The Sky Away continues to stand as one of my most loved of all the Bad Seeds' albums"".At the time, The Bad Seeds was comprised of Nick Cave, Warren Ellis, Jim Sclavunos, Martyn Casey, Thomas Wydler and Conway Savage, with Barry Adamson and George Vjestica each joining for two tracks.Check out the videos and view the setlist below:Push The Sky Away set list at Fonda Theatre1.

Other musicians targeted include dance music acts Daft Punk, David Guetta, and Tiesto.According to the report, the troll factory is based at the Arsenal Machine-building Factory in St. Petersburg, a site that manufactures military equipment and technology. Evidence of the disinformation was found across social media – on Twitter, Facebook Instagram, YouTube and TikTok – with pro-Moscow messages from legitimate social media users amplified in order to evade measures put in place to combat disinformation.The Guardian reports that the operation has been linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch with close ties to Russian president Vadimir Putin. Prigozhin is the founder of the Internet Research Agency, a group accused interfering with the US presidential election in 2016, and is on the FBI's wanted list.UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin’s illegal war.“The UK government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.”In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Rammstein issued a statement, saying ""The band Rammstein wishes to express its support for the nation of Ukraine as it resists the shocking attack perpetrated by the Russian government. Above all at this moment, we feel particular grief for the suffering of the Ukrainian people.“Each member of the band has various experiences of the two countries; all members of the band have friends, associates, partners, fans in both lands.

As with anything Metallica related, however, there are still some cynics out there who remain unimpressed with the band's modern output.One of these naysayers includes YouTuber Bradley Hall, the internet personality who creates metal comedy videos about how bands sound to people that hate them, including videos dedicated to Muse and Kiss.On top of his penchant for comedy, he's also a seriously talented guitarist. After declaring that he found Kirk Hammett's solo on Lux Æterna ""underwhelming"", Hall has decided to work his guitar-playing chops for a full reworking of the solo, completely rewriting it into something new.Although we have to disagree with Hall's take on the song itself – we think Hammett's solo is great– this new interpretation has sent our jaws to floor.

She will be undergoing surgery to remove the tumour tomorrow and also states she is hopeful of making the start of Nightwish's upcoming European tour, which kicks off on November 20 in Antwerp.The full statement reads: ""A letter to you. Life comes in waves, with ups and downs.""I have had the joy of riding many highs, and I have shared these with you through social media and the many many shows worldwide throughout the many years of my career.""But now a new wave hit me. Not a good one. I have breast cancer. It was diagnosed a little over 2 weeks ago and I will have surgery tomorrow to remove the tumour. My prognosis is very good!!! It seems to be a non-aggressive cancer, which seems to not have spread. I will keep my breast. And I will be cancer free after this surgery, plus a local radiation treatment that will take place three months after this surgery, hopefully. We will know more after the surgery to see if this positive prognosis stands.""The word cancer is a shocker. All that you found important in life before this diagnosis changes radically within minutes. Now I just want to be healthy again. I want to see my daughter grow into a woman; I want to live! And the scariest part of this diagnosis is that I thought I was healthy! I didn’t feel the cancer, I didn’t know it was there until I, as a 40+ woman, went to a standard mammogram checkup. Something many countries offer, for free even for the lucky ones.""Had I not gone there, the tumour would have gone undetected. In a year from now this could have grown much bigger. The thought of that makes me share this story with you. A mammogram is lifesaving! It’s uncomfortable and you might think that you won’t have something in your breasts anyway but GO! And for the men reading this: remind your wife, girlfriend, mother, sister to go and get checked. Even without the luxury I as a western woman experience with free mammogram checkups: GO! Luckily, there are many organisations that offer information about self-detection if you do not have access or funds for a mammogram.""If I might inspire you to take good care of yourself, then something good will come out of this cancer diagnosis.""If all goes as planned, I will be up and running in time for the European tour with Nightwish, that will start on the 20th of November! And I am optimistic since my prognosis is good! I promise to take good care of myself.""I will be off the grid for a while to focus on myself.""Thank you for reading this letter.""Jansen had recently released three solo singles, Fire, Storm and Me Without You, which had shown a more pop-orientated sound than Nightwish's symphonic prog metal.Louder wishes Floor a speedy recovery.";2022-10-26;https://www.loudersound.com/news/floor-jansen-reveals-she-has-cancer;2022-10-27;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDNIGHTWISHSINGERFLOORJANSENREVEALSSHEHASCANCER

To prove this point, we now present a video that was supplied by none other than Iron Maiden themselves.In the video, which was uploaded to their TikTok account, a family can be seen preparing to break out into dance while Iron Maiden's 1983 classic The Trooper plays over the top. Before the parents can get fully into it though, their young, clearly very cheeky baby, nabs the phone and begins enthusiastically headbanging into the screen with a mischievous grin. The future of metal is in safe hands, people!The video has amassed over 2 million views and over 300K likes, and although we don't think the family are really dancing to the Maiden song, as it sounds like the music has been placed over the top rather than played through their own speakers, it's still brilliant all the same.

Chief among these is the decade (and a bit) absence of Rob Halford from 1992 until 2003, the band's long-time vocalist leaving after fulfilling contractual obligations to promote 1990's seminal Painkiller.Replacing the Metal God would be an enormous task at the best of times, but coming right as the tides shifted and classic heavy metal was being thrown out in favour of grunge, it certainly put the pressure on Priest. While the band would ultimately hire the excellent Tim 'Ripper' Owens in 1996, a new interview with prog metal mastermind Devin Townsend suggests we almost had a very, very different outcome. Speaking to The SDR Show hosts Ralph Sutton and James Mattern, Townsend admitted that he received an invitation to try out for the vacant vocal spot in Judas Priest. ""Technically, yes, that happened, but it's not like they were knocking down my door,"" he explains. ""They threw out a blanket thing to a bunch of singers - Warrel [Dane] from Nevermore, myself and a couple other people got this letter with the [logo].""At that point, Townsend had enjoyed some success singing with guitar maestro Steve Vai, as well as a short-lived stint with British group The Wildhearts. He would ultimately balance his time between extreme metal project Strapping Young Lad and a (characteristically) unpredictable solo career, but admits he was pretty starstruck to receive the invitation in the first place. ""[1979 Judas Priest live album] Unleashed In The East was the shit for me right, so to have that was... but I also remember thinking that singing was this thing that happened to me because of my involvement with Steve [Vai]. I learned to sing, because I was a guitar player and most of the singers I auditioned I didn't relate to."" For all of his unpredictable prog metal genius, Townsend admits he didn't think much of his chances when it came to working with a band like Judas Priest.""The technique that I had was so shoddy, that had I got into a situation with that level of expectation, to sing like Rob Halford... Dude, I'd have been crucified.""Still, in the grand scheme of the multiverse, we can't help but wonder what a universe where Priest could go from Painkiller into Oh My Fucking God would look like...Watch the full interview below.";2023-01-05;https://www.loudersound.com/news/devin-townsend-turned-down-a-chance-to-replace-rob-halford-in-judas-priest;2023-01-08;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDDEVINTOWNSENDTURNEDDOWNACHANCETOREPLACEROBHALFORDINJUDASPRIEST

Naru has to pit her skills, strength and wits against, you guessed it, a Predator - one of the first to have ever arrived on Earth - as she tried to protect her tribe against a grizzly fate.And speaking of grizzly, a gripping chase scene between Naru and a big ol' bear looks set to be just one of the nail-biting and action-packed set pieces featured in Prey, judging by the two-minute trailer which follows in the wake of the brief teaser clip we got to see last month. ""I think, on the one hand, we wanted to separate from Predator and have an experience that felt interesting and fascinating and exciting even before the Predator shows up,"" director Dan Trachtenberg (10 Cloverfield Lane) tells Screenrant.

This philosophy is carried through in the story of a bluesman, at the crossroads of the universe.""Starcatcher was recorded with Dave Cobb at his base at RCA Studios in Nashville, and finds the band exploring ""the duality of fantasy versus reality and the contrast between light and darkness.""""We had this idea that we wanted to tell these stories to build a universe,” says drummer Danny Wagner. “We wanted to introduce characters and motifs and these ideas that would come about here and there throughout our careers through this world.""""When I imagine the world of Starcatcher, I think of the cosmos,” explains bassist and keyboard player Sam Kizska. “It makes me ask a lot of questions, like ‘Where did we come from?’ or ‘What are we doing here?’ But it’s also questions like, ‘What is this consciousness that we have, and where did it come from?’”“We didn’t really have to force or be intense about writing, because everything that happened was very instinctual,” adds frontman Jake Kizska. “If anything, the record is our perspective, and sums up where we are as a group and individually as musicians.”Later this summer, Greta Van Fleet will hit the road for their Starcatcher world tour, kicking off on July 24 in Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.Listen to The Falling Sky and check out their tour dates below:Last week, GVF frontman Josh Kiszka publicly identified as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community for the first time, and aired his concerns over US politicians ""proposing bills that threaten the freedom of love.""Via a statement shared on his personal social media accounts, the singer revealed how he had been in a ""loving, same-sex relationship"" with his partner for eight years, whom he lives with in Tennessee, and noted how ""there is still work to be done for LGBTQ+ rights in TN, the nation, and the world"".Starcatcher tracklist:

It's been released as part of label Erased Tapes celebrations for Piano Day which, in case you didn't know, is on Wednesday, March 29.The new single obviously has piano at its core, sparingly embellished by melodica, glockenspiel, electronics and pedal steel guitar.""This piece came about in Italy where we’ve been staying quite a lot over the last few years,"" explains Penguin Cafe mainman Arthur Jeffes. ""Time passes differently there – with this sense of endlessly repeating days and a kind of wistfulness stemming from knowing that tomorrow will be the same as yesterday. There is a kind of peace in that, but also a feeling of time slipping through one’s hands.""One day a musical friend from further North, Alessandro ‘Asso’ Stefana (who has worked with Mike Patton, PJ Harvey and Calexico), took advantage of a break between projects to come and visit. He brought lots of pedals and a lap steel, and we just tried things out. I ended up with a fairly sparse mix, as it captures the feeling of those days most clearly.""Second Variety is the first new music from Penguin Cafe since the 10th anniversary reissue of their debut album, titled A Matter of Life… 2021. Prior to that the band released the critically acclaimed 2019 album Handfuls Of Night, which was inspired by Jeffes’ expedition where he re-created famous explorer Scott’s last Antarctic trip in 1911.(Image credit: Erased Tapes)";2023-03-26;https://www.loudersound.com/news/penguin-cafe-release-new-song-second-variety-for-piano-day;2023-03-27;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERPENGUINCAFERELEASENEWSONGSECONDVARIETYFORPIANODAY
louder;"""It was an utterly ridiculous idea"": Geezer Butler on the embarrassing truth behind Black Sabbath's infamous Stonehenge set, their unfortunate 'devil baby' and Spinal Tap";"""People often ask if I've seen the film This Is Spinal Tap. I always reply, 'Seen it? I lived it'.""";"In 1983, Black Sabbath found themselves in danger of being outflanked by not one, but two, of their former vocalists.

Having recruited Jake E. Lee as his new guitarist following the tragic passing of Randy Rhoads, Ozzy Osbourne would return in triumphant form with his third solo album Bark At The Moon, while his replacement in Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio, had bounced back from his own acrimonious split with Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler to launch his own solo band, Dio, with a brilliant debut album, Holy Diver.Sabbath's notoriously combative manager Don Arden, still smarting over his daughter Sharon's decision to manage Ozzy, wasn't a man who took kindly to his charges being pushed out of the spotlight, and having recruited former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to front a new Mk. III Sabbath line-up on their new Born Again album, Arden had a brainwave in regards to how the godfathers of metal could re-establish themselves as rock giants: they should perform live in front of giant rocks.

The concept, and its disastrous execution, is explained in excruciating detail in Geezer Butler's entertaining, recently-released new memoir Into The Void.Check out the best Prime Day deals for music fans""Presumably because we had an instrumental called Stonehenge on the album, Don wanted a Stonehenge stage set, with a massive sun rising up behind the stones as the show progressed,"" Butler writes. ""I thought it was an utterly ridiculous idea.""

The idea descended into farce from the moment that the designers of the new stage set looked at Sabbath's tour manager's plans for the production, and wrongly interpreted his measurements of the size of the rocks as pertaining to metres rather than feet. As a consequence, the stage props which were delivered to Sabbath were three times larger than they were supposed to be.

""When we rehearsed at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, the stones were set up on the floor and actually looked really expressive,"" Butler recalls, noting that the idea of the 'rising sun' was abandoned due to the costs involved. ""But when we did our first gig of the tour in Norway, and out the stones on the stage, they were almost touching the ceiling.

""That's when Don had another brainwave: 'We'll have a midget crawling on top of them, dressed as the baby devil on the album cover'... At our gig in Canada, this little bloke, who was dressed in a red leotard with long yellow fingernails and horns stuck to his head, was crawling across the top of the tallest stone and fell off. That was actually supposed to happen, but someone had removed the mattress, and the poor fella injured himself quite badly. That was the end of the devil baby.""At this point, you may well be noting some similarities with a pivotal scene in 'mockumentary' This Is Spinal Tap where the British hard rock legends commission as Stonehenge stage set, only to receive a miniature set of stones when the designers confuse ""feet"" with ""inches"" on the scale drawings.  Geezer Butler is not blind to this.""Years later we did a photo shoot with Spinal Tap and asked them if they'd based those scenes on us, but they said it was just coincidence,"" he writes. ""I find that difficult to believe.

""People often ask if I've seen the film... I always reply, 'Seen it? I've lived it.' I know Iron Maiden hated that film, thought it was an affront, but it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen, because it's so accurate.""

louder;Listen closely to Nickelback's Dimebag Darrell tribute, Side Of A Bullet, and you'll hear a previously unreleased solo from the late Pantera guitarist;Nickelback were gifted a bunch of unreleased Dimebag Darrell guitar soloes for potential use in their emotional tribute to the late Pantera legend;"There's not many bands out there who will come out and declare their kinship for Nickelback, aka the rock superstars that everyone loves to hate. But, back in the day, the Abbot brothers were pretty close friends with the Canadian hard rock band, so much so that they even collaborated on a track with Chad Kroeger's men.As reported by our friends at Guitar World, it turns out that a guitar solo by the late Dimebag Darrell was incorporated into Nickelback's ferocious, hard-hitting Side Of A Bullet, written as a salute to the influential guitarist, who was shot and killed on-stage in 2004 by an obsessed fan. The track features on the Canadian group's best-selling fifth studio album For All The Right Reasons, and was written from the lyrical perspective of a Pantera fan seeking revenge for Dimebag's death.Apparently, back in the day, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger played the track to Dimebag's brother, Vinnie Paul, and even asked the Pantera drummer to redo the drum parts. Vinnie Paul declined said offer, and instead suggested that they use some of Dimebag's unused material to embellish the track.After receiving permission from the late guitarist's girlfriend Rita Haney, Abbott sent Nickelback several solo outtakes from Pantera's classic albums Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven.“A lot of people didn’t like the fact that they were friends with us,"" acknowledged bassist Mike Kroeger in a past interview, or fans of our music. But the metal world can be a little intense to its own, y’know? 

“The guy was a legend, as well as his brother – that whole band was,” he added.""So it was just really cool that they didn’t care about that, and they just wanted to be friends with us because they liked what we did.”The members of Nickelback and Pantera first met in 2002, when they were introduced by Alice In Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell“We’d known the Pantera guys since a really early time in our career"" explains Mike. ""They were fans of ours from the beginning, and we would always see them out on the road or whenever we would go through Dallas; they would come out and ply us with alcohol.”According to Chad Kroeger, Vinnie Paul once revealed - after too many whiskeys - that he would listen to Nickelback ""every day"".“[It] really surprised me,” Kroeger admitted to MTV in 2005. “But I guess they come from that whole Southern-rock background, and we're a hard-rock band with Southern-rock influences, so they liked it a lot.”On top of his beyond-the-grave contribution to Side Of A Bullet, Dimebag also played with Nickelback on their cover of Elton John's Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, which was to be added to the Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle soundtrack, featuring Kid Rock.Listen to Side Of A Bullet below:";2022-09-15;https://www.loudersound.com/news/listen-closely-to-nickelbacks-dimebag-darrell-tribute-side-of-a-bullet-and-youll-hear-a-previously-unreleased-solo-from-the-late-pantera-guitarist;2022-09-18;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDLISTENCLOSELYTONICKELBACK'SDIMEBAGDARRELLTRIBUTE,SIDEOFABULLET,ANDYOU'LLHEARAPREVIOUSLYUNRELEASEDSOLOFROMTHELATEPANTERAGUITARIST

The rock world has already got its hands on the track, with Mobo-nominated alt-rock duo Nova Twins putting out a critically acclaimed remix just earlier this month.Vincent, however, has typically decided to take things one step further by reimagining the pop banger as a Ghost song. He's given Unholy a delightfully spooky makeover, boasting eerie, multilayered vocals, heavy, downtuned riffs and flourishes of ghoulish theatrics. The biggest surprise of all? It totally works, and we can only assume that Ghost mainman Tobias Forge approves - after all, he's already expressed a lot of love for Abba this year, so he knows his way around a great pop hook.Have a listen to Antony Vincent's Ghostly version of Unholy below.Sadly, while we reckon Tobias Forge would like the sound of the song, there's every chance he won't have heard the original track on which its based. ""I am so bad at listening to other records, other band's records, I must say,"" he admitted earlier this week to Revolver.

Paul Di'Anno exited Iron Maiden in 1981, and told Classic Rock last year, “I don’t blame them for getting rid of me.”By his own admission, as he revealed to Classic Rock’s Dave Ling, Di’Anno “didn’t know what the fuck I was doing” when Steve Harris’ band began work on their self-titled debut album with producer Will Malone in January 1980. But he recalled that the East London band felt “too much excitement to feel any pressure.”“We knew that what we had was unique compared to every other band around, and we had spent the previous couple of years playing every shithole in the UK, also some decent venues as well,” said Di’Anno. “The only person who might have had any doubts was me.

The latter reaction was largely rooted in anger over the double standards held by society in regards to the exposure of male and female bodies; Lee’s nude photo remained on Instagram for several hours, while, previously, the posting of images which included bared female nipples have seen users’ accounts come under threat of deletion by the platform, which has strict guidelines on nudity. Now Lee is suggesting that the platform's policy on the baring of flesh has driven him to start an OnlyFans account, popular for hosting curated explicit content from users.

In a video on his Instagram Stories and Twitter accounts, Lee announced, “Yo I’m Tommy Lee. Join me over at OnlyFans because I went the S@#% over there because I’m tired of Instagram policing our bodies. So head on over to the wild side on OnlyFans.”The post followed up on comments the drummer made onstage in Vegas.“I showed you my shit,"" Lee told the Las Vegas audience.

During the interview Wylde also shares his memories of his dear, departed friend, Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who was killed onstage in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 2004.

""Dime had a massive heart and just loved seeing everybody have a good time,"" says Wylde. ""He was like Santa Claus with a pink beard; I think about him all the time. First time I met Dime was at Donington when I was with Pride & Glory [in 1994]. Pantera’s set was amazing, the power they had was unbelievable, and we became buddies after that show.

I'm sorry Meg White was terrible and no band is better for having shitty percussion.""After being taken to task by much of the internet, Markay later apologised, saying ""It was an over-the-top take on TWS and White as a drummer, and was, let’s face it, just truly awful in every way. Petty, obnoxious, just plain wrong.""Yesterday Rage Against The Machine man Tom Morello added his voice to the debate, taking to Instagram to say, ""Meg White is one of the greatest drummers in the history of rock n roll. It’s not even a debate. There are a handful of drummers ever who are instantly recognisable rocking their many hit songs with flavour, fire and flair. She’s on that list, bruh.""And now drumming sensation Nandi Bushell has posted footage of herself playing along with the Glitch Mob remix of The White Stripes' classic Seven Nation Army – a performance punctuated by screams – and explained how the song inspired her own path into music. ""The first day I got drums my dad showed me the video of Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes. I saw Meg playing the drums and thought she was the coolest person in the world. I still do. ""The more I learn about music, the more I realise that songs, and art, are created to wake emotions deep inside the soul. No matter how fast my fills get or the number rudiments I learn. If I can’t write a song that moves people, then can’t call myself an artist. ""Meg and Jack White wrote some of the best songs in rock history They moved me at five years old to want to play the drums and still move me today! My screams are for you Meg! You are and always will be my role model and hero!""In the footage, Bushell's snare drum is been painted with a heart and the name 'Meg', and the clip ends by cutting to footage of a very young Bushell playing Seven Nation Army before excitedly tipping her kit over.";2023-03-22;https://www.loudersound.com/news/nandi-bushell-pays-homage-to-meg-white-with-seven-nation-army-cover-punctuated-by-screams;2023-03-22;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERNANDIBUSHELLPAYSHOMAGETOMEGWHITEWITHSEVENNATIONARMYCOVERPUNCTUATEDBYSCREAMS

The Hives have become old, wise souls trapped in young, sexy bodies. And so has their music.""Pro-shot footage of the performance can be watched below.Almqvist appeared to be showing no ill effects from last week's incident which left him with blood pouring from his head after accidentally hitting himself with his microphone.It happened in Manchester, England, where the band were opening for Arctic Monkeys at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.The Hives recently released their first new music in over a decade, along with an entertainingly far-fetched story which they hope will explain exactly why they've been out-of-action.New album, The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons, will be released on August 11, and was announced with the release of a video for new single Bogus Operandi.On what fans can expect from the album, Almqvist says: ""Who the fuck wants mature rock’n’roll? That’s always where people go wrong, I feel. ‘It’s like rock’n’roll but adult,’ nobody wants that!""That’s literally taking the good shit out of it.

""In the last few years of his life I spent a lot of time looking after him, and he used to love telling me stories from his youth. ""One was of an 11-day trek he made across British Columbia through wild rapids and snow-covered mountains. He'd documented the whole adventure along with a selection of old photographs, so I took the opportunity of converting everything into a hardback book for him using an online printing company. He was so pleased with it and I wished he'd written more of his stories down. So that inspired me to start writing mine. One story led to another and before I knew it I was writing a whole book.”West has spent nearly 30 years behind the keyboards with Threshold and co-writes most of the band's material with guitarist Karl Groom.

On the 24th [of February] at five o'clock in the morning, I was just driving and things around me started exploding. I got straight under the shelling, under the attack, and I thought, 'This is the end.' ""I was trying to get out of there, driving 180 kilometres on a very narrow road. It was still dark. And I saw things that I, before that, only saw in movies — huge explosions with all these pieces flying around. And they were falling right in front of me, and I was driving around them, and all the smoke around. It was like a real horror, but you're a part of it.""He continues, ""I was on the way back to Kyiv, and I was just trying to get home as soon as possible. And I saw all these traffic jams — people were trying to get out of the city — and all the destruction because of the first attack. And then the first week was the most horrible time because nobody knew what was happening. I got home, and one of the first things which I did, I contacted everyone in the band. We made a post on social media. And everyone stayed home.""Every half an hour, there was a siren. We went to the basement. I went to the basement alone, because I was staying alone — I took my family out. I was alone, just sitting, watching the news and going crazy. Then every half an hour, I'd go to the basement, then go up, basement, up, spend half of the night in the basement. And there [were] huge explosions all around. Things that [weren't] even close the first night — like, five kilometers, ten kilometers away from me. This is not close; in our reality, this is not close. But [because of] how massive those explosions were, the land was shaking.""The real horror started to happen, ""And this is basically when the siege of Kyiv started. And the next very day, I just felt like stating our position [publicly] and claiming our position. I made that video which is on YouTube. I wasn't able to realize things like that could happen.""Speaking of Jinjer returning to the road, he says: ""Well, it has its pros and cons. On the one hand, being onstage for this 45[-minute], 50[-minute] or one-hour [set] is the perfect therapy for me, and it's the only time I can forget about the war — just playing music and connecting with the crowd. ""Because all the other time, my mood really goes up and down constantly — it swings back and forth, back and forth. And I may feel absolutely okay at one point, but after a few minutes I'm totally depressed — depressed in the way that I can barely act. And being able to play is definitely a cure.""Watch the full interview below:

Although he did not name the plaintiff in either his memoir Does the Noise in My Head Bother You? or the official Aerosmith biography Walk This Way, Tyler shares details of a thee-year relationship with an underage girl in both books: in his memoir he states that the girl’s parents “signed a paper over for me to have custody, so I wouldn’t get arrested if I took her out of state.”

The plaintiff came forward after the State of California temporarily lifted the statute of limitations, stating that her life was “shattered” following the publication of Tyler’s autobiography, which she claims described the “abusive” courtship as ""a romantic, loving relationship"" without her knowledge. The case is filed with Torrance Superior Court.

In previously refuting the charges made against him in the lawsuit, Tyler maintains that Misley consented to the sexual relationship, and argues that her claims should be barred “because of immunity to Defendant as caretaker/guardian.”

The new claim by his lawyers asks that Misley's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim be struck off as she should not be allowed to use his memoirs against him as “The conduct complained of arises out of statements made in Tyler’s published memoirs. Such conduct implicates Tyler’s right to free speech.” The singer's legal team argue that sections of the claim citing Tyler's memoirs make it a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” (SLAPP) and are barred by the First Amendment.

“Tyler’s memoirs regarding his experiences as a world-famous rockstar are indisputably newsworthy as demonstrated by the widespread attention they have garnered,” the motion reads. “Accordingly, the depth of the intrusion is minimal and clearly outweighed by Tyler’s right to recount events from his own life in his memoirs.”

The case continues.";2023-05-03;https://www.loudersound.com/news/steven-tyler-intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress-sexual-assault-of-a-minor-lawsuit;2023-05-03;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERSTEVENTYLER'SLAWYERSWANTACLAIMOF""INTENTIONALINFLICTIONOFEMOTIONALDISTRESS""STRUCKFROMSEXUALASSAULTOFAMINORLAWSUITFILEDAGAINSTHIM"

Keeping our loose concept of spirit animals in mind, I re-read Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? (later be adapted into the 1982 film Blade Runner) knowing symbolically that animals played a key role in the story. This, along with revisiting both movies from the Blade Runner franchise, opened up some deeper philosophical topics about the nature of identity which have served as a backbone for the lyrical content.""The band have been teasing their seventh studio album over the past few weeks online, and Fauna builds on the spirit animals concept.“The premise of the album when we started writing it was that every song would have an animal assigned to it,"" Jennings continues. ""They all have something related to the animal kingdom that we could write about, but they also connect to the human world. Each track has layers, and some of them are more obvious than others.”“It reminds me of The Mountain,” adds guitarist and fellow founder Richard Henshall. “There, we had the idea of not really a narrative-based album, but more the concept of climbing a mountain and overcoming the obstacles along the way. Then we took that and thought about how it could relate to our everyday lives. All of Fauna’s animals relate to us, personally.”Fauna also marks the return of keyboard player Peter Jones, whose sounds can be heard permeating the entire album. “What Pete’s brought sonically to the band has played a massive role in why we do have a lot of new sounds on this record,” says Ross. “It’s always a new dynamic when there’s a change in personnel, and this is a fresh and reviving one. It’s certainly helped proximity-wise, with Pete being in the country: Pete and Ray [Hearne, Haken’s drummer] would be at Rich’s place and they’d just start jamming. That’s really key to how the songs start.""Fauna will be available on several formats, including Ltd 2CD (incl. instrumentals), Standard CD, Gatefold 2LP and digital album.

In his tribute, the singer suggested to his followers that they check out the introduction to Rainbow's 1976 song Stargazer, stating: ""with the incomparable Ronnie Dio on vocals & you will know why many consider it to be the greatest metal song ever!"".After one fan argued in response that Queen's Freddie Mercury should be dubbed the greatest frontman instead, this led Snider to describe Dio's stage presence (or apparently, lack of) as though he ""pretty much just stood on stage & sang"", so therefore should not be considered a great ""frontman"".  

Of Led Zeppelin's Plant, he said: ""I'm a HUGE Plant fan vocally...but he showed me nothing as a performer. Looked amazing, great hair...stood on stage with one hand raised and sang his ass off. Not a frontman in my opinion. And FYI many great frontmen are not great singers.""Now in a new interview with the Sally Steele Rocks podcast, Snider has come forward to defend his statements, which unsurprisingly, upset a lot of music fans. When asked if he ever feels regret over his tendency to make ""spur-of-the-moment"" comments, he says (as transcribed by Blabbermouth): ""No, because [those comments are] usually pretty thought out in my head. I don't really sort of just blurt things out; I process 'em and I'm kind of deliberate. I say it and it comes out like it's blurted. But I've got strong opinions.""People get very upset sometimes when me or a lot of celebrities express our feelings, like we're not allowed to have an opinion,"" he continued. ""I always say 'in my humble opinion', but trust me, that's the first thing they cut off when they repost it. 'In my humble opinion' — that's gone.""Elaborating on the frontman/performer debate, he continues: ""How do you differentiate a Dee Snider or an Alice Cooper or a Robert Plant or a Bon Scott… Or a Chris Cornell, who just stood there, but he sang perfectly every night.""So I was just trying, in a social media Twitter discussion, to explain the differences. And people were up in arms: 'How can you possibly say that Robert Plant isn't a great frontman?' And I love Robert. And I was just trying to… You can't put me and Robert Plant in the same category. So how would you explain what Dee Snider does on stage and what Robert Plant does on stage. And I was trying to do that. But people got upset.""

""I’d definitely join a supergroup,"" Gallagher states, ""I don’t know if I would start one. Who would I like to be in a supergroup with? I could be in a band with [Paul] Weller, and I could be in a band with Johnny [Marr], easily.""When it comes to choosing a rhythm section for his dream group, Gallagher goes big, nominating Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. 

“Ringo and Macca would be fucking great,"" he says. ""Imagine being in a band with Ringo and Macca. Who’s singing? Everyone. I’d fucking pay to be in it.""

Gallagher ends his fantasy sequence by saying, ""Get me [promoter] Harvey ­Goldsmith.""Gallagher has actually recorded with Paul McCartney and Paul Weller in the past, the three musicians teaming up in 1995, alongside Ocean Colour Scene guitarist Steve Craddock and Young Disciples vocalist Carleen Anderson, to record a cover of The Beatles' Come Together for the War Child charity album The Help Album, billed as The Smokin' Mojo Filters.Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds released released their fourth studio album, Council Skies earlier this year, but Gallagher wasn't impressed with how the record was received when the band toured the US with Garbage, where it became all too obvious that very few in the audience had heard the album.

""I've known Duff since he was in his early twenties,"" Pop tells Classic Rock's Ian Fortnam. ""Both he and Slash worked on [Iggy’s 1990 album] Brick By Brick. I used to go over to Duff’s house – at the time he was trying to decide between the Playboy model he was dating and the weather girl – and rehearse. One time Slash was three hours late because, he said, 'I’m sorry but my snake escaped into the wall'.""Recalling the trio's somewhat unorthodox working methods, Pop says, ""Before we set to work they said: “We’ll have to have a discussion before we start.” So they arrived with a gallon of vodka and a bowl of blow and, as a result of living through that, I got to know them pretty well.""Pop's 19th solo album, Every Loser is reviewed in the new issue of Classic Rock, with Ian Fortnam calling it ""a stone-cold classic"", noting ""Every Loser captures an Iggy Pop never more ready to be himself.""Elsewhere in his CR interview, Pop reflects upon becoming accepted by the mainstream, and his Lifetime Achievement Grammy award.

""Things changed and society met me halfway,"" he states. ""The Grammys kept wanting to talk to me on the phone and I kept telling my manager: 'I don’t want to talk to them. I hate those people. They want me to be an exhibit in their museum or something.' Then when I finally spoke to the lady from the Grammys a couple of months later she said: 'We’re giving you the lifetime achievement. Without you there’s no Lil Nas X and there’s no Billie Eilish.' According to her, 'You’re a direct link to the artists that are at the top of our awards list this year.'

louder;Watch Iron Maiden bring sexy back with the aid of an exotic dancer;Iron Maiden's performance of 22 Acacia Avenue at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1982 saw the Londoners try to 'sex up' their presentation. They wouldn't try this again;"Some bands never quite fit the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll cliche. Take Iron Maiden - one of the world's most iconic metal bands, and breakout stars of NWOBHM known to take things to excess (so far as spectacular stage-shows and epic lyrical narratives go, at least). At the same time, Maiden were, and indeed remain, a band so removed from the blowjobs n' blow image of the Sunset Strip they might as well be Geography teachers. That doesn't mean the East Londoners didn't have their dalliances with sex appeal in the 80s however - and we're not just talking about Bruce Dickinson's leather trousers. 

When Maiden embarked on The Beast On The Road tour in 1982 they were starting to lay the groundwork for the prop-filled live shows that would become so iconic in later years. But while flamethrowers and inflatable devils are something you expect to see at a modern Maiden gig, the appearance, for perhaps 90 seconds, of a female dancer during the quintet's performance of 22 Acacia Avenue at Hammersmith Odeon came as something of a surprise. It was March 20 1982 and Bruce Dickinson was making his debut headline performance at the iconic west London venue. The Number Of The Beast wouldn't be released for another couple of days (and wouldn't hit the top of the charts in the UK until a few weeks later on April 10), but Maiden knew they needed to do something special for the gig. Lugging along a full film crew, the band decided to film the gig for the live album Beast Over Hammersmith, chucking a few theatrical twists into their set that would later become iconic parts of their live show. A 20-foot Eddie and dancing devils accompanied Iron Maiden, while Children Of The Damned enjoyed Hammer Horror worthy visuals courtesy of plumes of dry ice. But for 22 Acacia Avenue, the band went down a slightly different route with the inclusion of an exotic dancer, who looks unsettlingly like Bonnie Tyler, at first glance at least, coming out to dance at the front of the stage. It's decidedly more Mötley Crüe than Maiden's usual fare, but also fits the song's theme perfectly. One of the earliest Dickinson-fronted songs to appear in Maiden's set, 22 Acacia Avenue actually started life in Adrian Smith's former band Urchin. Brought over when Smith joined Maiden, the song took on new life as a sort-of sequel to Charlotte The Harlot from the band's self-titled debut album. The song has since gone on to become a fan-favourite and has been played live over 500 times, though (perhaps unsurprisingly) the band haven't opted to bring back the dance routine for subsequent performances. 

After all, if it comes to a toss-up in the budget between exotic dancers and life-sized biplanes, we'd like to think we know which way Bruce's bread is buttered. 10 bands who wouldn't exist without Iron MaidenIron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith: My Life in 10 SongsThe 50 best Iron Maiden songs of all timeEvery song on Number Of The Beast, ranked";2022-03-23;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-iron-maiden-bring-sexy-back-with-the-aid-of-an-exotic-dancer;2022-03-24;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDWATCHIRONMAIDENBRINGSEXYBACKWITHTHEAIDOFANEXOTICDANCER

""On the surface, it appears to be about magic swords and heroes, but it's actually a story about confronting evil, how to survive it, and how to face despair and heartache. And most importantly, it's about why the pursuit of profound and lasting joy in an often joyless world is worthwhile, even when all available evidence suggests it cannot be found.""   Babb says he chose to open the album with a ballad.

This ultra-cringe version of Survivor classic Eye Of The Tiger might be the final proof that the devil does indeed have all the best tunes";"When one thinks of the best motivational music, Survivor's 1982 classic Eye Of The Tiger is usually at the top of the list. Released as the theme song for Rocky III, the anthem is forever instilled in our minds thanks to the scene that sees everyone's favourite boxing champ (played by Sylvester Stallone) working up a sweat in preparation to fight off new competition. Plus, it's always welcome at karaoke, so what's not to love?Cheesy it may be, Eye Of The Tiger is all about keeping your eyes on the prize, crushing your enemies and rising up to meet your best self. It's powerful stuff. So, we can kind of see why it was so easily reworked by this Christian church to be a song about keeping your eyes on the prize (Jesus), crushing your enemies (Satan), and rising up to meet your best self (sins begone!).During the sermon of one Christian church in the US, a devotedly religious couple called Nick and Haley Gaglione covered the rock anthem, and have since found their video of the performance spiralling across all corners of the internet to erm, many mixed reviews.For the most part, viewers are flabbergasted how the already cheesy song has somehow managed to escalate in cringe. Although, we're pretty sure it's down to the couple's revised lyrics. The fact that the pair - who also go by the name 2ForChrist - are so enthusiastic about their creation too, adds to its awkwardness, considering their audience seem about as interested in the performance as a hardcore Cannibal Corpse fan at a Mariah Carey concert. Some of our favourite lyrics include: 'Rising up, right to the top, fight for Christ, give him glory', and also the rapped line 'Listen. Before I was a Christian, something was missing, felt a little distant, dark-resisting'. To be honest, all the lyrics are brilliant (in their own way).Later in the performance, after some lines about defeating Satan, Nick runs off into the crowd while punching the air in token Rocky style, while trying (and subsequently failing) to squeeze a response out the audience. Nevertheless, the duo remain as chipper as ever, and finish back to back in a triumphant pose. Before our skin tries to detach itself from our bodies in hope of escaping the overwhelming sense of cringe, here it is below.

""I wanted to write something energetic with a big singalong chorus and several scene-changes.  Lyrically it's very loosely based on a fictional character who finds the place he's lived his whole life has quickly turned dangerous and even dystopian. Or, maybe it's not...” Talking about the new album, Beogehold adds “Only Passing Through, our third album picks up where Prehensile Tales left off but soon takes several stylistic detours as it progresses. Everyone involved made this album a lot of fun to make and we're all looking forward to it to finally being heard.""""This new album draws from a lot of different sources and pushes all of us to bring out our best,"" adds drummer Jimmy Keegan. ""We all had to dig pretty deep to express out the right spirit of each song.  To call it prog would be highly inadequate. We’re all over the map and yet, there is still a very distinct sound that threads through the whole album. I’m very proud of this record and excited for people to hear it!""Only Passing Through will be available on limited edition ‘SleevePac’, CD Jewelcase (Canada, Mexico, USA), Gatefold black 180g LP+CD (etching on Side D) and as a digital album.Pre-order Only Passing Through.";2022-01-31;https://www.loudersound.com/news/pattern-seeking-animals-release-video-for-i-cant-stay-here-anymore;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDPATTERN-SEEKINGANIMALSRELEASEVIDEOFORICAN'TSTAYHEREANYMORE

I was so excited to get in a session with Cody in general but the collab that it morphed into was honestly more fun than I could’ve even hoped for.""Under the accompanying Deathcats-directed video on her YouTube page, she writes: ""For people that have been following my project since the beginning, you know that before I even started posting music on tik tok I was posting content about bands I loved.""Set It Off has always been one of those bands. Every chance I got growing up I’d be sure to go to meet and greets, buy albums etc. and I’ve always been in love with the way they can bring both pop and theatrics into edgier music.""Although sonically I ended up in a slightly different realm the energy I have was largely influenced by them. Getting to work with and becoming friends with this band has been one of the most full circle moments for me as a musician and you can see and hear how much fun we had making this track. 

It’s meant to be a fun and crazy mash up of our two worlds and a nod to something we were very stoked on walking into the session that day… Mr. and Mrs. Smith .. I mean Barbie & Ken.""In September, Scene Queen will be embarking on her first ever US headline tour.

The success of their 2021 debut album Eternal Blue was confirmation that here was a band well deserving of their hype which surrounded them, and cemented them as vital new faces on a flourishing global metal scene.Now, in conversation with Kerrang!, the Canadian quartet discussed their following material and anxieties surrounding their desire for creative freedom, especially while they remain in the spotlight. And it turns out, the band are already working on eight new songs.“As scary as it is, you just have to do what makes you happy, create the music you want to create, and work with the people you want to work with,” explains guitarist Mike Stringer. “Because the moment you start limiting yourself, the music suffers.”Elaborating on what the new tracks will sound like, vocalist Courtney LaPlante says “They’re really different to the songs on Eternal Blue. I think some people might even hate them. But that makes me excited. I thrive on negativity!”

Stringer adds, “Eternal Blue spanned over two years. And so much happened over those years. Now we’re different people with different tastes and it’s nice to be able to sit down and be like, ‘What do I want to hear? What do I enjoy?’”“We feel really energised playing and recording the new songs,” Courtney continues. “I hope that will translate to those listening.

But you’re going to hear that it’s Amon Amarth, and there are a lot of really strong melodies and hooks in there.""It’s gonna be interesting to see what the fans think. Personally, I love it. It’s the direction I wish our previous album had taken. There are some songs that I feel are close to my heart because of the lyrics. The last song of the album has a melancholic, sombre tone. It’s a bit more reflective and it’s going to be interesting to see what people take away from it.""Asked whether it ever gets tiring writing songs about Vikings, Hegg added: “It depends. I was working on lyrics for one of the songs on this album and I was like, ‘This really sounds familiar.’""Then I realised it was basically the same story I’d written for another song on another album, just in a different way.

Movie, which sees him co-star and perform as the franchise's villain Bowser. The song, in true Black fashion, is characteristically OTT, and sees the actor brood as the anthropomorphic turtle over his one true love, Princess Peach, voiced in the film by Anya Taylor Joy.Over the weekend, on June 25, the Tenacious D star delivered a surprise performance of the track at The Game Awards 10–Year Concert, a night of video game music held at the Hollywood Bowl, and backed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.Ahead of the performance, Black strolls out from the side of the stage to the astonishment of the audience, sporting the green suit and red-feathered helmet that he dons in the song's accompanying music video.Performing with all the ridiculous and theatrical gusto we know and love, Black climbs onto a piano and sprawls out in a sort of melodramatic, lovelorn daze, before then breaking down to the floor and letting out a deranged squawk, making for quite the hilarious watch.Peaches is Jack Black's first ever solo hit, peaking at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its Cole Bennett-directed music video has amassed 45 million YouTube views following its release just two months ago.Watch the performance, via footage provided by IGN, below:

No, really.Posted by YouTube channel AI Playgrounds, the 1994 R&B classic sounds like a whole new song, and it has us both enthralled and horrified over the strange powers of AI.Within the cover, instead of the honey-soft smoothness of Seal's croon, we're left with something which sounds as scratchy as someone having swallowed down chunks of sandpaper. When you get past the forcefulness of ""Hetfield's"" voice, however, it turns into something actually quite beautiful. It's also really rather amusing, especially when he unexpectedly dips into falsetto. It makes us wonder how accurate it would be to a real Seal cover by the Metallica frontman, although we imagine the chances of that happening are somewhat slim.One viewer underneath the video writes: ""The answer to the question no one's ever asked: what does Papa Het sing in the shower?"".

This time, bootleg guru Bill McClintock has welded Prince's classic Let's Go Crazy to Slayer's Black Magic, and the result is magnificent. It's a party anthem for the ages. A tonic for a shattered world. And a demonic disco delight. Also making seamless contributions to the mash-up are Eddie Van Halen, who contributes a brief flurry of notes from Van Halen's I’m the One, and Jimmy Page, who inserts a longer section of the solo from Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. Frequent visitors to this site will be familiar with the marvellous McClintock, who has a long history of conjuring up magic from the unlikeliest of source material. Like the time he combined Aerosmith and Aretha Franklin. And the time he combined Metallica and Leo Sayer. And the time he bolted Van Halen to Hank Williams. And the time he introduced James Hetfield to Huey Lewis and made beautiful. And... you get the idea. The man's clearly a genius. ""Trying to find two compatible songs takes a really long time,"" McClintock told Mouthing Off in 2020. ""You would think that the more you do, the easier it gets. However, I think that it has gotten more difficult – my standards are higher. For example, if a song is 95% compatible, but there is this one thing I don’t like. There’s no way to edit around it, it wouldn’t sound right if I tried changing it, so I have to go to some other combination.""That part of it is so frustrating, it's incredibly frustrating.

“I guess I was in kind of a zombie state, just playing,"" says Santiago. ""After I stopped playing I put it down and went, 'Well, that was a fucking waste of time, what a piece of shit I am.' I beat myself up a lot, but my girlfriend, unbeknownst to me, was recording me. She played it back to me and I go, 'Fuck! Hold on a second here! This stuff is good!'”Dregs Of The Wine opens with the lyric, ""While I prefer the original version of You Really Got Me, she will defer to the Van Halen version.""Black Francis says the song is about “living in Los Angeles in the ’90s with my then-wife, hanging out with Joey and his ex-wife, lots of trips to Las Vegas, a lot of drinking, little bit drug taking, some genuine good times.”Listen to the song below""Produced by Tom Dalgety (Killing Joke/Therapy?), Doggerel will be the fourth album Pixies have released since their reformation in 2004: the group's original line-up - Black Francis, Kim Deal, Santiago and David Lovering - released four albums between 1986 and 1993. Bassist Paz Lenchatin, formerly of A Perfect Circle and Zwan, replaces Kim Deal in the current line-up.“This time around we have grown,” says Joey Santiago. “We no longer have under two-minute songs.

louder;Steve Howe announces second album with Virgil – watch the cosmic video for Lunar Mist here;Yes guitarist Steve Howe gathers late son's recordings for their second full-length collaboration, Lunar Mist;"Steve Howe has confirmed he will release a second album under the banner of Virgil and Steve Howe. Lunar Mist will be released via InsideOut on September 23 – watch the video for the title track below.The father-and-son team's completed their first album, Nexus, in August 2017 but a month later, Virgil died unexpectedly. Steve decided to release the record in tribute to the drummer that November but one finished song remained unreleased. “After Nexus,” Steve tells Prog, “I thought maybe that was it, and we wouldn’t have any more resources for Virgil’s music. We had a track of his called Lunar Mist completely finished for a Japanese release, which never transpired. It sat on the shelf, but when I played it again I thought it was fantastic, Virgil had added so much production, keyboard and development ideas. So then I had a good dig around.”Steve, whose most recent album with Yes was 2021's The Quest, began working on the new material over Christmas 2020.""I started by writing chord charts for all the other tunes, before adding guitars and bass guitars to embellish them and bring them to completion. In the most part I kept them as he’d written them but sometimes I expanded them with further ideas and improvisation.""The guitarist adds, “Virgil shows some different musical characteristics here that were such a joy to play on. There’s more of his great drumming and a broader inventiveness in his compositions.""The album – which includes a front cover painting by Virgil's daughter Zuni – will be available on Limited CD Digipak, 180g Black LP, CD and digital formats.Buy the latest issue of Prog Magazine (opens in new tab)(Image credit: Press)Lunar Mist tracklist1.

Taylor got up and played with two guys once, in their hometown of Toronto, Canada. And I have to say, it was not only one of the greatest nights of my life watching him do that, but perhaps, one of the greatest night of his.""Grohl then takes a seat behind the kit for 2112 Part I: Overture and Working Man, filling the stool vacated by the late Neal Peart – fan-shot footage below. ""For Alex and I it's a privilege to be up here and play with SuperDave,"" said Lee from the stage. ""In 2008, as Dave told you, we got a call from Foos' management, asking if we'd come to the Toronto show, and show up so that Taylor could play one of his favourite Rush songs with us. We obliged, and that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""    Drummer Omar Hakim – a friend of Hawkins and one of several musicians mooted as a possible future Foo Fighters drummer – then joined the duo onstage for the classic instrumental YYZ.""You can imagine how nervous I was,"" Hawkins told Prog magazine in 2014. ""But I got through YYZ with them. Even though they told me I was playing too fast! The nerves I was going through; here I was replacing Neil Peart in Rush – well, almost!""The US leg of the Taylor Hawkins tribute takes place at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on September 27.Watch some fan-filmed footage here.Holy crap!

Unveiling the news via Instagram, the Japanese-born British singer-songwriter has confirmed that the album will be titled Hold The Girl, and will land on September 2.The sophomore full-length studio record from the fast-rising alt-pop star, who stole the show at last month's Coachella Festival in California, is one of the most anticipated releases of 2022. The announcement for Hold The Girl was accompanied by a dramatic trailer for the new album, featuring various pieces of footage spliced with snippets of guitars, drum clashes and vocal lines. In 2020, Rina released her debut album, Sawayama, to critical acclaim, with particular praise being directed towards the record's diverse range of influences and heavy use of rock and metal on tracks like XS, STFU! and Who's Gonna Save U Now? If these (very) early indicators are anything to go by, it looks like Rina has been digging into similar inspirations for Hold The Girl.When speaking to Metal Hammer last year about her epic cover of Metallica's Enter Sandman for their Blacklist project, Rina touched on how metal and hard rock have influenced her writing.""My music is a blend of a lot of different genres, but I always find myself taking inspiration from metal,"" she noted. ""Songs like STFU! and XS obviously have metal/nu metal influences, but even my earlier songs like [2017's] Afterlife do as well. I love matching pop production with crunchy guitar riffs and an epic solo.""Watch the announcement video for Hold The Girl below.A post shared by Rina Sawayama (@rinasonline)A photo posted by on";2022-05-16;https://www.loudersound.com/news/rina-sawayama-hold-the-girl-announcement;2022-05-18;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDRINASAWAYAMAANNOUNCESNEWALBUMHOLDTHEGIRL,RELEASESTRAILER

There was this force, all this resentment and anger that was coming out. It came from what we thought was bullshit at the time: politics and war, and upbringing and people’s ways of life.""As Ward tells Classic Rock writer Dave Everley, from the moment he heard Ozzy Osbourne sing, he knew that his new band had potential. But the drummer says he knew this group – originally The Polka Tulk Blues Band, then Earth, then Black Sabbath, after a Boris Karloff B-movie that bassist Geezer Butler’s brother had seen – were on to something genuinely special the very first time they played the song they’d named after their band.“I came away knowing that we were different and that everybody would probably hate us,” he says. “And I was right. But at twenty-one I was unstoppable. I was in Black Sabbath, what did you expect?”

“It was us against the world,” he continues. ""The camaraderie was amazing. We were always fucking around and cracking jokes at each other’s expenses, but we respected each other’s abilities and the friendships we had. We were all from the same place, same background; we had a common language.”For the full interview with Bill Ward, and much, much more, pick up the new issue of Classic Rock, coming soon.";2022-04-27;https://www.loudersound.com/news/we-played-like-punks-all-our-anger-was-coming-out-black-sabbath-and-the-messy-birth-of-heavy-metal;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERSOUND""WEPLAYEDLIKEPUNKS.ALLOURANGERWASCOMINGOUT"":BLACKSABBATHANDTHEMESSYBIRTHOFHEAVYMETAL"

The three-disc set features two CDS and a Blu-ray. The band have also released a video trailer for the new release which you can watch below.The live set was recorded on the band's recent five-date tour of the UK in support of 2021's Day And Age album, at the band's gig at Bath's Komedia in November of last year. The tour saw drummer Craig Blundell rejoin Jem Godfrey, John Mitchell and Nathan King for the live dates.""I keep listening out for the thundering hooves of the four horsemen of the apocalypse at the moment because we’ve finally managed to complete an actual film of a Frost gig,"" exclaims Godfrey.""From the first day that we got together to start writing our fourth album Day And Age to the moment we walked onstage to play it in front of a sold out Bath Komedia with cameras rolling, I’d get quite emotional if I stopped to think about the three year journey… But thankfully my memory’s not what it was so I’ve already forgotten most what we had to do to make all this happen.""We are not habitual live performers so this film we’ve made serves a dual purpose: firstly as an important early 21st century historical record of four elderly men desperately trying to look cool whilst singing a song about a chess playing zombie, but more importantly as an repeatable ambassador for our somewhat… concise UK tour.""I hope this will enable the Frost fans who weren’t able to get to any of the gigs for whatever reason to experience the Island Live tour first hand wherever they are in the world. And yes, Milliontown really is about a chess playing zombie. It seemed like a good idea at the time.""Island Live will be available to pre-order from tomorrow from the Tigermoth store.

It read: “We are deeply saddened today, as we bring the terrible news of David Andersson’s passing. He was one of a kind and a brilliant man in so many ways. He was our guitarist for more than 10 years and had a big impact on Soilwork’s musical journey forward. ""Sadly alcohol and mental illness took you away from us.

So tonight, this song goes out to a white man who watches Ghetto Gaggers and mocks Asian people on a podcast. He also owns my masters. I’ve had enough.”So says alt pop superstar in the making Rina Sawayama in a fiery video taken from her Glastonbury set on Saturday night (June 24), in which the Japanese-British singer unleashes her rage while her band tease the opening notes of Korn's classic debut album opener, Blind. Sawayama is reportedly taking aim at The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, who has been in hot water over an appearance on The Adam Friedland Show earlier this year. During the appearance, Healy and the show's hosts did derogatory impressions of various Asian accents, while Healy also suggested that he watches the violent, racially-tilted porn site Ghetto Gaggers, acknowledging that the site's videos ""brutalised"" women.The ""masters"" line is believed to be in reference to Sawayama being signed to Dirty Hit, a label at which Healy was once director (The Guardian reports that it has reached out to Dirty Hit for comment). Following Sawayama's tirade, her band kick into her nu metal-inspired track STFU!, taken from her critically acclaimed 2020 studio album, Sawayama. In fact, Korn aren't the only nu metal legends referenced in the video: towards the end of the song, her band also drop the bridge from Limp Bizkit anthem Break Stuff, accompanied by Sawayama's take on Fred Durst's iconic ""pack a chainsaw"" refrain.It seems safe to say that Sawayama has some bones to pick, and she's certainly found the perfect soundtrack.

Top Gun and Danger Zone. Titanic and My Heart Will Go On. Men In Black and, er, Men In Black. In the early 90s, few comings together of cinema and music were as instantly iconic as that of James Cameron's spectacular blockbuster sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Guns N' Roses banger You Could Be Mine. Selected especially for the film after some direct involvement from Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger himself, the track is heard playing in one early scene courtesy of young John Connor and his chum, as well as playing over the film's end credits. The video for the single even got in on the act, uniting Schwarzenegger with Guns N' Roses along with footage from the film.In a new interview, however, T2 star Robert Patrick, who played the villainous T-1000 in the film and has also appeared in the likes of The X-Files and Peacemaker, revealed that had he had his way, it wouldn't have been Guns N' Roses' music appearing in the sequel at all.""When I was making Terminator 2, I used to work out to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails, because my younger brother, Richard Patrick, was a touring guitarist for them,"" Patrick reveals to The Guardian. ""I took it to Jim Cameron and tried to get him to use it for the soundtrack to Terminator 2, but he said: 'No. Arnold prefers Guns N’ Roses,' who went on to record You Could Be Mine, an original song for Terminator 2. It’s ironic because Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails has won a couple of Oscars for his soundtracks now.""Patrick also reveals that he's a huge Jimi Hendrix and Black Sabbath fan, noting: ""I vividly remember riding my Stingray bicycle to Kmart in Kettering, Ohio, to buy Hendrix In The West – the live album by Jimi Hendrix – and Master Of Reality by Black Sabbath, both in the early 70s, with the money I’d made from doing rough carpentry work.

It also referenced Waters' use of a pig-shaped balloon emblazoned with a Star of David and corporate logos on previous tours.The statement additionally noted the historical significance of the venue, Festhalle, being the site where 3,000 Jewish men were held under arrest in 1938 ahead of their deportation to concentration camps following Kristallnacht, the violent anti-Jewish demonstrations which saw Nazis destroy Jewish-owned stores, buildings and synagogues.Now however, Waters has declared that he is ""coming anyway"" to Frankfurt, in spite of the cancelled show, via an Instagram post showing a photo of the grave of Sophie Scholl, a German student and anti-Nazi activist who was beheaded by guillotine in 1943 for handing out anti-war leaflets around the University of Munich.The musician revealed to have also filed an injunction against the council, although is yet to hear a response.“Frankfurt Council were legally required to respond to Roger Waters [sic] interim injunction by midnight April 14,” Waters writes. “Did they? Nobody knows? We can only guess at what’s going on in Frankfurt? Are they playing for time? Who knows?“Not that it matters much! We’re coming anyway! Because human rights matter!

louder;Jeff Berlin to release tribute to the late Cream bassist Jack Bruce;Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Tony Levin, Gary Husband, Sammy Hagar and more feature on Jeff Berlin's Jack Songs tribute album;"Former Bruford bassist Jeff Berlin is to release a tribute to his friend, the late Cream bass player Jack Bruce, with the release of Jack Songs on August 2. You can watch Berlin discuss the project in a video below.“Recording the music of Jack Bruce has been the most emotional recording project of my career,"" explains Berlin. ""Jack was the greatest bass influence I ever had. In the center of his music were these strange and wonderful bass lines weaving in and out of the key, reaching for resolutions and finding them, again, and again. Jack’s playing was a living evolving improvisation.

""Jack was the Alpha and Omega for me. I never would have become the bass player I became if I didn't hear his unfettered improvisations and innovations, his creating a completely original bass tone, and his playing every gig as if it was his last. When he died, I immediately set out to honour him by reviewing his music to choose some of my favourite songs of his and recording them via my own musical vision. As was his legacy of musical brilliance, I wanted this record to be brilliant to honour his spirit. He really means this much to me.The star-studded new album features guest appearances from Rush's Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, King Crimson's Tony Levin, Sons Of Apollo's Billy Sheehan, Mark King, Nathan East, Gary Husband and more...""Jack Songs isn’t a cover CD, not in the literal sense,"" Berlin continues. ""Except for a couple of tunes from his Cream period (arranged in ways that should surprise people) most of the songs on this CD come from other periods in Jack’s musical life after Cream. Jack’s solo career represented a multitude of musical styles. This recording will be a new revamp of some of those songs, some of the best music that I heard from one of the greatest musicians of the last fifty years.

In arranging the music, I was inspired by Giles Martin’s production of The Beatles Love CD. His production work on this CD is fantastic. I tried to follow his example of his fitting various Beatle song quotes from different tunes into each tune by doing a similar thing by combining different Jack songs. Rather than computerised manipulation of music that was already recorded, I arranged the music so that each song on Jack Songs would end up as an individual work comprised of various parts of other songs in them. I never would have thought of this without Giles showing me this path.”Pre-order Jack Songs.(Image credit: Press)";2022-08-04;https://www.loudersound.com/news/jeff-berlin-to-release-tribute-to-the-late-cream-bassist-jack-bruce;2022-08-06;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDJEFFBERLINTORELEASETRIBUTETOTHELATECREAMBASSISTJACKBRUCE

In a lengthy video interview with German journalist Edgar Klüsener in 1993, which you can watch below, Krist Novoselic marvelled at being in the music section of a small department store in Longview, Washington and noticing that it continued releases by Mudhoney, Sebadoh, Sonic Youth and more. “A couple of years ago that was impossible,” agrees Kurt Cobain. “The kids down there are exposed to that and it’s really positive,” nods Novoselic. “What’s happened to us has opened a lot of doors.”But, of course, there was a flipside in becoming so huge too. The way Novoselic saw it, the pre-Nirvana landscape was made up of what he called the “those old rock dinosaurs, the hairspray bands hanging on doing the same thing, emulating Hanoi Rocks.” Standing next to him, it prompts Dave Grohl to recount what a photographer had recently told him. “We did a photo shoot with someone for the cover of a magazine,” says the long-haired, fresh-faced Grohl, “and he was telling us the story of how Bon Jovi came in with a flannel shirt on and said, ‘make me look like Nirvana’. If Bon Jovi wants to look like us, you know something is wrong.” The story certainly gets Cobain’s attention. “That’s pretty flattering,” says the singer. “It just proves he’s a desperate, untalented piece of shit.”Later, Kurt ponders how having his own band constantly in the press and being written about affected how he viewed other groups. “I don’t even find myself having very many opinions on bands anymore or putting them down because I don’t know these people,” he says, thoughts once again returning to Jon Bon’s crew. “Bon Jovi could be one of the nicest people in the world… his music sucks but I don’t even want to bother with expressing those kind of opinions anyway,” he said, immediately after expressing those opinions.Watch the interview in full below.;2023-07-21;https://www.loudersound.com/news/nirvana-on-bon-jovi;2023-07-23;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDER""HE’SADESPERATE,UNTALENTEDPIECEOFS***"":NIRVANAONTHETIMEBONJOVIWANTEDTOLOOKLIKETHEM"

It's an unusual choice: the track wasn't from the band's current album, the previous year's Hello. Nor was it a preview of material from Quo, which would released the following month. Instead, the band played a live favourite from 1972's Piledriver.   We'll probably never know why this track (the only one they played on the show) was chosen. Rick Parfitt's voice is largely shot, and Francis Rossi's guitar solo certainly isn't his best, but when it all comes together – as it does at the 2'50"" mark – it's a vivid reminder of how powerful Status Quo could be. Quo's episode was hosted by soul legend Curtis Mayfield – who performed four songs – while the other performers included two more soul acts in The Impressions and Gladys Knight & The Pips, plus folk musician Phil Ochs and Green Eyed Lady hitmakers Sugarloaf. Status Quo would return to the US in August 1974, playing a mix of small club gigs and larger shows, sharing the stage with the likes of Montrose, Rory Gallagher, Todd Rundgren, Little Feat and Sly & the Family Stone. Other artists who performed on The Midnight Special – whose appearances will presumably become available over the coming months – include Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Kiss, Elton John, AC/DC, Badfinger, The Cars, Cheap Trick, Peter Frampton, Genesis, Heart, Little Feat, Prince, Roxy Music, Steely Dan, Thin Lizzy and ELO";2023-04-23;https://www.loudersound.com/news/status-quos-long-lost-1974-appearance-on-the-midnight-special-has-finally-been-found;2023-04-23;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSTATUSQUO'SLONG-LOST1974APPEARANCEONTHEMIDNIGHTSPECIALHASFINALLYBEENFOUND

louder;Noel Gallagher recalls the moment he knew he was set for success with Oasis;Noel Gallagher says he realised his songs had promise after explosive moment in early Oasis jam session;"Noel Gallagher says the moment he realised he was set for success with Oasis was like an ""explosion"" as he heard the band playing one of his songs for the first time.The guitarist was Oasis' main songwriter, but when he first joined his brother Liam's band their early gigs featured none of his material. It was after one of those early gigs that Liam asked Noel to play one of his songs, and everything changed.Noel tells BBC Radio 2's First and Last: ""I was just sitting, playing guitar. I remember our kid saying, ‘Well, let’s do one of yours. What have you got? You've got tunes anyway.’ So I was like, ‘Okay, well, if I play that, you play this, you do that beat.’“And then, at that moment, an explosion went off, because when you hear your own songs for the first time being played by other people, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow!’” And I remember that being a hair on the back of the neck moment where it’s like, ‘This sounds amazing!’ From that moment onward I was obsessed with it, and still am to this day.""Despite his incredible success both with Oasis and since the band's split in 2009, Gallagher admits he's ""not as good as people think I am.""He adds: “I’ve learned as a songwriter not to overthink it, not to chase it. I’ve accepted that I’ve got a knack for melody. I’m not as good as people think I am. I think that’s healthy.""I can write a tune. But there’s people who write better tunes than me. Even though I don’t chase it I never stopped digging.

louder;Rage-fuelled Karens screaming along to metal riffs is comedy gold once again;The internet's favourite comedy guitarist Andre Antunes has created another Karen Metal video - and it's still extremely funny;"Although finding comedic value in someone's emotional outburst can feel somewhat cruel, sometimes, when their behaviour is a derived purely from the fact they are being an arsehole, there is some wiggle room when it comes to pointing the finger and having a giggle.This excusable grey area is most often reserved for 'Karens' - middle-aged, usually white women with a baffling level of entitlement and unchallenged anger problems, who also seemingly have a weird amount of untapped potential when it comes to metal. Thanks to guitar mash-up maverick Andre Antunes, we've been well aware of this phenomenon for some time; he's meshed together the vocals of our favourite livid ladies against heavy metal riffs on numerous occasions. Now, Antunes has created the fifth entry in the series with Karen Metal 5.Behold as Antunes expertly riffs along to one woman's wrathful rant, apparently sparked when a man did not offer her a seat on a busy bus. ""SHOW ME WHICH ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO BE A GENTLEMAN!"" she roars, before turning up the tempo and letting her temper loose. Our axe-slinging wizard Antunes, though, doesn't fall behind for a minute, and fires out riffs in a jaunty Karen-led mixture of time signatures. Later in the video, there's even a Big Boss Karen, who is, unsurprisingly, also extremely pissed off at something.If you're a fan of what you see here, may we suggest you check out Antunes' other creations, such as his video of an overly-enthusiastic American pastor shouting along to riffs, or a Navy sergeant shouting along to riffs, and more. It's basically a lot of shouting and riffs.Watch Karen Metal 5 below:";2022-04-25;https://www.loudersound.com/news/rage-fuelled-karens-screaming-along-to-metal-riffs-is-comedy-gold-once-again;2022-04-27;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDRAGE-FUELLEDKARENSSCREAMINGALONGTOMETALRIFFSISCOMEDYGOLDONCEAGAIN
louder;Metallica's first setlist of 2022 shows they're not f**king about;Metallica's hit-filled Vegas setlist with supports Greta Van Fleet and Ice Nine Kills is giving us a FOMO overload;"Metallica's first show of 2022 proved to be a triumphant affair as the band made their 2022 live debut at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Playing for the first time since their mammoth 40th Anniversary celebrations in San Francisco in December 2021, Metallica played things relatively safe with a hits-packed setlist of live favourites.With support coming from rising stars Ice Nine Kills and Greta Van Fleet, we figured it was a good time to get a good look at everything we've learned from Metallica's first show of 2022...Ice Nine Kills' live shows are as insane as their videosIce Nine Kills made quite the stir with last year's The Silver Scream 2: Welcome To Horrorwood, the band's music videos helping to cement their reputation for brilliantly unhinged, Broadway-style metalcore. Judging from the videos emerging from Vegas, their live set is just as filled with Alice Cooper/GWAR style theatricality, complete with severed heads. It's one hell of a show and justifies their inclusion at #3 the Hammer best albums of 2021 list. Massive stages suit Ice Nine Kills wellThe likes of Architects, Parkway Drive and Bullet For My Valentine have long-since proven that metalcore can go over exceptionally well on massive stages. But honestly, watching videos of Ice Nine Kills own every inch of space at stadium level is exactly the kind of inspiring thing we want to see from up-and-coming metal bands in 2022. No wonder they were bumped up to Second Stage at this year's Download Festival... Greta Van Fleet are stadium rock reinvented for the 2020sYes, yes we all know the Led Zeppelin comparisons when it comes to Greta Van Fleet, but you know what else they do like Led Zeppelin? Own stadiums. GvF have been in ascendance for some time now, so seeing them up and playing stadiums alongside Metallica feels like just one step removed from the band coming back to headline those same stages one day - and we're very here for it. We'll happily see drum solos retired, mindWe love the return of so many great rock tropes of the 70s, but drum solos aren't one of them. Up there with 25-minute noodling guitar solos, we shouldn't need some overblown segment where the rest of the band nip backstage for 'refreshments' to show us how good you are - that's what the songs are for. No-one does intros like MetallicaIt's a given fact of life that Metallica will take to the stage to the stirring notes of Ennio Morricone's The Ecstasy Of Gold, but the inclusion of ACDC's It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock N Roll) has added a touch of rock'n'roll nostalgia in recent years. Add to that the fact the band kicked off with Whiplash and we're talking full-throttle thrash brilliance to get right into the swing of things. Opening with Whiplash!! #Metallica pic.twitter.com/Oak5nfbE2DFebruary 26, 2022See moreMetallica are sticking to the hitsAnyone hoping the inclusion of Load, St. Anger and Death Magnetic rarities in the 40th Anniversary shows might prompt some stylistic risk-taking was left disappointed by Metallica's first setlist of 2022.That said, you really can't argue with Metallica sticking to the hits, especially when you're talking about some of the biggest songs in the entire metal genre. Master Of Puppets, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Sad But True - these are the songs lesser bands' careers are made of, and Metallica hand them out like they're on sale. James Hetfield's words of encouragement are a light in these dark timesFade To Black may have some (unearned) infamy among the 80s metal elite who couldn't quite reconcile the idea of acoustic guitars and thrash coming together, but it also opened an entirely different branch of introspective, heartfelt songwriting to the band. Considering James Hetfield's public battles with his own demons, hearing him give a heartfelt speech during Fade To Black is exactly the kind of showing we want from our metal icons in 2022. ""This song goes out to all who struggle, because we all do. If you think you're the only one... it's a lie. You can talk to your friends, talk to somebody - because you are not alone.""We're jealous of anyone that gets to see Metallica this yearWith their calendar slots already filling up (including festival dates in Europe this summer), it's looking likely that Metallica's schedule for 2022 might be almost completely announced.That means the band's appearance at Las Vegas's Allegiant Stadium is one of only a handful of US stadium headline shows this year. Meanwhile, fans in the UK will need to cross over to the continent this summer if we've any hope of seeing Metallica in 2022 (don't tempt us). Metallica are looking - and sounding - great going into 2022With a full stadium set-up behind them, Metallica were able to bring their production to life in Las Vegas. It looked utterly incredible and now we've got a serious case of FOMO. Metallica performing on 2/25/22 in Las Vegas, NV.

louder;Remembering the time Kate Bush performed Running Up That Hill with Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and made magic;David Gilmour – who discovered Kate Bush when she was a teen – performed alongside the British vocalist for a rendition of her 1985 hit;"Thanks to Netflix's immensely popular sci-fi/horror series Stranger Things, Kate Bush's fantastical 1985 ballad Running Up That Hill is going through a renaissance as of late, with the song infiltrating all corners of the web, be it via humorous reactionary videos on TikTok or gate-keeping quips on Twitter, as well as topping charts.What better opportunity, then, to shine a light on one of the most extraordinary and perhaps overlooked collaborations our world has seen: Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Kate Bush performing a duet of Running Up That Hill together in 1987, at the Secret Policeman’s Ball inside the London Palladium.There's a significant backstory between the pair, too, which makes the moment even more magical. While Bush was still at school as a teen, her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions. The demo tape was sent out to a load of record labels and swiftly turned down - until the Pink Floyd guitarist got involved.When the tape was passed on to Gilmour by Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of the guitarist and Bush family, he was immediately smitten with her otherworldly and unique voice - so much so that he made it his priority to get her signed. From then on, a life-long friendship, and fruitful career, was formed.“I was intrigued by this strange voice,” Gilmour said in a BBC interview. “I went to her house, met her parents down in Kent. And she played me, gosh, it must have been 40 or 50 songs on tape. And I thought: ‘I should try and do something.'“I think we had the [EMI] record-company people down at Abbey Road in No. 3,” Gilmour adds. “And I said to them, ‘Do you want to hear something I’ve got?’ They said sure, so we found another room and I played them The Man with a Child in his Eyes. And they said, ‘Yep, thank you — we’ll have it.’ [Laughs.]""On top of scoring her a recording contract with EMI, who she released five full-length records with, Gilmour managed to persuade Bush – who was notoriously uninterested in live performances – to take to the stage with him in both 1987 and 2002. The latter saw Bush join Gilmour again for another rendition, this time to sing Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb at the Royal Festival Hall.As for their main collaborations, Gilmour produced two songs on Bush's debut album, The Kick Inside. He also performs backing vocals on Pull Out the Pin and plays guitar on Love and Anger and Rocket’s Tail.Check out the 1987 performance of Running Up That Hill below:";2022-05-31;https://www.loudersound.com/news/remembering-the-time-kate-bush-performed-running-up-that-hill-with-pink-floyds-david-gilmour-and-made-magic;2022-06-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDREMEMBERINGTHETIMEKATEBUSHPERFORMEDRUNNINGUPTHATHILLWITHPINKFLOYD'SDAVIDGILMOURANDMADEMAGIC

It's taken from the band's 24th studio Carpe Diem, which is out now, and we're saying the verses sound a bit like AC/DC's Hell's Bells. “Pilgrimage is a fantastic word,” exclaims frontman Biff Byford, “People go on pilgrimages all the time, not just in a historical or religious sense, but it’s about going and visiting either a place that you feel is special in your life or somebody that’s meant something in your life. ""You can go on a pilgrimage to go see your great grandfather who died in the First World War for instance. They’re journeys of great weight and importance.""The release comes at the end of a week in which Saxon played two 40th Anniversary shows, at Manchester's O2 Apollo and London's Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, supported by fellow members of British rock royalty Uriah Heep, Girlschool and Diamond Head. The release of The Pilgrimage comes less than a month after the launch of Remember The Fallen, a song paying tribute to the millions worldwide who've died after contracting Covid-19. The band shared a video for Carpe Diem's title track in November. ""We never make an album that we don’t expect to be fantastic,” says Byford, “because there are no laurels around here, and as a band, we’re always trying to do something a little bit new, a little bit daring. ""I love fast metal like Princess Of The Night and 20,000 Feet, and I try and bring that style of Saxon into the music now, but in a more modern style.

A certain Slayer legend would like a word;"Dave Lombardo, the legendary former Slayer drummer and current man behind the kit for extreme metal project Empire State Bastard, has come to the defence of Metallica icon Lars Ulrich. Speaking exclusively to Metal Hammer, Lombardo is robust in his answer as to whether he feels Ulrich gets unfairly dismissed as a drummer by many metal fans.“Absolutely!"" he agrees. ""I saw Mario Duplantier recently talking about Lars, saying some kind words. I feel Lars is  an essential part of that band – anybody else and it just won’t sound the same. I admonish the  people who talk shit about him, I don’t like that. You have to embrace who Lars is, and his  contribution to Metallica’s sound. They’re such an inspirational band, and everybody wants to be as big as they are, and you can only do that by taking risks. They shocked people when they cut their  hair or whatever, but it was part of their evolution and they clearly knew what they were doing. I love that they’re still out there, kicking ass.""Lombardo also discusses his favourite of his drumming contemporaries, naming one artist in particular from some Bay Area icons that he's always had the utmost respect for. “There were so many great drummers, I can’t just pinpoint one,"" he says. ""You admire bands with good drummers, but for me, Tom Hunting from Exodus was the first I saw, when we left LA and went to San Francisco I saw them and was like ‘this guy is badass, and you know what? He still is! We played a show with those guys in Testament [Lombardo played with Testament from 98-99 and 2022-this year], and that guy is stronger than ever. He’s made an amazing comeback after his illness [Hunting was treated for stomach cancer in 2022] and I’m so proud of him, and I’m so happy to have seen those guys as many times as I have.”You can read more from Lombardo's interview in an upcoming issue of Metal Hammer magazine. Earlier this year, Gojira's Mario Duplantier spoke similar sentiments of Lars Ulrich's ability as a drummer, stating on The Downbeat podcast: “We need to bring some justice for him, because it's not about moving tempo-wise. It's what he created in the past. I'm a bit tired of seeing all this conversation about Lars because what he did create is quite unique. Listen to, fucking, …And Justice for All. It's amazing.""It's very physical and what he brought to the table back in the day – you know, playing without shirts and doing all these faces, and standing up behind the kits – is almost more important than the rest,"" he added.";2023-08-16;https://www.loudersound.com/news/dave-lombardo-defends-lars-ulrich;2023-08-16;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERDAVELOMBARDODEFENDSLARSULRICHANDISN'THAPPYWITHHISHATERS:""IADMONISHTHEPEOPLEWHOTALK****ABOUTHIM"""

Or, perhaps you've simply never been about that late gig finish life and enjoy your bed a little more than most.Not all people turn away from evening socialling so easily, but Halloween legend Jamie Lee Curtis is one music fan who would like the live scene somewhat reshuffled to make it a more enjoyable experience for those who don't consider themselves willing to be waiting all night long to see the bands they enjoy.During a conversation on the red carpet at the Independent Spirit Awards this weekend on March 4, Curtis told The Hollywood Reporter that she actually declined her invite to an Oscars nominee dinner because of her desire to go to bed early, and that she'd like more events, such as a concerts, to take place earlier in the day.""Why? Because mommy goes to bed early,” the actor enthuses. “‘Cause 7:30 is gonna be nine before we get food, and you know what? There’s nothing good happening with me after nine o’clock. Nothing. Zero!”.Then, advocating for concerts to have a matinee option, she adds: “I am gonna just say this now as a taunt and as a suggestion. U2: do a matinee. Coldplay: do a matinee. What about a 12 noon concert, Coldplay? What about it, Bruce Springsteen? Do a fucking matinee! You’re old! Why wouldn’t you let me come see you, Bruce Springsteen, in your glory days – pun intended – and do it at noon or one o’clock? two o’clock! two o’clock matinee!“Theatre in New York, two o’clock! I will come and hear your five-hour concert, Bruce, at two o’clock, and I’m gonna be home and in bed by 7:30.”The actor followed up on her idea in a recent interview with Today, noting how she's been asking musicians to embrace her idea of earlier shows. She says, “Why are there no matinees? For instance, I love Coldplay. I would love to go see Coldplay. The problem is, I’m not gonna go see Coldplay if they start their show at nine o’clock and there’s an opening act.

louder;The mystery of which song features THAT guitar solo in the new Stranger Things has been solved;"If you were wondering what song Eddie Munson is shredding in Stranger Things, well, we have the answer: ""It's an inspired choice"" actor Joseph Quinn tells us";"When the trailer for the second volume of Stranger Things dropped last month, the internet had many questions, but one question in particular occupied the thoughts of rock fans, namely what song metalhead Eddie Munson could be shredding on his guitar?Various suggestions were put forward at the time: one popular guess was the guitar solo from Europe's 1986 hallmark anthem The Final Countown, while others plumped for the opening riff to Guns 'N Roses' Sweet Child 'O Mine, which was released a year later on Appetite For Destruction.We called in expert assistance, namely our good pals over at Guitar World, to try to solve the mystery, and the majority opinion was that Munson was shredding Metallica's Master Of Puppets, with Editor In Chief Michael Astley-Brown remarking on Eddie's hand positioning: ""the stuff up the neck is the right position for that solo.""Well, spoiler alert, the truth can now be revealed. And, what d'ya know, the Guitar World crew nailed it:

When we asked actor Joseph Quinn, who plays Eddie Munson, if he personally picked Master Of Puppets for the segment, he told us it was completely [Stranger Things creators and executive producers] the Duffer brothers' idea.

""I just feel that it's the perfect song,"" Quinn added, ""a crescendo to take us through this crazy sequence. It's an inspired choice for the show, definitely.""The show's costume designer recently revealed that the Dio patch featured on the back of Eddie Munson's jacket was bestowed directly from the metal icon's estate.“I love Eddie, I think Eddie feels so real,” said Amy Parris. ""And he’s wearing one thing because he’s in that outfit the whole time, so I really focused and zeroed in on making sure everything in that outfit was authentic.""Stranger Things is streaming on Netflix.";2022-07-01;https://www.loudersound.com/news/the-mystery-of-which-song-features-that-guitar-solo-in-the-new-stranger-things-has-been-solved-and-its-metal-af;2022-07-03;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDTHEMYSTERYOFWHICHSONGFEATURESTHATGUITARSOLOINTHENEWSTRANGERTHINGSHASBEENSOLVED
louder;Blackberry Smoke announce new album Be Right Here, launch Dig A Hole single;Southern rock lynchpins Blackberry Smoke will release their eighth album Be Right Here next year;"Atlanta's finest Blackberry Smoke have announced details of their eighth studio album, Be Right Here. The album was produced by Dave Cobb – who worked with the band on 2021's You Hear Georgia – at Nashville’s RCA Studio A, and then finished at Cobb’s Georgia Mae studio in Savannah, Georgia. It'll be released on February 16 next year, and is available to pre-order now.  News of the the album's release is accompanied by the arrival of its first single, Dig A Hole, the first song band frontman Charlie Starr wrote for the album. Infusing Blackberry Smoke's classic and southern rock sound with a dose of swampy psychedelia, it's also a song with a message.  ""The lyrics for this song came really quickly,"" says Starr. ""We each have a finite amount of time on this earth, so you probably want to make the best out of it instead of wasting it. Eventually for all of us, they are going to you dig a hole, so try to have a good life before they do that."" Be Right Here was recorded in late 2022 and early 2023, during a time in which drummer Brit Turner – who remains a fully active member of the band – was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, a type iof brain tumour. The band (Starr and Turner, plus bassist Richard Turner, guitarist Paul Jackson and keyboardist Brandon Still) are joined on the album by touring members Preston Holcomb and Benji Shanks, plus guest vocalists The Black Bettys.“We didn’t feel a whole lot of pressure to go in and make this one quickly,” says Starr. ""It’s just as natural and as real as possible. The last album was very raw too, but with this one I remember different times I would say, ‘I think we should redo that,’ and Dave was like, ‘No, leave it that way. That way it’s magical.'""Blackberry Smoke play the Long Road Festival in Leicestershire later this month, and tour the US from September. Full dates below. Blackberry Smoke: Be Right Here tracklist1.

As vocalist Cammie Beverley explains, The Hanging Tree explores the band's childhood:“An old childhood home, a frequently visited spot along the meadow, a closet we pass in our grandmother's house, a tree in the town centre that has scars from its terrible past... places hold memories and they never forget them even when buried under the changes of time.”The Texan prog metal band's fifth album takes more of a singer-songwriter approach with softer vocals, and explores the fictional tale of a religious group, coloured by Beverley's own upbringing. She explains: : “The album is scenery and stories inspired by characters, settings, and themes from the band’s (traumatic) childhood experiences. These encounters are woven into the lives and tales of individuals in a fictitious community living on the Gulf Coast.”The video for The Hanging Tree was directed by Angela Herr and Bianca Greene for FirstSight Agency and is thematically tied to its post-apocalyptic predecessor The Lighthouse.;2022-07-22;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-the-new-video-for-oceans-of-slumbers-the-hanging-tree;2022-07-24;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDWATCHTHENEWVIDEOFOROCEANSOFSLUMBER'STHEHANGINGTREE

Steve and I will probably do something together in the future.""""I won’t get into the details but things were pretty bad internally,"" wrote Stephen. ""That plus creative differences sort of left me with no choice. That said, I’m so thankful for all the amazing fans, people who helped Fever behind the scenes, and my friends and family who supported me through all of this. Your support means so much! I still plan to make music. Aric and I will probably do something together in the future. Love you guys!! Know your worth!""Within 24 hours, frontman Jason addressed the situation in a post on social media.He wrote: ""I want to thank Aric and Stephen for their time in this project – not just because a statement feels required, but because I mean that. We shared some incredible experiences over the last few years and for that I will always be grateful.

""To the supporters of Fever 333 – I started this project in order to fill a space in music and culture that I have always wanted to see and know many others like and unlike me would also like to experience. Offering representation and progress not only on stages but through the art is paramount for me. I told myself I would not compromise that vision and I must hold true to that promise. Not only for me, but the others out there looking for somewhere to feel free. So I want to take this moment to say thank you to Aric, Stephen and everyone who has made that possible thus far. The initial era of Fever 333 was incredible in so many ways and I am so excited to present to you the next one.

Today's stop is Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, for a filming of Saturday Night Live. The excitable hosts are Roseanne and Tom Arnold.Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante is not happy. His relationship with singer Anthony Kiedis has deteriorated, he keeps his distance from the other band members on set, and at the climax of the band's opening number, Stone Cold Bush, he receives a kick from the singer's flailing boot. Deliberate? Maybe. Maybe not.Song two is Under The Bridge. Frusciante plays the intro, but it doesn't sound right. The notes are dissonant jumble. The cadence appears to slow and quicken. It's woozy, almost discombobulating. And when the moment arrives for Kiedis to start singing, Frusciante looks his frontman in the eye for the first time, and holds his gaze for a brief moment. Is he cueing up the vocal? Or is it an act of defiance? Fuck you, man. Follow this. Maybe. Maybe not.In his autobiography Scar Tissue, Kiedis's recalls his confusion. ""I've since heard that John was was a heroin during this show,"" he writes, ""but he may as well have been on another planet, because he started playing some shit I'd never heard before. I had no idea what song he was playing or what key he was in. He looked like he was in a different world. ""To this day, John denies he was playing off-key. According to him, he was experimenting the way he would have if we'd been rehearsing the tune. Well we weren't, we were on live TV in front of millions of people. And it was torture. ""I felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of all of America while this guy was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment. I thought he was doing that on purpose, just to fuck with me.”By the end, Frusciante has cranked up the volume and is howling into his mic. And as the song finishes, Kiedis stares long and hard at his guitarist. It's not difficult to sense the animosity, even if the footage isn't as high-res as it would be today. Despite all this, the Saturday Night Live version of Under The Bridge has become a favourite for many. Some see Frusciante's performance as performance art. Some see it a demonstration of the guitarist's extraordinary talent, in that deliberately screwing up his own part yet retaining enough form for the rest of the band to play theirs would be more difficult than playing it straight. And some see Frusciante's playing as a harrowing manifestation of the pain he was going through.   Frusciante would leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers for the first time later that year, announcing his decision to quit one day into the band’s Japanese tour in May. After a final show at Omiya Sonic City Hall in Saitama, he would fly home. Thankfully, it was not the end of the story.";2022-02-22;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-john-frusciante-sabotage-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-on-saturday-night-live;2022-03-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDWATCHJOHNFRUSCIANTESABOTAGETHEREDHOTCHILIPEPPERSONSATURDAYNIGHTLIVE

""I have always loved instrumental guitar music and to get the chance to make an album of this kind of music is a really exciting thing for me, putting the guitar front and centre.“I feel that I have assembled some of the best musicians that I could for this album, working with Marco and William was a real pleasure. I gave them nearly an empty canvas to work with and for them to do their thing with a short brief for each song and they hit the bull's eye with every track. What they have done has complemented these songs and the guitar melodies and have made these songs even better than I originally thought they could be. Adam Gough in my opinion is one of the most underrated keyboard players out there, what makes him so good is the subtle things he adds to each piece, as well as the big orchestrations things he does, the attention to detail, is crazy, I know he is pleased he was able to use the Hammond on a few tracks on this album.“There will also be a collection of videos accompanying the album which will be available to view on youtube. The album art and the videos have been created by my manager, (also the manager of IO Earth) Wendy Hagenbeek and they have given a visual dimension to the songs. Two of the videos feature Wendy’s daughter Quinley playing a fictitious character and she is also the model for the album art.

""At the time I was working on the 6-CD box Hans Lundin: The Solo Years 1982-1989, and revisiting my old solo albums informed my songwriting process for Urskog. Listening to these old compositions influenced my new compositions in a general way; there were also few instances where I took a nice chord structure or a melodic fragment of an old song and turned it into something entirely new. I also sampled some sounds from the 80's that can be heard on the new album.""The new album also sees the arrival of brand new drummer Darby Todd. Todd, who has worked with Martin Barre, Hot Leg, Robert Plant, Robben Ford, Carl Verheyen and more, replaces Morgan Ågren, who had been with the band since they reformed in 2000.""When the time came around to start tracking drums, Morgan wasn't available within any reasonable timeframe so on Morgan's own suggestion, we decided to amicably part ways,"" explains guitarist Per Nilsson. ""Morgan's fantastic and imaginative drumming has adorned the music of Kaipa for almost two decades and eight albums, but for what it's worth, we felt that this could be an opportunity to bring some new grooves and new sounds into Kaipa. While Hans had a few ideas for the drummer position I only had one person in mind, someone whose creativity and chops rival those of Morgan's but with more of a hard-hitting rock edge, and upon seeing a few videos of this guy bashing the skins Hans was convinced too.""Urskog will be available as a limited CD digipak, gatefold 180g 2LP + CD and as a digital album.Pre-order Urskog.(Image credit: InsideOut Music)Kaipa: Urskog

The wife of late Colosseum drummer Jon Hiseman had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for the past 25 years.In a statement, Thompson's daughter, singer-songwriter Ana Gracey said: ""My mum had the most extraordinary spirit - she never gave up, however, her body finally let her down after a valiant battle with Parkinson’s over the course of 25 years alongside complications with her heart towards the end. We dearly hope that she and our father have found each other once again.""Thompson is best known to fans of progressive music for her work in jazz rockers Colosseum and with Manfred Mann's Earth Band (she featured on 1976's The Roaring Silence and 1980's Chance) and the Keef Hartley Band, however she was also lauded for her contribution to jazz and contemporary classical music as well.Thompson had studied  saxophone and classical composition at the Royal College Of Music, but through her love of the music of John Coltrane and Duke Ellington, she concentrated on jazz. She married Hiseman in 1967 (the pair had met in 1964) and featured on the band's second album, 1969's Valentyne Suite and 1970's fourth album Daughter Of Time from the band's original phase.She helped form the jazz rock group United Jazz + Rock Ensemble, fronted Barbara Thompson's Jubiaba, a nine-piece latin rock outfit who also featured former Soft Machine bassist Roy Babbington, and Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia, which also featured her late husband.Thompson appeared on Andrew Lloyd-Webber's 1978 classical fusion album Variations and also worked with him on musicals such as Cats and Starlight Express, composed incidental music for the David Jason detective series A Touch Of Frost and also plated flute on Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds.Thompson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1997 and retired as an active saxophonist in 2001 with a farewell tour. She returned to the stage in 2003 and featured at Colosseum's final live show at Shepherd's Bush Empire in 2015.";2022-07-10;https://www.loudersound.com/news/saxophonist-barbara-thompson-dead-at-77;2022-07-13;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDSAXOPHONISTBARBARATHOMPSONDEADAT77

And now the show's being shown on YouTube, with the express aim of raising funds for the UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency.   ""So many great memories of great times in Ukraine,"" wrote Brian May on Instagram, the day after Russian invasion of the country, sharing the crowd shot that now accompanies the YouTube footage. ""It seems unbelievable that the peaceful life of Ukraine could be so senselessly shattered in the 21st century. And it feels unbearable that the world could just watch and let it happen. We are all praying for peace for you, dear friends.""Freedom Square was struck by several Russian missiles in the first days of March during the ongoing Battle of Kharkiv. An estimated 600,000 people have been evacuated from the city. The 2008 show was free to attend – only those in the ""VIP zone"" paid for tickets – and was intended to raise awareness of the work of the Elena Pinchuk Foundation, launched in 2003 to fight against the AIDS epidemic in Ukraine. The first date of Queen + Paul Rodgers' Rock the Cosmos Tour, it was watched by 350,000 fans and an estimated television audience of 10 million, and was released the following year as the Live in Ukraine album and DVD.“We are very happy to do what we can to raise the awareness of AIDS and also to kick off a new tour,” Paul Rodgers told The Associated Press at the time. “Awareness is the first step towards defeating the problem.”“Queen lost its singer many years ago, so we know that this can affect anybody,” added drummer Roger Taylor.As well as May, Taylor and Rodgers, the lineup for the Kharkiv show also featured Jamie Moses (guitar, backing vocals) Danny Miranda (bass, backing vocals) and Spike Edney (keyboards, backing vocals).Donate to UNHCR.";2022-03-20;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-queen-paul-rodgers-play-historic-live-show-in-freedom-square-kharkiv-ukraine;2022-03-24;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDWATCHQUEEN+PAULRODGERSPLAYHISTORICLIVESHOWINFREEDOMSQUARE,KHARKIV,UKRAINE

louder;Gordon Giltrap's Iron Maiden connection;The prog/folk guitarist discusses logos, album titles, Nicko McBrain and more;"Gordon Giltrap isn't a name one would normally associate with heavy metal legends Iron Maiden. After all, he's more often associated with playing an acoustic guitar, and his albums are more likely to be found in the record collections of those who favour prog and folk music.But... Have a look at the logo on his 1977 album Fear of The Dark, below? Look familiar? These days the font is known as Metal Lord, but that was created in 1996, and is widely better known as the world famous Iron Maiden logo. Giltrap first used that logo on his 1976 album Visionary, which featured the hit single Heartsong. It was also used on the film poster for David Bowie's 1976 movie The Man Who Fell To Earth.The Giltrap/Maiden connection extends further. Not only did Iron Maiden release an album entitled Fear Of The Dark in 1992, but Maiden drummer Nick McBrain is not only one of Giltrap's old friends, but also drummed on Giltrap's 1973 release Giltrap.Speaking in the new issue of Prog, Gordon Giltrap speaks about the connection.""Nicko is an old friend of mine, and played on the Giltrap album,"" he tells prog writer Mike Barnesin the new issue's The Prog Interview. ""In fact, he nearly joined the Giltrap band. We didn't invent that font, but we used it from 1975 onwards. Yeah, Iron Maiden liked it. They also liked that [Fear Of The Dark] title. I was quite flattered, really.""You can read the whole of our new interview with Gordon in the new issue of Prog Magazine, which comes with an Art of Paul Whitehead 2023 Calendar, a 21-track Apollon records sampler and four Moody Blues post cards in the shops now, or online here (opens in new tab).(Image credit: The Electric Record Company)";2022-11-30;https://www.loudersound.com/news/gordon-giltraps-iron-maiden-connection;2022-11-30;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDGORDONGILTRAP'SIRONMAIDENCONNECTION

It’s out. And it’s out for blood…”""It’s an anthem for empathy,"" the trio say in a joint statement. ""For solidarity. Musically tense and withheld, erupting into angry cathartic crescendos. The push and pull of the song lyrically and musically expands and contracts, stating and calling out the double standards of power. Nobody really wins in a patriarchal society. We all lose. We could all use more empathy."" On Twitter, the band describe the release of the single as the start of a 'New Dream Wife era...'The opening lyrics of the song run:

'The leech is out for blood
The leech knows everyone and everyone seems to knows the leech
They wave and they smile politely with their false teeth while the heads and behinds are patted, the wine is poured, the endless drops of small talk is devoured
The gatekeepers, the so called legends
ya boys gonna let the girls play 
Or are they merely ornaments on display?'Speaking to NME, Icelandic vocalist Rakel Mjöll says, ""It was really important that Leech was the first song we shared because it’s such a heavy statement. The lyrics are incredibly truthful and personal. It’s a collective shared experience between the three of us, as we look backward as well as forwards.""

""I think it’s so exciting,"" she adds. ""It’s true, it’s raw, and it’s rock. I’ve had it with being polite.""

What does reality even look like? Can you tell a difference?""Talking about Intersubjective, Seidel adds: “These songs are an invitation to explore human identity in this rapidly digitised world we live in.

""Glass Hammer fans really locked on to the protagonist, really wanted to know more about him--and so did I. The plan is to spread his story out over four volumes, the first of which was just published.""The first few chapters will remind readers of classic sword and sorcery novels. Sword fights, sorcerers, a damsel in distress, a sentient sword--all the tropes are there. But it goes way deeper than tropes. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald and Lord Dunsany are as much an inspiration to me as are the likes of Michael Moorcock and Robert E. Howard. As it is with our music, so it is with my writing--all of my influences are at work within the book. But the music hasn't been abandoned. Glass Hammer is already at work on the third and final Skallagrim album!""Excerpt: “And those monsters saw not a young man with a sword but a scarred and screaming horror with the rising red doom of the sun at his back and a hellishly shrieking, flashing, living sword in his hands.Babb continues describing the novel's premise: ""How would you feel if you woke up in the middle of a fight for your life with only the vaguest idea of who you are? You're about to be slain by an angry mob of cutthroats, and the love of your life is being kidnapped right before your eyes. Strange; you can't remember her name. Looks like someone has stolen your memory too!""That's how Skallagrim begins his epic saga. And though he will wield a sentient, screaming sword that falls from the sky, and mysterious allies come to his aid, ultimately, Skallagrim must endure a nightmare journey alone. His quest—find the girl and kill the sorcerous fiend that stole her. Driving him on is the certain knowledge that he only has four days to rescue his love before she dies.

Production was handled by Rick Rubin, who completed a return to the cast behind the hugely successful Blood Sugar Sex Majik, By The Way, Californication and Stadium Arcadium albums. “Our only goal is to get lost in the music,” say the band. “We (John, Anthony, Chad and Flea) spent thousands of hours, collectively and individually, honing our craft and showing up for one another, to make the best album we could."" You can read more from the reborn Chilii Peppers in the new issue of Classic Rock, which is in UK stores now and available to buy online. (Image credit: Future)";2022-03-07;https://www.loudersound.com/news/red-hot-chili-peppers-flea-in-hair-metal-was-fking-great-shocker;2022-03-09;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERSOUNDREDHOTCHILIPEPPERS'FLEAIN""HAIRMETALWASF**KINGGREAT!""SHOCKER"
louder;"Type O Negative will never have a reunion, insists drummer Johnny Kelly, but he believes that Pete Steele's work ""deserves some kind of celebration""";"Type O Negative drummer Johnny Kelly says it would be ""impossible"" for the band to have a reunion without the late Pete Steele";"Johnny Kelly has squashed the idea of a potential Type O Negative reunion, based off his belief that it would be ""impossible"" without the band's late frontman Peter Steele.While speaking with Germany's Sonic Seducer magazine, the former Type O drummer is asked whether there's a chance of the industrial goth rockers reconnecting for a tour in honour of Steele, a question possibly prompted by next year's Pantera reunion plans. 

In response, Kelly says: ""I don't know if I would ever wanna do something like take it on the road or… It could never be a reunion; Peter's not there, so it's impossible to call it a reunion.""I think that Peter's work deserves some kind of celebration,"" he continues. ""And how that can happen, I really have no idea. But we've never seriously considered doing any kind of reunion or putting something out there as Type O Negative without Peter. Peter, his musicianship, his character — without him there, you can't call it Type O Negative.""Earlier this year, Kelly revealed that there had been various conversations about a  tribute concert for the vocalist, although the idea never grew into a serious possibility. ""There was never any serious consideration, like, should we do something? Is there even a point of doing it? Or also, is it just a blatant cash grab? So all these things go through your head"" he told Loaded Radio.""People celebrate [Peter] all the time,"" he added. ""They do it daily. I see it online all the time and the impact that he had.""Maybe somewhere down the road there may be something that's… I don't know. But I know that for me, it would have to include Kenny [Hickey, guitar] and Josh [Silver, keyboards] as well. Anything that we do, it would have to be the three of us. And there's no way you're getting Josh to do anything like that."".As for who would perform on vocal duties, he proposes the idea of a female vocalist, so that there would be no chance in having the new singer unfairly compared to Steele.""I'd want a girl to do it. I'd want a female vocalist — like Ann Wilson [Heart] or something like that"" he said. ""But even so, that's the first thing. When you think about doing some kind of tribute show, you're just gonna get all these people… Yes, Peter was very highly regarded by our peers and stuff like that, and you'll just get a bunch of dudes up there just trying to sound like Peter. And you can't do that. And it's, like, all right, so what's the most remote thing from Peter? You'd have to do something completely abstract.""And I would say get a female vocalist. I think Peter would get a kick out of… He would get off on seeing a girl sing his songs, seeing a female sing them. And it would really stress the point of doing something as a tribute instead of trying to recreate something.""Listen to the full interview with Sonic Seducer below:";2022-11-11;https://www.loudersound.com/news/type-o-negative-will-never-have-a-reunion-insists-drummer-johnny-kelly-but-he-believes-that-pete-steeles-work-deserves-some-kind-of-celebration;2022-11-13;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDERSOUNDTYPEONEGATIVEWILLNEVERHAVEAREUNION,INSISTSDRUMMERJOHNNYKELLY,BUTHEBELIEVESTHATPETESTEELE'SWORK""DESERVESSOMEKINDOFCELEBRATION"""

At the same time the band have announced that they have signed to Big Big Train's record label English Electric Recordings and will release their second album, Firmament, on September 2.“We decided not to include [Mare] on (debut album) Flown, but when Håkon (Høiberg, guitarist and writer of Mare) attempted to rearrange it in the style of Brian Wilson circa Pet Sounds we thought the result sounded inspired,"" explains singer and keyboard player Oskar Holldorff. ""The lyric was reworked right up until the recording and is about trying to break free of invisible shackles and the yearning for something more. We tried to balance the earnest expression of emotions with more obscure imagery, but achieving the right blend took a lot of time and effort.”“We are delighted to announce that we have signed Dim Gray,"" adds Big Big Train bassist Greg Spawton. ""Until now, the label has just been a vehicle for Big Big Train and outside projects of BBT band members. We have been interested in expanding the label’s activities for some time but only wanted to do so when we came across a truly exciting band that we felt had something new to offer musically. When we were introduced to Dim Gray, we saw that the band has enormous potential and were very keen to sign them.”Joining Høiberg and Holldorff is drummer Tom Ian Klungland. The band all moved from different parts of Norway to Oslo a decade ago to study. They released their debut album Flown in 2020.Oskar Holldorff will be touring as part of Big Big Train for a set of already announced dates in September 2022, deputising for BBT keyboard player Carly Bryant.Firmament will be available on CD, LP (via Plane Groovy) and all digital services, with the physical formats available to pre-order now via Burning Shed.Pre-order Firmament.(Image credit: English Electric Recordings)DIm Gray: Firmament

Is there a new album on the way? Possibly. All we know is these new songs are thematically linked: they share similar artwork, all displaying different variants of some kind of mythical, dystopian warlord, and underneath each single announcement on social media is the word 'worship'.Whatever they're up to, we know it'll be worth waiting for. As for what listeners think of their third release, one fan writes underneath the official YouTube video: ""Sleep Token really just be dropping songs and transcending genres like its a game on easy mode, absolutely beautiful"". Another says, ""It's not even fair for the other bands, Sleep Token already won the album of the year, and it's not even out yet. We're only in January. They're going to dominate this entire year, and I can't tell how happy I am for this! Worship.""Earlier this week, the band kicked off their UK tour on January 17 in Birmingham. Following their show yesterday in Glasgow, tonight they'll be heading off to Manchester, before they grace Bristol on January 21, and sign off for one last gig on January 22 in Hammersmith's Apollo (moved from Brixton Academy).Listen to Granite below:Sleep Token UK tour dates:Jan 19 Manchester Albert Hall

louder;Tool play (near) career-spanning set in first show in almost two years;Prog metal kings Tool play their first set in almost two years covering (almost) their entire discography;Prog metal titans Tool kicked off their 2022 world tour last night in Eugene, Oregon, playing their first show since they were first forced to cancel tour dates due to the pandemic. The 670-day wait seems to have been worth it though, the scant few videos and images shared from the evening showing the kinds of kaleidoscopic imagery we've come to love and expect from the band. Check out the image and clip below for a taste:A post shared by 【 T O O L 】 | تــــول (@toolbandfanpage)A photo posted by on While the production values are decidedly higher than in the band's rehearsal footage released earlier this week, just hearing those mesmeric melodies is enough to send shivers up the spine. Though the band only played 13 songs (a downside to having songs whose average run-time seldom dips below the five-minute mark), they nonetheless managed an (almost) career-spanning set, covering material from 1992's Opiate EP right up to 2019's Fear Inoculum. In fact, the only era not covered in the set is the band's debut album Undertow, which will turn 30 next year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the tour had first been mooted in promotion of the album, Fear Inoculum songs dominated the set, accounting for almost 50% of songs played. While no Undertow-era material made an appearance, the band did slip some (relative) rarities into the set, playing Pushit and Hooker With A Penis for the first time since 2014, while the 10,000 Days epic Right In Two made an appearance for the first time in over a decade. Tool are set to make their return to the UK in May, playing arenas as part of a wider European tour which kicks off in Copenhagen on April 23 and ends in Budapest on May 24. Tool's UK shows will be their first indoor headline dates since 2007, when they played a trio of shows in London and Manchester. The band headlined Download Festival in 2019, 13 years since their last appearance. Check out the setlist from their first show back (and some more choice fan videos and images) below:Tool setlist @ Matthew Knight Arena, Eugene, Oregon 10/01/2022Fear InoculumOpiateThe PotPushitPneumaThe GrudgeRight In TwoHooker With A PenisDescendingChocolate Chip TripEon Blue ApocalypseThe PatientInvincibleA post shared by Gary Calicott (@garycalicottphoto)A photo posted by on A post shared by Mike Alarcon (@aenima46n2)A photo posted by on A post shared by MK Summer (@mksummer27)A photo posted by on That’s a wrap in Eugene. pic.twitter.com/MOYMaZoyJoJanuary 11, 2022See moreAmazing @Tool show tonight in Eugene.

The anniversary has not gone unnoticed by the singer however, who kicked off the first date of his 20 Years Of Fear tour at the Launch Pad in Albuquerque with a tribute to his former Murderdolls bandmate Joey Jordison. ""This part of the show I'd like to make some noise for our brother Joey Jordison - he left us far too soon,"" the singer says. ""He was one of the most talented people I ever met and he's the reason any of you guys know who I am. So we picked a couple of songs, some of my favorite songs we liked to play with Joey.""The band then played Nowhere from Murderdolls' 2010 record Women And Children Last, Wednesday shouting ""for Joey!"" to screams of approval as the song kicks in. Joey Jordison had recruited Wednesday in late 2001 to a side-project he was working on while Slipknot were taking a break. Wednesday initially joined as a bassist, but soon pivoted to fronting the new band, soon dubbed Murderdolls.Cannibalising songs that had initially been written for Wednesday's former band Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13, the pair wrote much of the material that would make up Murderdolls' debut album Beyond The Valley Of The Murderdolls. Released on August 20, 2002, the album brought Wednesday 13 to audiences around the world and when Murderdolls went on hiatus in 2004, the singer launched a successful solo career. Murderdolls reunited again in 2010 and released Women And Children Last in August that year. The following year the band split for a second time, but talks for a reunion were still on-going as late as 2018. Jordison passed away in his sleep unexpectedly in July 2021 from unspecified causes. As former drummer of Slipknot as well as founder of Murderdolls and all-round icon, Jordison had a profound impact on heavy metal and tributes flooded in from across the metal world. At the time, Wednesday 13 posted a Tweet saying ""you changed my life forever"". Wednesday 13 is currently on the 20 Years Of Fear tour of the US. The show in Albuquerque was his first since Halloween 2020 and was billed as 'a career spanning setlist', including songs originally written for Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13 and Murderdolls. The 20 Years Of Fear tour is set to travel across the US until May, when the band will take a few weeks off before heading over to Europe for festival dates (including the UK's Download Festival in June). Wednesday 13 setlistScream Baby Scream

louder;This crowd-surfing, power metal-loving security guard is the greatest thing you’ll see today;This video of a security guard joyously crowd-surfing to ‘dwarven metal’ band Wind Rose will improve your day a thousand per cent;Being a security guard at a metal show is a tough gig, On the one hand, you spend a couple of hours trying to make sure a bunch of sweaty, loud, occasionally drunken fans have a good time without smashing up the venue, each other or themselves. On the other, you have pretty much stand in front of a bunch of deafening amps with your back to the band for a couple of hours. And if you’re not a fan of the music? Oof, that can’t be good.Luckily, there are some security guards who get total job satisfaction from what they do. Case in point: this unnamed, hi-vis hero who was captured on camera  throwing himself into his work by crowd surfing across the heads of the audience during ‘dwarven metal’ nerks Wind Rose’s set at Portugal’s Vagos Metal Fest festival.We’re not sure what we love about it the most: the look of joy on his face as he’s propelled around the crowd while the throwing the horns or the fact that he was caught by another security guard at the end.

louder;Listen to Midas Fall's powerful cover of Radiohead's Creep;Prog Award winning Scottish post-rock duo Midas Fall will release Covers EP in April;"Prog Award winning Scottish post-rock duo Midas Fall have shared their striking cover of Radiohead's Creep, which you can listen to below.It's taken from the band's upcoming EP Covers, which, as its title implies, features the band's unique reimaginings of other people's songs. Along with Creep the band also take on Bruce Springsteen's Dancing In The Dark and Placebo's Every You Every Me.The idea was conceived by singer Elizabeth Heaton while taking a break from writing the band's fifth album, the follow-up to 2018's Evaporate.""Creep, along with the other tracks on the upcoming EP were created during lockdown,"" says Heaton.. We took some of our favourite tracks from growing up and gave them a different feel. As a teenager Radiohead were the first band to make me feel that music could be something more, so have been a massive influence to me musically, especially when I first started writing. I was listening to Creep and imagined it played in a waltz style time signature. With the aid of my keyboard and a glass of wine the vocals seemed to flow very easily and were captured in a single take. From there it grew arms and legs.""Covers will be released digitally worldwide by Monotreme Records on April 7.

Lizzo - real name Melissa Viviane Jefferson - spontaneously burst into an a cappella cover of Rammstein's hallmark anthem Du Hast, originally released on the Berliners' sophomore 1997 album Sehnsucht, pretty much breaking the internet in the process.Proving that her unlikely nod to the German greats was no one-off, however, Lizzo went one better at a show at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin last night (February 28), performing a full-on cover of the track, complete with beefed-up backing music from her live band.""You better sing that shit!"" demands the singer in a since-posted clip, adding a hearty ""Y'all ready to go fucking crazy?!"" as the cover kicks into fifth gear and those unmistakeable riffs begin pealing out. Leading the way with an onslaught of jumps, headbangs and, yes, booty shakes, it's a spectacle surely even Till and the boys would be proud of.Watch the video of the delightful cover below. Presumably this all means we eventually get a video of Till twerking to About Damn Time when Rammstein hit the road for another European stadium show this summer.A post shared by Lizzo (@lizzobeeating) (opens in new tab)A photo posted by on Rammstein 2023 European tour datesMay 22: Vilnius Vingio Parkas, Lithuania

louder;Watch fired-up Bloodstock Festival punters stage a chaotic wheelie bin jousting tournament;This is the kind of gloriously foolish buffoonery we expect nothing less from metal fans at metal festivals;"Ah metal festivals, the perfect escape from the nine to five and the monotonous, mundane slog of everyday living. Good music, community spirit, and a shared interest in letting go of common decency in lieu of batshit buffoonery. What could be better?This weekend, Bloodstock Festival graced the heat-scorched grounds of Catton Park in Derbyshire once again, bringing the faithful performances from Mercyful Fate, Testament, Lamb Of God, Jinjer, Killing Joke, and even a secret set from Machine Head.And of course, the fun didn’t end when the headline acts finished their sets, for that’s when the silent discos and DJs tents kicked in. Alternatively, some festival-goers made their own fun, as demonstrated in this TikTok video (posted by @mallimetalheadmalpass) which sees a crowd urging on two blokes who are trying their very best to revive the mobile tradition of jousting with the aid of two huge wheelie bins. If you’re not familiar with the mediaeval pastime, jousting is when two knights charge at each other on horseback while wielding big sticks called lances in hope of hitting each other as hard as possible. In the footage, enthusiastic onlookers assemble as two men try to balance on the bins before smashing into each other and, of course, falling off. It’s no easy feat to get a non-motorised wheelie bin to move however, so to get some momentum, plenty of pals are present to boost them along with vigorous speed. Wonderful. What are friends for, eh?Bin jousting at Bloodstock has become something of a tradition over the years, and in the video, it’s dubbed the “strictly unofficial sporting event” of the festival. One user writes: “Bloodstock wouldn’t be the same if there wasn’t bin jousting! A few times I thought it was thunder haha”, while another remarks: “I remember this from 2011. I had a man in a banana suit and a pirate flyover my tent”.Check out the video below:

After all, isn't that what the holidays are all about: throwing your cautions to the wind and acting like a turkey-stuffed buffoon? We think so, at least.In keeping with our need for end-of-year mayhem (if you can't let your hair down at this time of year, when can you?), we've come across Psychostick's parody of Rob Zombie's Dragula, helmed by one very creepy Zombie Santa. For the song, the comedy metal band have swapped out Rob Zombie's macabre lyrics for something a little more Xmassy, complete with menacing elves, a giant nutcracker, strange reindeer masks, scantily clad models, guitar fights, explosions and lots of chunky riffs. In keeping with the original Dragula video, the Zombie (Santa) also rides around manically on some sort of devilish joy-ride, but this time through wintery landscapes and snow covered trees. 'Maker of the list, gonna check it twice, gonna find out if you're naughty or nice', and 'let them sugar plums dance inside your head, I may watch you sleep, as you lay in bed', are just a few of the seasonal (and kind of creepy) this un-dead Santa sings. If Rob Zombie isn't your bag, then Psychostick have other similarly amusing creations to check out, such as this Drowning Pool Bodies parody I Can Only Count To Four, which is pretty popular with tots on TikTok.Watch the Rob Zombie parody below:;2022-12-22;https://www.loudersound.com/news/this-band-has-reimagined-rob-zombies-dragula-as-a-christmas-song-and-its-surprisingly-creepyfestive;2022-12-25;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDTHISBANDHASREIMAGINEDROBZOMBIE'SDRAGULAASACHRISTMASSONGANDIT'SSURPRISINGLYCREEPY/FESTIVE

louder;Someone received over 1000 emails meant for Bring Me The Horizon’s Oli Sykes because they have the same name;Author Oliver Sykes has revealed how he spent so much of his time replying to Bring Me The Horizon fans who had mistaken his email for that of their lead singer.;"Oliver Sykes, an author from Manchester, has revealed how for a period of time, in 2008, he received upwards of 1000 emails from Bring Me The Horizon fans thinking that he was their lead singer Oli Sykes.

In a piece written for Metro, Oliver has spoken about how back when he was 16, he created his first email address as Oli_sykes@msn.com. Then in 2008, whilst at university, and around the time that BMTH released their second album, Suicide Season, he started receiving emails from fans saying how much they loved the band. 

And though some were just general well-wishes, others were a bit more personal and vulnerable. ""A case of mistaken identity isn’t exactly a walk in the park, but what was harder was reading the content of some of these emails,"" he explains. ""By nature of the record’s name, these vulnerable young people who had connected with Oli started telling me about their mental health and really intimate parts of their lives. I was a student and completely unequipped to help or do anything about it, but I couldn’t just leave them unread – not when they were baring so much of themselves.""

This resulted in Oliver replying as best he could to everybody, stating that he wasn't the Oli Sykes that they thought he was but wishing them the best. But the messages increased to a point where 40-50 were arriving every week, and he was spending more time on replying than on the degree that he was studying for.

""There were the people who would respond to my messages from the early days with, ‘This must be the real Oli Sykes because otherwise, why would you answer?’ or, ‘I can’t believe that you’ve answered me, and I know you’re saying you’re not Oli Sykes, but you are. I know you are, in my heart of hearts. And I just want to say thank you so much’,"" he continues. ""I tried not to get into back and forths with people, but it did happen, and it did eat away at my time. All in all, it gave me a flavour of what it’s like to be truly famous, and I realised I didn’t want it. 

Though by the time 2010 rolled around and the band's third album, There Is A Hell, Believe I've Seen It. There Is A Heaven, Let's Keep It A Secret was released, Oliver's inbox was a lot quieter. But now, with his first children's book Alfie's First Fight, coming out, he is asking if Oli might be able to return the favour 15 years later.

""What would be great, is if Oli Sykes could get on board and help promote it as payback for all the admin I did for him 15 years ago,"" he finishes. ""It would definitely help me out, considering that when anyone Googles my name, all they find is search results about him!""

This new reimagned version of the album includes 15 minutes of bonus material from the original  sessions - the tracks Heads, Talos Aetern, an extended opening  introduction to Talos plus The Alpha And The Omega which was recorded  at the same time but used on a Cyclops Sampler album instead. Remastered and re-ordered, the album now opens with the three part suite The Return Of John Deth.""I decided to start remastering my six Karda Estra albums that were originally released on the Cyclops label between 2001 and 2009 as I know I can achieve a much better sound these days than I got back then,"" expains Wileman. ""The Age Of Science And Enlightenment, from 2006, is one of my favourites and while revisiting the archives, I discovered all sorts of sketch recordings that allowed me to make an expanded edition. All extra work was post production, not a single new note or sound was recorded as I wanted to stay historically true to the original.""With all this, plus the non-album track The Alpha And The Omega and a re-sequencing of the track running order, I think I've really been able to present this album in it's very best light. In many ways, this album feels to me like the end of the first stage of Karda Estra where I really pushed myself as a composer exploring my interest of mixing prog/art rock and classical instruments with all sorts of gothic, surreal influences. I knew at the time this felt like some kind of peak and from that point onwards, I started bringing in more diverse influences.""The album, which features new artwork which you can see below, was composed, arranged and produced by Wileman, who also plays classical, electric and bass guitars, keyboards and percussion, and also features Ileesha Bailey (vocals), Helen Dearnley (violin), Caron Hansford (oboe, cor anglais) and Zoë Josey (flute, alto and soprano saxophones).Pre-order The Age Of Science And Enlightenment.(Image credit: No Image Records)";2023-02-02;https://www.loudersound.com/news/karda-estra-reimagine-2006-album-the-age-of-science-and-enlightenment;2023-02-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERKARDAESTRAREIMAGINE2006ALBUMTHEAGEOFSCIENCEANDENLIGHTENMENT
louder;Watch Sebastian Bach rapping Outkast, Snoop Dogg and Run-DMC classics on one of the most surreal reality TV shows ever;The Skid Row legend showed a different side when he took part in Celebrity Rap Superstar in 2007...and he wasn't bad!;"We always appreciate the moments when a rock star works hard to push themselves out of their comfort zone, and we can think of few more stark examples of that than when heavy metal legend and former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach, explored his hip-hop credentials for a bizarre, mid-00s celebrity reality TV competition.Celebrity Rap Superstar premiered on MTV on August 30, 2007, and featured Bach alongside seven other celebs as they attempted to become competent rappers by taking on iconic hip hop songs from across the years. Bach was joined on the show by actresses Shar Jackson and Countess Vaughn, reality stars Kendra Wilson and Jason Wahler, celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton, NFL veteran Jamal Anderson and actor Efren Ramirez. Bach would even have legendary rapper Kurupt as his 'mentor', guiding him through the competition, with Run-DMC hero DMC, Chicago rapper Da Brat and respected radio host Big Boy serving as judges, eliminating one celebrity from the competition each week.As it happens, Bach had a hell of a run on the show, making it all the way to episode 7 and narrowly missing out on making the season final. His high point of the competition, though, was undoubtedly in week 6, when he took on classic Outkast anthem B.O.B., taken from the Atlanta duo's hugely influential 2000 album, Stankonia. Running along a guitar-licked, proto-drum 'n' bass beat, B.O.B. is comfortably Outkast's fastest and most energetic song, featuring some of the most intense raps Big Boi and André 3000 ever committed to tape. You might consider it a bold choice for a singer like Bach to cover, but he gives it a go and...actually...has a pretty fair stab at it!Watch the performance for yourself below.Bach acknowledged his B.O.B. rap this week on social media after a journalist dug out the clip on Twitter and noted: ""Sometimes I just randomly think about Sebastian Bach rapping Outkast’s Bombs Over Baghdad.""""So random I forgot I did that,"" replied Bach, ""right on Outkast turn it up.""Over the course of his stint on Celebrity Rap Superstar, Bach also rapped classics by LL Cool J, 2Pac, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg and Beastie Boys, as well as his own composition, titled One For The Money.

The single is set to feature on their forthcoming album This Is Why - as presented on its tracklist - which is scheduled for release on February 10, 2023.As she signs a burned copy of the track with it's title, she also writes the name 'gwizzle', which is reportedly the name of an eager fan who will be the recipient of the early preview. Alongside the signature, she writes out the date December 8, which is presumably when the single will be given an official release. Then, she places it inside a package ready to send in the post. The fan known as ""gwizzle"" has since responded to the TikTok, declaring: ""LITERALLY SITTING AT MY MAILBOX RIGHT NOW"", and ""Life is not real right now"".Although the clip is short, the single itself sees Williams resonate out a hypnotic vocal trill against a backing of jazzy alt rock, before it pauses, and a monotone collection of voices plainly says its title, 'the news'. Over the last few months, Paramore have been previewing sections of forthcoming songs on their TikTok and Discord accounts. Back in September, they teased a portion of a track which is still yet to be given a name.The alt-rockers shared the title-track of their new album, This Is Why, that same month, and have since been playing it on their recent US tour. Last month, Hayley Williams and co. announced a North American trek for 2023, with support from Foals, Bloc Party and more. The tour will kick off on May 23 and come to an end on August 2. In other news, they also recently changed the cover artwork for their 2013 self-titled album on streaming services. While the original image featured a photograph of the band, including former bassist Jeremy Davis, it's since been switched to a photo of just Williams, wearing a jacket printed with the words ""grow up"" on the back.Although no explanation was given for the change, some fans were speculating that it was to do with their legal dispute with Davis, who left Paramore in 2015, which was later settled out of court.

The text accompanying Clown's piece, Damage Inc. reads: 'Shawn 'Clown' Crash is best known as Slipknot's co-founder and percussionist. Crahan has directed music videos, helmed a film, and was primarily responsible for Slipknot's 2012 The Apocalyptic Nightmare photo book. 

""Sometimes I don't even like to admit that I'm 'an artist,' because then maybe I become a cliché, and then my hunger for it leaves,"" Crahan said. ""It's taken me twenty years to convince people what the word 'art' truly means. I use the word very loosely, since to me, it represents everything.""Crahan's mixed-media sculpture dedicated to Damage, Inc. was a striking centerpiece that anchored the Obey Your Master exhibition.'Gerard Way's contribution to the exhibit is accompanied by the following text:

'Lead vocalist and co-founder of My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way is also a comic writer and artist. A firm believer in the healing power of music, Gerard has described the mission statement of My Chemical Romance as such: ""The main thing that we've always wanted to do was to save people's lives. That sounds Mother Teresa-ish and outlandish, but it really does happen. It does make a huge difference. We've seen it in action.""Way's contribution to Obey Your Master was an installation of painted and fabricated landmines inspired by One. Way explained that his original idea ""was to get a pile of landmines to do as an installation. I asked a friend of mine to fabricate and cast a ton of these so they'd be cost-effective. Getting actual landmines, decommissioned or even replicas of landmines, is pretty much impossible. There were a couple of approaches I tried, but I decided upon a pile of destroyed, fragmented landmines.""You can watch footage of the exhibition below: 72 Seasons, Metallica's first studio album for almost seven years, is set for release on April 14 via the band's own Blackened imprint.

The 57 year-old is the first member of the band to publicly acknowledge the allegations.Posting on Instagram, Schneider writes (translated from German):

""I would like to share my personal emotions and thoughts with you.

The accusations of the last few weeks have deeply shaken us as a band and me as a person. You fans certainly too. I feel as if in shock by the things that have been shared on social media and in the press and in print about our singer. This is an ebb and flow of emotions for us band members and crew.

No, I don't think anything criminally relevant (such as the use of knockout drops) happened. No. I don't think anything illegal was going on, I've never seen anything like it, nor heard anything like it from any of our crew of 100 people. All I heard from Till's parties were adults celebrating together. And yet things seem to have happened that, although legally ok, I personally don't think are ok. Certain structures have grown that went beyond the limits and values of the other band members. It is also important to us that Till's parties are not confused with our official after-show parties.

Till has distanced himself from us in recent years and created his own bubble.
With their own people, their own parties, their own projects. That made me sad, definitely. I believe Till when he tells us that he always wanted and still wants to give his private guests a good time. How exactly these guests had imagined this, however, seems to differ in some cases from his own ideas. The wishes and expectations of the women who have now come forward were probably not fulfilled. According to their statements, they felt uncomfortable, on the edge of a situation that they could no longer control. I feel sorry for her and I feel compassion.

However, it is important for me to emphasize something objective: every guest in the backstage area is free to leave (they may have to wait a moment for security to lead them safely to the exit). All bottles are sealed and in full view of the guests freshly opened or they open them themselves.

Water and snacks are available just like Security personnel and medical care available at any time. We want all of our guests to feel comfortable and safe with us!
This is our standard. So I'm sorry to hear that some didn't feel that way.""Last month, Rammstein fan Shelby Lynn, from Ballymena, Northern Ireland, alleged that her drinks were spiked at a ‘pre-party’ in Lithunia on May 22, leaving her physically bruised and vomiting for more than 24 hours. Lynn also claimed that refusing to have sex with Till Lindemann during a meeting with the singer made the Rammstein frontman angry (she has emphasised that she was not sexually assaulted and that Lindemann never touched her).In the wake of Lynn's allegations, more women have come forward; on June 2, German outlet Tagesschau published allegations previously reported in Munich newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung accusing the singer of ""abuse of power and sexual assault"".Further allegations have since emerged on social media, with numerous women claiming that people close to Lindemann were involving in 'rounding up' female Rammstein fans, some of whom appeared to be drugged, to meet with the vocalist.German police have since opened an investigation into the accusations levelled against Lindemann. The singer has also lost his publishing contract with Kiepenheuer & Witsch, the company who released a collection of his poems in 2020.

Promotion for Rammstein's music has now been suspended by the band's label, Universal, who say in a statement: ""The accusations against Till Lindemann have shocked us and we have the greatest respect for the women who have spoken out so courageously in public in this case.""You can view Christoph Schneider's statement below:A post shared by Christoph Schneider (@christophschneider_official)A photo posted by on";2023-06-17;https://www.loudersound.com/news/rammstein-christoph-schneider-statement-till-lindemann;2023-06-18;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDER""THEACCUSATIONSOFTHELASTFEWWEEKSHAVEDEEPLYSHAKENUSASABAND"":RAMMSTEIN'SCHRISTOPHSCHNEIDERRELEASESSTATEMENTONALLEGATIONSMADEAGAINSTTILLLINDEMANN"

At the December 1971 show at the Montreaux Casino took place when an over-zealous fan fired a flare gun which burned the venue down, a feat immortalised in Deep Purple's Smoke On The Water (Purple were in town to record Machine Head). When the tour reached London, with Zappa and band playing borrowed gear as theirs had all been lost in the Montreaux fire), a crazed fan pushed Zappa off stage and into the orchestra pit at the first of two proposed shows at London's Rainbow Theatre which left him with serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed larynx.The new Super Deluxe Edition boxed set The Mothers 1971 showcases these special 1971 lineups and commemorates these storied chapters in Zappa’s legacy. Overseen by the Zappa Trust and produced by Ahmet Zappa and Zappa Vaultmeister Joe Travers, the 100-track, nearly 10-hour set brings together every note of the fabled four shows that closed down the vaunted Fillmore East in New York City on June 5-6, 1971, including the entire John Lennon and Yoko Ono encore, along with the full Rainbow Theatre performance in London, England, on December 10, 1971, and for the very first time anywhere, contains the official audio of the Rainbow Theatre show’s truly shocking ending which was thought to have not been recorded until recently discovered.The box set will be available on eight CDs or as a digital equivalent.

And one such star was Korn's own Fieldy, who in 2002 made his second appearance on the show around the release of the band's 5th album Untouchables. Shown as part of Season Five of the show, other notable appearances included blink-182’s Mark Hoppus, Gene Simmons, Sammy Hagar, Papa Roach’s Dave Buckner and Alien Ant Farm, so in very good company.

And what an incredible space Fieldy had to show off.

He starts his journey in his garage, which since his last appearance, has expanded from having the space for one car to 15. The highlights include the car used in the band's video for 'Got The Life', his Escalade with 23' rims added and an open-top white Rolls Royce which has a custom plug-in speaker in the boot. 

Then there's his studio, disco-balled up into the stratosphere and shining bright like several diamonds, littered with record plaques from the likes of Limp Bizkit and Staind. It's where he recorded his 2002 solo rap project Rock n Roll Gangster under Fieldy's Dreams as well.

“In the many years I’ve been working towards this moment, one of the things I discovered when it comes to bridging the hurdle of exposing people to Arizona wine is context,” he says.“So by putting a place like this in the middle of Cottonwood with five acres of vines, to winery facilities with a full greenhouse and a full kitchen, all the context becomes visible, and you kind of break down the barriers of whatever preconceptions you have of Arizona wines.”

The Merkin Vineyards Hilltop Winery & Trattoria will be open from 11am to 8pm Sundays through Thursdays, and from 11am to 10 pm on Fridays and Saturdays.The Merkin Vineyards Pocket Park Gelateria, meanwhile, will be open 11am to 7pm Sundays through Thursdays, and from 11am to 8 pm on Fridays/Saturdays.";2023-08-31;https://www.loudersound.com/news/tool-maynard-james-keenan-ice-cream-parlour;2023-09-03;9999-12-31;1;"LOUDER""I’VEBEENWORKINGTOWARDSTHISMOMENT"":TOOL'SMAYNARDJAMESKEENANISOPENINGANEWICECREAMPARLOUR,ATRATTORIA,AWINERYANDHISOWNTRAMLINE"
louder;Here are the 20 longest-charting albums in the history of the Billboard 200;Pink Floyd, Metallica, AC/DC and Nirvana classics are just some of the albums to have spent hundreds of weeks in the charts;"1. Pink Floyd – Dark Side of the Moon (1973)Since its upgrade from an initial weekly top 10 ranking to its iconic top 200 list in May 1967, the Billboard 200 has remained the definitive barometer for chart success in the music world. Over the ensuing decades, as physical sales have dwindled and the manner in which fans consume music has evolved, Billboard's status as a music industry powerhouse has remained intact, not least thanks to the enduring success of some of the most iconic albums in music history.Many major artists have seen certain albums remain on the Billboard 200 since their initial release - an incredible feat in some cases, given than some of these records have been out for twenty, thirty, forty years or more. With that in mind, here are the 20 current longest-charting albums on the Billboard 200, from rock legends to pop idols and more.Come September 2023, this particular Pink Floyd masterpiece topped the US album chart and will have dominated the Billboard 200 for a staggering 1000 weeks. This richly-layered, ambitious concept album has sold at least 45 million copies since its release in 1973, making it the biggest-selling album recorded by a British band. 2. Bob Marley & the Wailers – Legend (1984)Released three years after Bob Marley's death from cancer, Legend is a compilation of their hit singles released between 1972 and 1983. Including iconic tracks such as No Woman, No Cry, Buffalo Soldier, I Shot the Sheriff and Three Little Birds, it remains the best-selling reggae album of all time. As of March 1, 2023, Legend will been a fixture in the Billboard 200 for 771 weeks. 3. Journey – Greatest Hits (1988)Collating Journey's biggest singles released between 1977 and 1986, Greatest Hits has notched up 750 weeks in the Billboard 200 to date and has received a 15-times platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Featuring perennial favourites like Don’t Stop Believin’ and Any Way You Want It, Greatest Hits is positively heaving with AOR classics.4. Metallica – Metallica (1991)After the labyrinthine and exhaustively long songs on their 1988 album ...And Justice For All, Metallica returned to the studio with Mötley Crüe producer Bob Rock and signalled a shift in their approach to songwriting and the sonic weight of their recordings. Costing over $1 million to make, the results were immediate following the release of The Black Album in the summer of 1991. As the album nears 700 weeks in the Billboard 200, no other metal band has come within sniffing distance of Metallica's landmark album.5. Creedence Clearwater Revival – Chronicle (1976)Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits, to give it its full name, actually features 13 of the Creedence Clearwater Revival's singles – including Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising and Fortunate Son – and a handful of B-sides. This 1976 release follows two other compilations Creedence Gold and More Creedence Gold which emerged after the band's split in 1972. Chronicle, however, remains the band's biggest-selling release and has clocked up 627 weeks on the Billboard 200 charts as of March 1, 2023. 6. Eminem – Curtain Call: The Hits (2005)Curtain Call: The Hits collects Marshall Mathers's biggest releases recorded between 1997 and 2005. With singles such as My Name Is, Stan and Lose Yourself, this 2005 compilation earned the Detroit rapper his fifth consecutive US number 1 album. At the time of writing, the album has been a constant in the Billboard 200 for 617 weeks, making it one of the most successful rap albums of all time.  7. Nirvana – Nevermind (1991)Nirvana's follow-up to their 1989 debut Bleach, Nevermind was their first for a major label. Their lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit booted grunge into the mainstream and effectively ended hair metal with a wall of feedback. Following its release in September 1991, the huge success of the album spawned countless plaid-shirted imitators but have never been equalled. Nevermind has been in the Billboard 200 for over 600 weeks.8. Guns N’ Roses – Greatest Hits (2004)Seemingly released by Geffen as some sort of stop-gap because of the delays surrounding Chinese Democracy, this compilation was met with resistance by members of Guns N' Roses who filed lawsuits against the label in a bid to halt its release. With tracks cherry-picked from Appetite for Destruction, GN'R Lies and Use Your Illusion I and II, The Spaghetti Incident? and their cover of The Rolling Stones' Sympathy for the Devil, this compilation has occupied a spot in the Billboard 200 for over 600 weeks. 9. Bruno Mars – Doo Wops & Hooligans (2010)Bruno Mars' critically-acclaimed debut album was released in late 2010. It has sold over 15 million copies around the world and its masterful blend of pop, R&B, soul and rock has earned the Honulu-born singer-songwriter five Grammy nominations along the way. Doo Wops & Hooligans was the ninth album to reach the 500-week mark and has remained in the Billboard 200 for 609 weeks thus far.10. Michael Jackson – Thriller (1982)Thriller – Michael Jackson's sixth studio album – is the best-selling album of all-time, won eight Grammys and has been certified 34 times platinum by the RIAA. Produced by Quincy Jones, the nine-track album contained seven hit singles, including Beat It (which features the late Eddie Van Halen on guitar), his duet with Paul McCartney on The Girl Is Mine and the eponymous title track, which was accompanied by the iconic video which cost an estimated $500,000 to make. Despite its astonishing sales, the album has been in the Billboard 200 for 559 weeks. And here's a rundown of 11-20...11. AC/DC – Back in Black (1980) – 553 weeks
12. Adele – 21 (2011) – 549 weeks
13. Kendrick Lamar – Good Kid m.A.A.d City (2012) – 536 weeks

louder;"Yes, Lars Ulrich reads online comments about Metallica's music: ""I challenge anybody in a band to say they don't""";Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich admits that he had a cheeky look online to see what people were saying about the band's first single in seven years, Lux Æterna;"Metallica drummer and band co-founder Lars Ulrich has admitted that he is occasionally prone to breaking that sacred rule of keeping one's sanity on the internet: he reads social media comments about his work.Speaking to Metal Hammer as part of our brand new cover interview, Ulrich explains that when the metal legends released rollocking comeback single Lux Æterna late last year, he couldn't resist the opportunity to sneak a look online to see what what fans were saying about their new music. “If you decide to go down into the comment sections, at least for me, you have to prepare yourself for not taking any of it overly personally,” Lars says. “You have to kind of remove yourself from it. But I’d like to challenge anybody in a band to say they don’t look at comments.”“I mean, I’m not sitting up until four o’clock in the morning scrolling through every one,” he adds. “But when you haven’t put any music out in five or six years and you dump something like Lux Æterna on an unsuspecting world, you’re going to want to see what the feedback is.”Hilariously, as it turns out, Robert Trujillo got great feedback on Lux Æterna almost immediately - so quickly, in fact, that it came before Metallica's bassist even knew that the band had released the single.“I started getting texts the next morning from friends: ‘Wow, the new song’s amazing, the video’s awesome,’” he says. “I didn’t even know that the song was coming out. So maybe the success of keeping it a secret is some of the members not knowing.”Elsewhere in the interview, Metallica also discuss the challenges of creating candid, conceptually loaded new album 72 Seasons in the middle of the pandemic, why they feel Lux Æterna's influences might not be as obvious as you'd think and being unafraid showing their vulnerable side as they get older and wiser. Well, at least mostly wiser - even Lars admits he has days where he feels ""like a fucking idiot.""Read all that and more only in the new issue of Metal Hammer.

Meanwhile, a chugging rhythm drives the track forward, with Cooper regally musing about life on the road and his theatrical live shows.“For Road, I wanted the band to be involved in the foundation of all the songs,” says Cooper, speaking of his longtime bandmembers Ryan Roxie, Chuck Garric, Tommy Henrikson, Glen Sobel, and Nita Strauss. “I only see these guys when we’re on the road. So, I wanted them to be as tight as they are for the show but on all new material. When you have a band this good, I believe in showing it off, and this is my way of doing so.”Road will be purchasable in a wide variety of formats and limited vinyl colours.

That'll be ONE MILLION POUNDS please sucker;"A luxury fashion house is cashing in on nostalgia for the 1990s by selling second-hand Nirvana T-shirts at prices that would have thrift-shop devotee Kurt Cobain turning in his grave. As part of their The Vintage collection, Saint Laurent are offering bog-standard grunge merchandise items at what one might perhaps consider 'piss-take prices': having recently sold an Incesticide album cover design T-shirt for a staggering £3295 ($4200), the site is currently flogging the same design for $ 4,450 (£3,485) with complimentary shipping, an In Utero cover design shirt for $ 2,690 (£2106), and a classic 'Fudge Packin Crack Smokin Satan Worshippin Mother Fucker' shirt for the bargain price of $1,390 (£1,089). Naturally, these prices have caused something of a stir. Former Sonic Youth bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon, longtime friends with Nirvana, posted a story about the collection on instagram with the caption, ""Sick! So punk!"". Referencing the 1991 Dave Markey-filmed documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, which featured a 1991 Sonic Youth/Nirvana tour of Europe, one clever comment below Gordon's Instagram post reads 'The year Punk made me Broke.""Speaking to The Guardian, Jacob McMurray, who curated 'Nirvana: Taking Punk To The Masses' an exhibition of grunge memorabilia at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture in 2018, says “[Grunge is] 30 years ago, so there’s this nostalgia around it.

It's the first new music to be taken from her upcoming album Elevation, which will be released through SusannaSonata on March 25.Like her 2020 release Baudelaire & Piano, Elevation has been inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. When Susanna read the first verse of Charles Baudelaire's poem Alchemy of Suffering she experienced immediate recognition: 

Nature, one man lend you fire,
Another dulls you with his grief.
What says to one: Here is the grave,
Says to the other: Glory, Life!""The video for Alchemy of Suffering is filmed and edited by cloak/dagger. The idea for the video is inspired by live presence, featuring dreamlike elements,"" she explains.As with Baudelaire & Piano, Elevation features work by American occultist artist Cameron (1922-1995), an adherent of Aleister Crowley’s Thelema movement. Her illustrations Witch Woman, Pan and Danse adorn the release, which will be available on cassette as well as in the usual digital, CD and vinyl formats.The album sees Susanna once again work with tape recordist Stina Stjern, who also worked on Susanna’s 2019 Hieronymous Bosch project Garden of Earthly Delights.(Image credit: SusannaSonata)Susanna: Elevation

After peaking at 2053ppm on takeoff the air filets kick in and it drops back to 1340, before rising slowly again.“Due to these onboard CO2 readings I highly recommend masking with an N95/KN95 mask on flights,” Dr Kat concludes, and said Blythe was the “best research assistant ever!”Lamb Of God just announced new album Omens, and they’ll release lead track Nevermore tomorrow (June 10). “The world is crazy and keeps changing,” Blythe said of the follow-up to 2020’s self-titled record. “Omens is a reaction to the state of the world,. It’s a very pissed-off record. It is extremely pissed-off.” Guitarist Mark Morton added: “The inner workings of the band have never been better.

The band signed to ZTT and released their acclaimed debut album A Secret Wish in 1985. Despite hit singles such as Dr. Mabuse and Duel, the band's career became embroiled in legal wrangles and they split in 1990.The four key members, Brücken, Freytag, Dorper and Michael Mertens, have reunited sporadically over the years. This current activity from vocalists Brücken and Freytag came about after the pair performed two sold-out shows at the Grarage as xPropaganda in 2018, and followed it up by convening with Lipson to begin writing new material“We always thought it was a shame that an album as distinctive and acclaimed as A Secret Wish seemed destined to be a one-off.

We had that bit of a lay-off with Blondie at the time, and even though we were so successful I was still trying to get something else going, just to keep playing, and that’s been my MO ever since.”And why did this mind-boggling Pistols/Blondie/Jam/Rollers supergroup band not materialise in the end? Burke can’t quite recall what went wrong – though alcohol may have had something to do with it.“I’m not exactly sure what happened with that band, but I know we spent a lot of afternoons in The Roebuck [pub] on the King’s Road,” explains Burke.Burke and Matlock have more in common than just being part of punk’s first wave - both men played in Iggy Pop’s band at different times. In the same interview, Matlock reveals that he once got roasted by Iggy after drinking at a gig.“The first time I went to New York I was playing with Iggy and we headlined the Palladium on Halloween [1979], with The Cramps supporting us, and I did like a brown ale back then,” he says. “Iggy read me the riot act: ‘The American people will not stand for this kind of behaviour…’ You know, Iggy Pop telling me off,can you imagine? It was probably because I was winding him up about getting on a bit.”Burke and Matlock finally got to play together in The International Swingers in the early 2010s and again in 2017 as part of L.A.M.F., a tribute to former New York Dolls guitarist and New York punk icon Johnny Thunders.Now they’ve reunited once more in Lust For Life, a band made up of former Iggy Pop band alumni fronted by TV presenter-turned-singer Katie Puckrick.

A bargain, perhaps. And for those with deeper pockets, the bidding on some of those signed Cure albums is already heading towards the £1000 mark.  The auction catalogue is available online, and fans can either bid online or register to join the live auction, which takes place tomorrow (June 6) at 10am UK time. ""As ever, we are grateful to all the artists, their labels and teams for making the event possible with their generous support,"" says Johnny Chandler, A&R Director at Universal Music Recordings, who founded the White Label Auction, ""and hope to generate as much as we can to help the Trust continue its valuable work.” Proceeds from the auction - which raised £44,000 last year – go to the BRIT Trust, the charity established by the UK record industry in 1989 that supports hundreds of causes around the country, including The BRIT School, East London Arts & Music, the Nordoff & Robbins music therapy charity and many more.";2023-06-05;https://www.loudersound.com/news/white-label-auction-2023;2023-06-08;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERRAREWHITELABELSFROMLEDZEPPELIN,THINLIZZY,THEWHOANDMANYMOREGOUNDERTHEHAMMER

The track was originally recorded by Hues and his fusion outfit The Quartet and members of Canterbury proggers Syd Arthur in 2912 and released in 2019.The track is taken from a new double live album, Epigonal Quark, which will be released on November 19. The album was recorded on a 2019 tour to promote the release of Nobody's Fault But My Own, which also saw Hues and his band, which featured members of Syd Arthur, performing live renditions of music by Soft Machine, Robert Wyatt, Talk Talk, Radiohead and more.""We recorded Nobody’s Fault... in an old, converted garage in Harbledown near Canterbury. Miles and Teo Macero were the inspiration, splicing sections from takes where the tape kept rolling, recording everything. Rationalise it later. And lots of people got it, prog-heads and jazz-heads,"" says Hues.“Nobody’s Fault... is 95% improvised. My guitar solo - I have no idea how I played it and I certainly couldn’t play it again the same way. Improvisation is reaction, reaction to what the band is playing, the atmosphere in the room, what you just played, what that suggests, the split-second reaction to the nuance of this note, that tone, you exist in that split second reacting to impulses beyond your rational mind - submerged in the moment-by-moment relationships of you, the one, to the whole.“Myrrhman and Sea Song follow the song structures but expand them, push outwards, fall inwards. Improvisation is like The Big Bang - all those years of practicing, playing, sounding, learning, exploring, absorbing exist in an infinitely compressed moment that then releases, explodes, realises itself - on a good night.""Epigonal Quark will be available to pre-order from Hues' Bandcamp page shortly.";2022-09-03;https://www.loudersound.com/news/jack-hues-shares-epic-live-version-of-becks-nobodys-fault-but-my-own;2022-09-04;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDJACKHUESSHARESEPICLIVEVERSIONOFBECK'SNOBODY'SFAULTBUTMYOWN

It put the new drummer in a difficult position – and some of the band members weren’t as much help as they could have been.“I had to listen to those songs a lot,” Appice told Vinyl Writer Music. “I tried to play like Bill in some spots, but in other areas, I just played like me, because that’s what I felt.“Bill has a very unique style and approach to the songs. Luckily, I listened to him when I was young, as he was one of my heroes. But it was hard, and we didn’t have a lot of time for me to sit there, and try to get the parts down exactly right for every song.“It was too much to ask when I had to learn like 15 songs in four days. And the first day of rehearsal was very short because they were so happy that they found a drummer, so everybody went to the pub to have some drinks!”He was left in the studio with keyboardist Geoff Nicholls to guide him, and eventually came up with the idea of mimicking Ward’s parts in the most recognisable sections of songs, while doing his own thing elsewhere.“I had cheat sheets too,” he added. “I wrote out these cheat sheets for each song and I had a book with them all in it, and I managed to pull it off.”Appice had to concentrate on supporting guitarist Tony Iommi’s performance. “With those Sabbath songs, a lot of them are slow – they’re right in the pocket, and then they slow down sometimes,” the drummer said.“I was aware of that, and I honed it by keeping my ears open. That’s one great piece of advice I can give: always keep your ears open. When you’re playing with a new band or a new musician, check out what they’re doing, check out how you can fit in.“So that’s what I did. And then we became a real band from being on the road together.”Appice can be found online on Tuesdays offering drum chat and lessons, then doing a similar show on Thursdays with brother Carmine.;2022-06-12;https://www.loudersound.com/news/black-sabbath-had-four-days-to-teach-vinny-appice-their-set-so-they-went-to-the-pub-instead;2022-06-13;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDBLACKSABBATHHADFOURDAYSTOTEACHVINNYAPPICETHEIRSET,SOTHEYWENTTOTHEPUBINSTEAD

This is my first auction and I’m excited to be here. Today would be Elvis’ 88th birthday"".Offering a suggestion on how the aircraft's current state of disrepair could be fixed for profitable use, a Mecum auctioneer informs attendees:  “This is an incredible restoration opportunity to create an Elvis exhibit for the world to enjoy"".The auctioneer's exhibit proposal is most likely connected to the fact that the Lockheed plane is unable to fly, following the removal of its four engines and most of its cockpit instrumentation in previous years.Following an uneventful bid, the aircraft sold for $260,000, or $286,000 if you include fees, which for the seller (businessman Jim Gagliardi, of Madera, California), works out as a loss of money, after having bought the vehicle at a 2017 auction for $430,000 ($498,000 including commission and fees).Since ownership, Gagliardi had never even visited the plane, although as the Roswell Daily Record newspaper reports, he did originally have some plans for it. “I was going to have it as kind of an advertisement, have people go in it and look at it"" he said to the publication. The plane was first purchased by Elvis Presley on December 22, 1976 for $840,000 and is one of several private jets owned by the late star, with two currently on display at his former home in Graceland.Although its sun-weathered outside appears worn, the insides still remain in good condition, featuring custom red velvet upholstery and gold-finish hardware, a microwave, a television, a cassette player, wood cabin panelling, cabin seating for up to nine occupants and six passenger seats.For images of the plane, visit the Mecum auction house website.";2023-01-10;https://www.loudersound.com/news/elvis-presleys-private-jet-has-been-sold-for-dollar260000-after-lying-abandoned-in-the-desert-for-40-years;2023-01-11;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDELVISPRESLEY'SPRIVATEJETHASBEENSOLDFOR$260,000AFTERLYINGABANDONEDINTHEDESERTFOR40YEARS

So I look at it always as a celebration and a tribute to him.""Discussing Mercury's impact on the music world, he continues: ""I think Freddie's many things. I think the voice alone, it does something to you when you listen to it. He had an incredible voice, and I think that, as his tool, connected him with so many people out there. ""And then his songwriting — he wrote beautiful, human, emotive music about the human experience, and I think that also connected him with people.

Both of them. Breaking news. We're thinking about doing both of those,"" declares Black, before Gass quips: ""it's a hybrid – a school of D.""Back in 2018, Tenacious D announced during a gig that a sequel to the film would be released in October of that year. Of course, that never happened, and five years later, we're still sat twiddling our thumbs. What did arrive in its place however was an animated series on their YouTube channel, Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto, which was released to coincide with their fourth studio album, Post-Apocalypto.While the duo have released a fair amount of new music in the years since the first movie's release back in 2012, there's been no concrete evidence that work on a new movie has commenced.In June of last year however, the pair revealed that they were working on something big. ""We're still touring and we got a very big project coming up that I can't really tell you anything about"" said Black, adding that they had ""a concept album coming down the pike.""Let's hope that we'll be getting a proper follow-up this time, and we'll all be singing along to potty-mouthed rock ditties about heavy metal and Satan soon.Pick Of Destiny grossed $8.2 million at the box office, and received mixed critical reviews. Nevertheless, the film has since become a classic in the pantheon of rock and metal films, with a soundtrack that's played at pretty much every alternative club night around.

Be it his angsty, ultra PDA relationship with actress Megan Fox or his reckless habit of pissing off the entire metal community, it's clear this is MGK's world, and we're all just living in it. So the latest news in the life and times of the headline-hogging Machine Gun Kelly is that despite getting the name of his forthcoming album Born With Horns tattooed on his arm, he's decided that actually, he wants to scrap that title and go for Mainstream Sellout. Not only is this a weird move based on the fact that he's already got the former moniker permanently inked up on his arm as mentioned, but he actually convinced his producer/Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker get the same tattoo done too.To break the news to Barker, Kellz filmed an awkwardly funny TikTok video, which sees him shyly asking the question ""We're friends no matter what, right?"" before announcing his secret. In response, Barker laughs in disbelief, but doesn't seem all that bothered. Which might possibly be because it’d take less time to read James Joyce’s Ulysses than all the drummer’s tattoos. Whether the pair will get the updated album title inked is anyone's guess...but may we suggest they both try out temporary tattoos first?Speaking of his upcoming album, the rapper-turned-punk rocker previously said that it would sound “more guitar-heavy” and feature ""deeper"" lyrics than his previous offerings. The record's first single, Papercuts, was released last August.Watch the TikTok below:

I can’t wait until we can do it again and get to play in many more places next time round.""""We spent a lot of time discussing which of the songs from the live show to include on this CD,"" adds Kotzen.

Previous issues include Dolly Parton, Kamala Harris, Tina Turner, Betty White, Michelle Obama, Barbra Streisand, Cher and Gloria Steinem.Female Force: Stevie Nicks was written by Michael Frizell and features artwork by Ramon Salas, and and takes a biographic look at the Fleetwood Mac singer's life and career.The 22 page comic is available both digitally and in print and can be found on multiple platforms. The book will also be available in hardback with cover by famed comic book artist Yonami, as well as a paperback cover version by Ramon Salas.Writer Michael Frizell says of the comic: ""There’s a popular meme that talks about how Taylor Swift writes sad songs about her exes, but Stevie Nicks makes her exes sing songs she wrote about them explaining how horrible they are, and every time I see it, I laugh. Stevie’s fearlessness makes her a rock legend and explains her staying power and popularity.”Earlier this week, Nicks announced the second leg of her US tour set to take place this autumn.The trek will kick off on September 13 in Clarkson, Michigan, and will see the Fleetwood Mac vocalist play in multiple cities across the US including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Nashville, Charlotte and Tampa, before signing off in West Palm Beach on October 28.Check out a preview of the comic book below:A post shared by TidalWave Productions (@tidalwaveprod) (opens in new tab)A photo posted by on Today's best Female Force: Stevie Nicks deals (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)No price information (opens in new tab)Check Thomann (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)No price information (opens in new tab)Check Amazon (opens in new tab)We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices";2022-07-28;https://www.loudersound.com/news/there-is-now-a-comic-book-you-can-buy-thats-all-about-stevie-nicks;2022-07-28;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDTHEREISNOWACOMICBOOKYOUCANBUYTHAT'SALLABOUTSTEVIENICKS

louder;Ghost's Tobias Forge would have loved to play guitar for The Rolling Stones;Ghost mastermind Tobias Forge tells Classic Rock magazine that, in a dream world, he'd have joined the Stones in 1969;"Given Ghost's thrilling ascendancy into metal's premier league one might imagine that all the rock n' roll dreams Tobias Forge nurtured growing up have now been fulfilled. But in a new interview in Classic Rock magazine, the Satanic Swedes' svengali reveals that there are certain dreams which are likely to remain cruelly out-of-reach, at least until some bright spark invents a time machine.Reflecting on the huge success his band have enjoyed in 2022, and the impact made by their fifth studio album Impera, a thankful Forge tells Classic Rock's Polly Glass, ""I feel like I managed to do a lot of things I set out to do"" and says that he and the Nameless Ghouls are ""recharging"" ahead of what is likely to be a busy 2023.In the course of the interview, referencing a previous statement from Forge where he admitted that he'd like to be able to play more guitar, Glass asks the 41-year old musician: 'If you could be the guitarist for a day in any band, which would it be?' His answer? The Rolling Stones in their prime.

""I would have loved to be what Mick Taylor was in 1969, coming into the Rolling Stones at their best era – but I would have stayed around!"" he replies. ""That would have been a great experience. Very fun music to play. Definitely within the limits of what I can play really well. I spent a lot of time as a kid learning how to play guitar.""

As a second pick - because it's always good to have a back-up - Forge says, ""Otherwise I would love to play in the Red Hot Chili Peppers"" adding ""I love what John Frusciante does.""You can read the full interview with Forge in the new issue of Classic Rock, which is on-sale now (opens in new tab).If Ghost's mainman picks up a copy for himself, he'll doubtless be delighted to see that CR staff and writers have voted Impera the second best album of 2022. In Metal Hammer, the album polled even higher, emerging as the magazine's Album Of 2022.(Image credit: Future)";2022-12-13;https://www.loudersound.com/news/ghosts-tobias-forge-would-have-loved-to-play-guitar-for-the-rolling-stones;2022-12-15;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDGHOST'STOBIASFORGEWOULDHAVELOVEDTOPLAYGUITARFORTHEROLLINGSTONES

RIP Wilko Johnson.(Image: Leif Laaksonen) pic.twitter.com/1cRqyi9b9XNovember 23, 2022See moreKnown for his percussive, 'fingerstyle' approach to guitar-playing, Wilko Johnson was one of rock’s most instantly identifiable guitarists. His choppy, simultaneous rhythm and lead style was inspired by Johnny Kidd & The Pirates guitarist Mick Green. Wilko  sharpened Green's template to a razor's edge, and in doing so paved the way for punk and rebuilt the blues for a new generation.A sharply intelligent and sensitive man, as part of British rockers Dr. Feelgood, Wilko was nevertheless a feral presence onstage. In the mid-70s, as rock music became more indulgent and pretentious, the Feelgoods stripped it right back to the bare essentials: no-nonsense rock'n'roll and cut-throat blues. The music press called it ""pub rock"", a term that didn;t sit well with Wilko.""I never really liked the term ‘pub rock’ because it was too vague"" he told Classic Rock. ""It doesn’t describe a type of music, it describes a type of venue. Pubs were where you could get gigs, but there were all sorts of bands on that scene: country, folk, soul, blues, it wasn’t as if we were all reading from the same book. I do think we shook people up a bit, though, because we were a lot more aggressive than the bands they were used to. We gave ’em a fright over their pints!""Wilko appeared on four of the band's influential albums between 1975-1977, and was their only songwriter. Their live album Stupidity went to no.1 (opens in new tab) in the UK in October 1976. The following year, in April 1977, Wilko left Dr. Feelgood under somewhat acrimonious circumstances. ""Let me put the record straight,"" he told Classic Rock. ""I didn’t leave, they threw me out after a big ruck, but the music press the following week had all these headlines saying ‘Wilko quits’. The relationship between myself and [vocalist] Lee Brilleaux had got very strained. He was a lovely guy, but there was some heavy tension between us, and a lot of that had to do with writing songs.""But his impact had been felt. A new generation of punk bands had been inspired by the Feelgoods' aggression and fat-free rock'n'roll. “Thousands of people play a Telecaster because of Joe Strummer,"" he told Guitarist magazine (opens in new tab). ""Well, Joe played a Telecaster because of me!” (Wilko, of course, played a Telecaster because of Mick Green.) The punks copied more than just Wilko's choice of guitar.Johnson would go on to form Solid Senders and The Wilko Johnson Band, before playing with the likes of Ian Dury And The Blockheads, Johnny Thunders and Roger Daltry in a career that spanned six decades.""Man Of The Year"": Wilko Johnson on the cover of Classic Rock magazine, December 2013 (Image credit: Future)In 2013, Wilko was diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer. He opted to not have treatment. Told that he had less than a year to live, he went on tour. At that year's Classic Rock Awards, Jimmy Page presented him with The Innovator award, presented to artists who pushed the envelope and broke new boundaries. ""I saw Dr Feelgood play live way back in the day,"" said Page, ""and the stage presence, the act, was phenomenal. I love Wilko’s style – I love everything about him! His playing is just amazing. He’s just got the Telecaster and an amp, and the amount of tone he gives out is incredible. Wilko’s got the whole package. And he’s more fun to watch than me.""Still under the impression that he had just months to live, he guested with The Urban Voodoo Machine on their ironic single Help Me Jesus (opens in new tab) and recorded the album Going Back Home with The Who's Roger Daltrey. It went to no.3 in the album charts in April 2014 and won Album Of The Year at the 2014 Classic Rock awards (opens in new tab).That same year, Wilko discovered that he'd been misdiagnosed. In fact, he had a more treatable form of pancreatic cancer than first feared. Following an 11 hour operation, he revealed himself to be cancer-free in October of that year.""This tumour weighed 3kg - that's the size of a baby,"" he told the BBC (opens in new tab). ""Anyway, they got it all. They cured me."" (Did he consider suing the medic who misdiagnosed him? ""No,"" he told Classic Rock's Dave Ling. ""Had he not done so then I wouldn’t have made the album with Roger Daltrey."")""That whole experience led to one of the greatest years of my life, in many ways,"" he said later. ""Facing death, sitting there at three o’clock in the morning thinking: 'Oh fuck, I’m going to die,' that’s something to experience. But it wasn’t always like that. Most of the time I was in a state of heightened consciousness. When you’re in that position you look around you and think: 'I’m alive and it’s so beautiful.' ""There were lots of funny kicks during that year, playing gigs – sometimes very big ones, like Fuji Rock festival – where you know that everybody knows you’re going to die. And you can’t go wrong, can you?"" he laughed.Johnson was playing live shows right up until the weeks before his death, having played sets in London, Poole Brighton and Birmingham in recent months. ""I’m a miserable so-and-so,"" he told Classic Rock in 2017. ""The only time I’m happy is when I’m playing, so that’s what I’m going to do. For as long as I’m still able to do so, playing music will fill my remaining allotted years.""No cause of death has been confirmed at this time.";2022-11-23;https://www.loudersound.com/news/wilko-johnson-dead-at-75;2022-11-23;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDWILKOJOHNSONHASDIED,AGED75

The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd;"Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason will share their memories of their late Pink Floyd bandmate Syd Barrett in a forthcoming documentary, Have You Got It Yet? The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd.Deadline reports that Mercury Studios has completed work on the documentary about the mercurial Cambridge-born musician, who attended high school with Roger Waters, co-founded Pink Floyd, and wrote the band's first two singles, Arnold Layne and See Emily Play, both of which were released in 1967. Barrett was eased out of the band the following year as his bandmates became increasingly alarmed by his erratic behaviour and mental stability, plus his psychedelic drugs use.

“Barrett dropped out of music, returning home to Cambridge for the last 30 years of his life and his first love of painting,” a release about the documentary notes. “Poignantly, some of Pink Floyd’s biggest worldwide hit records – Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Wall examine themes of madness and stardom including Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Wish You Were Here, written as tributes to Barrett.”

Have You Got It Yet? is directed by Rodney Bogawa and the late Storm Thorgerson, co-founder of Hipgnosis, who conceived the artwork for The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals, among others, in addition to covers of Barrett's solo albums The Madcap Laughs (1969) and Barrett (1970).In addition to Barrett's former bandmates, The Who’s Pete Townshend and Blur’s Graham Coxon are among those sharing their thoughts on the musician, who passed away on July 7, 2006. 

The film’s soundtrack is said to include over 50 Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett songs.As yet, no release date has been announced for the documentary.";2022-10-14;https://www.loudersound.com/news/roger-waters-david-gilmour-share-their-memories-of-late-pink-floyd-bandmate-syd-barrett-in-new-documentary;2022-10-15;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDROGERWATERS,DAVIDGILMOURSHARETHEIRMEMORIESOFLATEPINKFLOYDBANDMATESYDBARRETTINNEWDOCUMENTARY

He's now joined his fellow Skynyrd bandmates in rock and roll heaven, but we will all enjoy their music forever.""Following the rousing performance of Simple Man, the band played through a rendition of Skynyrd’s country rock anthem Sweet Home Alabama, with Slash firing out a typically bombastic guitar solo.Also playing within the rockstar supergroup was Chuck Leavell and Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers Band, with LeAnn Rimes and Wynonna Judd taking the role of the Honkettes, Lynyrd Skynyrd’s celebrated female backing vocalists.This summer, Lynyrd Skynyrd will head out on the road as special guests on ZZ Top’s Sharp Dressed Simple Man tour, which will kick off on July 21 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Watch the performance below:";2023-04-03;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-slash-and-zz-tops-billy-gibbons-play-sweet-home-alabama-at-star-studded-lynyrd-skynyrd-tribute;2023-04-05;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERWATCHSLASHANDZZTOP’SBILLYGIBBONSPLAYSWEETHOMEALABAMAATSTAR-STUDDEDLYNYRDSKYNYRDTRIBUTE

Inspired by vocalist Mikee Goodman's struggles with depression, the new video depicts a search for light through the darkness.Behind The Doors originally featured on the band's 2015 EP Opacities and will be played live for the first time during the band's reunion shows in November""Behind The Doors goes between a medically induced world into a world of darkness and depression, a feeling of hopelessness and longing,"" explains Goodman. ""I personally feel while we can we should always try to find the colour through the grey, the light through darkness, although, some days it can be easier said than done. We keep trying. Positive thinking is so important in our lives.""

""I am really happy with the video which Davie from 12 Inch Media created. I called him up and explained what the song was about, then a few days later I received this. Going between bright coloured psychedelic themes to the grey and mundane, on a journey through doors into different realms of the mind, it’s metaphorically somewhat of a visual portrayal of how powerful our minds are and how vicious the struggle between light and dark thoughts can be as they play out in our heads.""SikTh have reformed their original line-up and will perform two exclusive live shows in London and Manchester in November. The line-up features dual vocalists Goodman and Justin Hill, guitarists Dan Weller and Graham Pinney, bassist James Leach and drummer/percussionist Dan Foord reunited for new music in 2015, although Pinney and Hill left again soon after.Sikth will play Manchester's Academy 2 on November 25 and London's Electric Ballroom in Camden on November 26.";2022-06-01;https://www.loudersound.com/news/sikth-tackle-mental-health-issues-in-psychedelic-video-for-behind-the-doors;2022-06-02;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDSIKTHTACKLEMENTALHEALTHISSUESINPSYCHEDELICVIDEOFORBEHINDTHEDOORS

The songs Giddy Up, Somewhere Over The Rainbow Bar And Grill, Alligator Pants, Lo-Rez Sunset, and Manda Bala were co-written with John 5 several years ago at Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood.It is not known who has collaborated with the vocalist on this new song, but you can listen to below and hazard a guess, by all means:In a recent interview on Paltrocast With Darren Paltrowitz, John 5 revealed that he only learns of a song's release when everyone else does. ""I don't get a notice, which is funny,"" said the guitarist. ""There's a song that I just can't wait for Dave to release called Nothing Could Have Stopped Us and it's about Van Halen,"" he revealed. ""It's my favourite song that I've ever done with Dave, and it is beautiful. I don't know why he's not releasing that one yet. And I just can't wait for people to hear that one.

louder;If you’re looking for a Michael Jackson song played in the style of Slayer, stop scrolling now;This glorious mash-up will plug that Slayer-shaped hole in your blackened world;In a recent Metal Hammer interview with Slayer’s Kerry King, the guitarist reflected on life following the end of the band after almost a four-decade long tenure as one of thrash’s premier acts.“Every one of those shows was a bummer!” said King of their final tour. “We were going to all these places and all these cities where we have all this history. It’s a bummer to think, ‘I’m not gonna see my friends there again.’ You’d get to that country and know you were going to see these people, and you’d see them yearly. I haven’t seen them now in three years! That sucks! And the fans, too. Slayer means a lot to our fans, and they mean a lot to us.“I know I will see these people again, but no Slayer leaves a big hole for a lot of people.”Well, here’s something to temporarily plug that Slayer-shaped gap in everyone’s life.Michael Jackon’s Beat It, whose original recording features Toto’s Steve Lukather and a scorching solo by the late Eddie Van Halen, has been given the thrash treatment by Finnish YouTuber and multi-instrumentalist Otu Suurmunne.No stranger to these digital pages, Otu has gifted the rock world with outstandingly accurate takes on bands like Alice in Chains performing Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up and System Of A Down reconstructing Aqua’s Barbie Girl.This furious version of the King of Pop’s 1983 single does not disappoint.Like an aural alchemist, his guitar tone, production and delivery eerily echoes the fury of Slayer’s 1986 masterpiece Reign In Blood and cheekily reappropriates the ominous riff of the title track from their 1988 follow-up South of Heaven. Check it out in the video below.;2023-02-08;https://www.loudersound.com/news/if-youre-looking-for-a-michael-jackson-song-played-in-the-style-of-slayer-stop-scrolling-now;2023-02-08;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERIFYOU’RELOOKINGFORAMICHAELJACKSONSONGPLAYEDINTHESTYLEOFSLAYER,STOPSCROLLINGNOW

""It was supposed to be a depiction of the present world, but during these years a lot has changed. We talked about how we wanted to portray the polarity of our personal life, our surroundings and how the world seemed to fall apart around us.""There's a lot to disapprove and worry about, but we wanted to also address that there's also a lot to stand up for and rally behind as well. This is our way to empower the causes we support and denounce the injustices and movements we oppose. Conceptually, these ideas made it into the music through a more dynamic, fleet footed and dramatic sound than our previous releases.""Interestingly, 'Intill' is the Swedish word for “close,” and as such Apart represents the chasms that have emerged in the time since fans last heard from the band.Pre-order Apart.";2022-11-16;https://www.loudersound.com/news/feed-me-to-the-waves-stream-whole-of-brand-new-album-apart;2022-11-16;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDFEEDMETOTHEWAVESSTREAMWHOLEOFBRANDNEWALBUMAPART

The latter reaction was largely rooted in anger over the double standards held by society in regards to the exposure of male and female bodies; Lee’s nude photo remained on Instagram for several hours, while, previously, the posting of images which included bared female nipples have seen users’ accounts come under threat of deletion by the platform, which has strict guidelines on nudity. Other observers were outraged over the upload of the image itself, expressing concerns that the explicit content posted by the 59-year-old musician may have made its way onto the feeds of underage social media users. One social media user who appeared thrilled - albeit understandably somewhat shocked - by the unexpected post was Tommy Lee’s 35-year-old wife Brittany Furlan, who has since posted reaction videos, depicting the moment she first saw her husband’s NSFW upload, on her TikTok account.In one video, the comedian/actor - who married Lee in February 2019 - reenacts opening her phone after receiving a notification that her husband had made a new post, before exclaiming “What the fuck!”

In the next clip, she lip-syncs to a quote from Family Guy, where the character Lois Griffin says “Peter, the horse is here”, a cheeky reference to the size of her husband’s ‘junk’.Check out the videos below:

The Zazulas had met the young Californian thrash metal band towards the end of 1981 and took on managerial duties for the group, an arrangement which remained in place up until after the release of 1984's Ride The Lightning, when Metallica signed with Elektra Records and switched management. Megaforce played a key role in the development of both heavy metal, punk and rock throughout the 1980s and beyond, working with everyone from Overkill and Testament to Mushroomhead, Fozzy and even a reunited Bad Brains, the Zazulas becoming beloved fixtures in the heavy music community. Marsha Zazula passed away in January 2021 after a battle with cancer. At the time of her passing, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich posted a tribute to her in which he thanked her for ""making it happen.""In the post, he went on to thank Marsha for ""supporting us, for encouraging us, for advising us, for sheltering us, for feeding us, and most importantly for cheering us on and along with your husband Jonny, believing in the possibilities of how a gang of misfits and outsiders like ourselves could connect with a larger and likeminded audience…

A beat passed, breathing subsided to a point where Jonny could speak and he excitedly raved at me, “I’m bringing them to NY, we’re going to make an album, and if nobody will put it out I’ll start my own label and I will put it out, and you guys will be next. And he did all of that. And he changed all of our worlds.""Vocalist Joey Belladonna responded to the news on Facebook, thanking Zazula ""for being a great man, a great manager, and for believing in me.""Bassist Frank Bello wrote a similar message in his book Fathers, Brothers, and Sons: Surviving Anguish, Abandonment, and Anthrax, which was released in late 2021. In it, he explains that “I’ve always been close with [Jon] and to his late wife Marsha, who passed away when I was writing this book. They were very nurturing and helpful, especially in those early days. They always looked after me and gave me confidence, and I love them for that. They thought I was good for Anthrax, and I thank them for it.”A post shared by Anthrax (@anthrax)A photo posted by on A post shared by Scott Ian (@scottianthrax)A photo posted by on ""They took us in and made us feel like family"" - TestamentTestament guitarist Alex Skolnick also shared his memories of Jonny and Marsha, and the vital role they played in helping thrash metal develop. ""Whether as a label head or manager, he guided careers and had a massive impact on the music biz. Without him many of our lives - listeners and artist’s alike - might look very different. He and his beloved partner Marsha Z made us feel valued at a crucial point in our young lives (keep in mind, we were a bunch of scraggly misfits often on the outs with our own families who couldn’t understand our long hair, ripped jeans, leather jackets and this horrible racket we called “music” ). From Megaforce HQ in Old Bridge, New Jersey and their home nearby, they took us in and made us feel like family.Make no mistake, Jonny could be tough - You might overhear him tearing apart some manager or attorney limb from limb during a phone negotiation, call the guy some unprintable insult and smash down the receiver. Yet in a blink of an eye, he’d say “sorry” and get right back to being our warm uncle from Jersey. Truth be told, there were some eventual fallings out with some of the artists he loved and who had loved him. But in the end, hard feelings were cast aside, relationships were repaired and those business disagreements became water under the (old) bridge.

His record store in Jersey was called Rock N Roll Heaven. Now he joins Marsha in the real Rock N Roll Heaven, the one upstairs.""A post shared by Alex Skolnick (@alexskolnick)A photo posted by on ""A true giant of metal"" - RavenExodus described Zazula's death as ""a giant loss to the metal community,"" while also stating that ""a true legend is gone way too soon"" in a post on Instagram. Megadeth (and former Soilwork) drummer Dirk Verbeuren remembered him as ""a kind-hearted man who cared deeply about his artists, friends, family and pets.""British heavy metal group Raven, who were also signed to Megaforce and later took Metallica out as support on their first national tour, called Zazula ""a true giant of metal.... and a man that changed our lives.""American radio host and author Eddie Trunk, who joined Megaforce in 1986 and eventually became the label's vice president, said ""I have a ton of memories and gratitude for a guy who took a 22 year old kid and made him VP of Megaforce Records and let him sign one of his heroes, Ace Frehley"".Fozzy vocalist Chris Jericho shared his own feelings about being ""the last band Megaforce ever signed."" Going on to say ""It’s a great honor to know we were a small part of the massive legacy he and Marsha created"".Tributes were also paid by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, Anvil, CKY, Venom Inc., Metal Blade founder Brian Slagel, Ministry/Madonna guitarist Monte Pittman, Cro-Mags and A&R legend Monte Conner, as well as countless metal fans who had become aware of Zazula's contributions to the rise of thrash and the wider world of music.A post shared by Dirk Verbeuren (@dirkverbeuren)A photo posted by on RIP a true giant of metal.... and a man that changed our lives... rest easy Mr.Z...... pic.twitter.com/kSyf9HyvufFebruary 1, 2022See moreThese two photos are over 30 years apart.

We sent John cassettes of newly released music, of demos, of just finished mixes, and in return he would send VHS videos of the scenes that needed music.""Tracks include Eighties by Killing Joke, Don't You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds, Pretty In Pink by The Psychedelic Furs, Love Missile F1-11 (Ultraviolence Mix) by Sigue Sigue Sputnik and This Woman's Work by Kate Bush.Hughes' son James Hughes says: “It serves as a reminder not just to the musicians he championed in the 1980s, but to how intensely his search for music expanded beyond this era. ""Until his final days, he was still collecting outrageous amounts of music from around the world, galaxies removed from the New Romantic and new wave sounds that, to many, still define him.”Gotch adds: “John said he only made movies so he could choose what music to put in them, so as his success at the box office grew, and thus his power with the studios, the number of tracks in his films, by up and coming UK bands, steadily grew.” The box set will include a booklet which will feature memories from James Hughes, Gotch, Matthew Broderick and Ron Payne, and also have track-by-track notes.John Hughes died in 2009 at the age of 59.(Image credit: Demon Music Group)(Image credit: Demon Music Group)Today's best Life Moves Pretty Fast: The John Hughes Mixtapes deals (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)£34.99 (opens in new tab)View (opens in new tab)Life Moves Pretty Fast: The John Hughes...Life Moves Pretty Fast: The John Hughes Mixtapes (opens in new tab)We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices";2022-08-08;https://www.loudersound.com/news/box-set-of-music-from-the-films-of-john-hughes-will-take-us-right-back-to-the-80s;2022-08-10;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDBOXSETOFMUSICFROMTHEFILMSOFJOHNHUGHESWILLTAKEUSRIGHTBACKTOTHE80S

Having said that, I do something at a level that he doesn't do...""";"Dee Snider has once again come forward to re-clarify his comments made last month about Robert Plant and Ronnie James Dio.During a divisive discussion with fans on Twitter, the Twisted Sister leader stated that he thought the aforementioned vocalists lacked stage presence, and that he didn't regard them as real ""performers"", unlike Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger. Since making his controversial declarations, Snider has been asked to reiterate his view in multiple interviews, previously offering: ""You can't put me and Robert Plant in the same category"".Now in a new interview with Ultimate Guitar, the singer shares further perspective on his argument, explaining: ""When I said they weren't great frontmen, everybody said, 'Here's Dee shooting his mouth off again.'""But I'm not just shooting my mouth off; I've actually taken a lot of time to think about and consider it. I didn't just make an arbitrary statement. I've thought about it. I got on my computer, and I studied and researched it.""He continues, ""But anyway, I said this, and then, on social media, someone said, 'Okay, so what's the difference between you and them?' So, I'll tell you the difference now: Ronnie James Dio, for example, was a great singer, but he was not a performer, at least, not in the sense of not a frontman.""But me? I'm a frontman who is almost like a vaudeville performer. Now, a frontman doesn't have to sing well but needs to be a guy who can engage the audience and entertain the people who stand there. A frontman that can wow the crowd with their incredible voice, yeah, that's entertaining on a different level, but it's not the same as a full-scale performance.""Snider then goes on to compare himself to Robert Plant after being asked if he believes his original comments were misunderstood. He says: ""Absolutely. I am not saying I'm Robert Plant, nor am I saying I'm even in his league. Having said that, I do something at a level that he doesn't do, and that is I engage the crowd. ""I am able to establish a level of audience participation that makes the entire arena feel like they are in the front row. Robert Plant doesn't do that, but I do. He's an incredible singer, but showmanship, that's what I do well. But I said this, and people were like, 'How dare you?' Well, guess what? I fucking dare.""Twisted Sister reformed for a one-off performance last month at the sixth annual Metal Hall of Fame ceremony in Agoura Hills, California.Asked if fans could expect to see more of Twisted Sister on stage, Snider told Eon Music: ""A hard ‘no' plans. No plans at all to do that .""You know, I've said when people retire they should leave the stage, and all those bands, I’m tired of buying ‘No More Tours’ shirts and seeing people signing contracts in blood and then they show up three years later.

Since the app has increased in popularity, big name bands such as Metallica, Ghost, Bring Me The Horizon and more have become an active part of the platform's community.“I won’t be relevant with the Tik-Tokers of the world because it’s just not on their radar"" Keenan explains. ""The things they respond to now…I’m not necessarily relevant. But there’s an entire generation of people that’s not my generation. They’ve grown with this thing, so as they’re aging, they’re going to be discovering it.”When questioned by host Rogan whether relevancy matters to him as an artist, the singer replies: “You can’t [think about that], because then you’ll be desperate and get plastic surgery and look an alien trying to insert yourself into some stupid fucking thing. It turns to desperation really quickly, so just maintain your art.”As Rogan makes a negative remark about bands' ""quest for relevancy"" in trying to keep up with what's popular, Keenan responds: ""It turns to desperation very quickly. It reeks. So just maintain your art, dude.""Watch the interview below:Earlier this year, Keenan admitted to stealing song ideas from Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor.

Its doors will officially open from 2025 thanks to a £10million donation from the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.The David Bowie Is...collection first opened as a touring museum in March 2013 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 2016, a documentary exploring the collection was released, which captured the exhibit's closing night when housed at the V&A. In July 2018, David Bowie Is...came to an end at the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. That same year, it became available to view via augmented reality with a voiceover by actor Gary Oldman, a long-time friend of the singer.Each archive stored over 500 items of memorabilia from numerous moments in David Bowie's extensive career, including handwritten lyrics, original costumes, fashion, photography, film, music videos, set designs, Bowie’s own instruments and album artwork.V&A Director Dr Tristram Hunt says of the new opening: “David Bowie was one of the greatest musicians and performers of all time. The V&A is thrilled to become custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public. Bowie’s radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style – from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monáe to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons.“Our new collections centre, V&A East Storehouse, is the ideal place to put Bowie’s work in dialogue with the V&A’s collection spanning 5,000 years of art, design, and performance. My deepest thanks go to the David Bowie Estate, Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group for helping make this a reality and for providing a new sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow.”While a spokesperson from David Bowie's estate adds: ""With David’s life’s work becoming part of the UK’s national collections, he takes his rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses. The David Bowie Centre for the Study of Performance- and the behind the scenes access that V&A East Storehouse offers– will mean David’s work can be shared with the public in ways that haven’t been possible before, and we’re so pleased to be working closely with the V&A to continue to commemorate David’s enduring cultural influence.”Actress Tilda Swinton, the star's collaborator and friend offers: “In 2013, the V&A’s David Bowie Is… exhibition gave us unquestionable evidence that Bowie is a spectacular example of an artist, who not only made unique and phenomenal work, but who has an influence and inspiration far beyond that work itself. Ten years later, the continuing regenerative nature of his spirit grows ever further in popular resonance and cultural reach down through younger generations.“In acquiring his archive for posterity, the V&A will now be able to offer access to David Bowie’s history – and the portal it represents – not only to practicing artists from all fields, but to every last one of us, and for the foreseeable future. This is a truly great piece of news, which deserves the sincerest gratitude and congratulations to all those involved who have made it possible.”";2023-02-23;https://www.loudersound.com/news/david-bowie-is-vanda-exhibit-to-become-a-permanent-fixture-in-london;2023-02-26;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERDAVIDBOWIEISV&AEXHIBITTOBECOMEAPERMANENTFIXTUREINLONDON
louder;Alex Henry Foster premieres video for Lou Reed's The Power Of The Heart;Catch a special live performance of The Power Of The Heart via Prog's Facebook page on Sunday at 7pm;"Canadian post-rocker Alex Henry Foster and his band The Long Shadows have released a new video for their eight-minute plus cover of Lou Reed's The Power Of The Heart which you can watch below.The band will also be hosting a special live performance of the song which you can watch on the Prog Magazine Facebook page this Sunday at 7pm GMT.""It took me years, streaming into the bleakest turbulences of my own inner voyage, to envision the prospect of making a monument of sincerity such as The Power Of The Heart mine. Self-acceptance in an age of make-believes is what allows someone to find themselves, and it’s once emancipated from the self-preservative escapism that one can navigate amongst the vestiges of their existence, which in turn leads one to simply be, as an individual and originator.""Being liberated from the anguish to be seen for who I am is the reason why I didn’t feel the pressure to mimic Reed’s incarnation of the song, nor was I constrained by the burden of having to emulate his intimate intent. If my initial appropriation of the song stood as a homage to Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson’s love and respective creative expression, it would grow beyond its conceptualised embodiment as I began to enfranchise myself through it. It is in that moment that it wasn’t a revision process anymore, but the result of a total abandonment designed by my own instinctive drift and surrendering.""Noises became sounds, and musical arrangements evolved into some sort of spiritual uplift for me, turning it all into a celebration of what can’t be owned, measured, or defined, a boundless and infinite transformative ascension that can only be experienced once shared and given away. That is for me the true everlasting nature that is the power of the heart.""Alex Henry Foster will also bring his Not All Wonders Have Been Lost tour to venues across the UK this June. They will play:

We’ve also taken deep dive on some cover versions that have become bona fide rock classics. That’s not all, though. We also bid a fond farewell to Budgie’s Burke Shelley, a man who was no stranger to what a cover version by a high-profile band could do for you; chat to Beth Hart – including about her album of Led Zeppelin covers!; hang out with blues maestro Eric Gales; take a trip back in time to David Bowie’s 50th-birthday bash at Madison Square Garden in 1997; and much more.The new issue of Classic Rock is on sale now.FeaturesCover Versions
Whether it’s because they like a song and think they can do a good version of it themselves, or because they can’t come up with a song of their own, many artists have found success from covering someone else’s – on occasions with an even better version than the original. We talk to many coverers and coverees, and take a look at some of the best or most memorable cover versions, including Thin Lizzy, Joan Jett, The Clash, Led Zeppelin, Johnny Cash and many, many more.Beth Hart

Eddie Van Halen died in 2020 after a long battle with cancer.The show, which is presented by Dr. Michael Hunter, Chief Medical Examiner in San Joaquin County, California, has previously broadcast shows about the deaths of a number of musicians including Tom Petty, David Bowie, Lou Reed, Chris Cornell, Gregg Allman, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Prince, Kurt Cobain, Dennis Wilson, George Harrison, and Scott Weiland.  Reelz' description of the show (opens in new tab), which remarks that Van Halen was ""surprisingly an immigrant"", goes on to outline his career before referring to the late guitarist's health battles.""Often relying on alcohol and other substances to maintain his creativity, Eddie would spend many years in and out of rehab,"" they say. ""He was a workaholic, often pushing his body to the limits in order to perform while secretly battling illness. Eddie died at the age of 65 from cancer. But if caught early, Eddie’s disease had reasonable survival rates. ""So what happened? World renowned forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Hunter needs to analyse every detail of Eddie Van Halen’s life in order to piece together what else may have been going on in his body, ultimately leading to his untimely death.""Wolfgang Van Halen has slammed the show, taking to twitter to react to Blabbermouth's reporting of the story (opens in new tab). ""Fuck Reelz,"" he wrote. ""Fuck everyone that works on this show, and fuck you if you watch it. Fucking disgusting trying to glamourise someone’s death from cancer. Pathetic and heartless.""The cause of Eddie Van Halen's death was confirmed by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health in December 2020. The death certificate cited the immediate cause as a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke. He also had several underlying causes, including pneumonia, the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, lung cancer and skin cancer.Reelz have launched a teaser video for the episode, which you can watch below (available to US-based viewers only). The show is broadcast on Reelz at 5pm Eastern on June 5, and repeated at 10pm. Fuck @ReelzChannel, fuck everyone that works on this show, and fuck you if you watch it.

They also played 2000’s Blood Brothers for the first time in five years.Appearing on Chris Jericho’s Talk Is Jericho podcast recently, Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson said the band had talked about playing Senjutsu from start to finish at some point in the future.“We've talked about doing the entire album start to finish, but not this time around,"" said Bruce. ""And we all appreciate that that is something that really diehard fans will probably love, [while] other people will go, 'I'm not gonna go see that.'

Open Arms. Who's Cryin' Now. Don't Stop Believin'. All of that. But there's always been the other Journey. The band Before Perry. The Journey of the first three albums, the one with all those jazzy, progressive rock sounds. The one that favoured lengthy instrumental workouts over three-and-a-half minutes singles. And it's that Journey who are the subject of the latest video to be uploaded to The Midnight Special's increasingly unmissable YouTube archive.The broadcast actually comes from May 1979, two years after Perry had joined the band, and two months after their release of fifth alum Evolution. Hosting the show, Journey were able to open up the broadcast with five songs from the new album – Loving You Is Easy, Just the Same Way, Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin, City of the Angels and Too Late – before taking it old-school for the show's closer. The action kicks off with a huge-haired Neal Schon introducing a ""jam"" for the audience. He welcomes jazz fusion pioneer Herbie Hancock to the stage, and the band play a tight-but-loose version of (I'm a) Road Runner, the Holland-Dozier-Holland song that was a hit for Junior Walker and the Allstars in 1966. The two musicians – who had both appeared on the self-titled debut album by all-star Latin fusion outfit Giants the previous year – trade licks (as they used to say) as the jam evolves, Perry shows he can ""do"" funk as well as the next man, and there's both choreographed and unchoreographed dancing. It's extremely fluid, and, quite frankly, way more fun than it ought to be. Quite how the rest of the show panned out is unclear. Hancock followed Journey's first set, with further dance-friendly material from The Jacksons and Anita Ward, plus an unlikely showing from barely-remembered UK rockabilly crew Levi and the Rockats.

One such writer was Brian Lilley, political columnist for the Toronto Sun, who filmed Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau singing Queen's classic Bohemian Rhapsody at the Corinthia hotel on Whitehall, where the Canadian delegation was staying. Lilley uploaded the 14-second clip Twitter, where it was greeted with the kind of rabid division that's currently de rigueur when political figures do anything out of the ordinary. And by that we mean the ordinary things that normal people do. Lilley himself was quick to downplay the incident, tweeting (opens in new tab), ""I don’t understand the outrage over Trudeau singing at the hotel bar or the people furious at the photos showing all the former PMs smiling. Are they all supposed to sit with sullen faces in sackcloth and ashes?"" He later added (opens in new tab), ""One of the reasons I’m not outraged at Trudeau singing is there are other, bigger issues to be furious with him over.""Meanwhile, his Toronto Sun colleague Lorrie Goldstein rounded up the adverse reaction in a piece headlined ""PM slammed for ‘tone deaf’ musical performance (opens in new tab)"", which included details of the kind of partisan backlash only social media can generate. It all got so noisy that a spokesman for the Prime Minister's office was obliged to issue a statement. ""After dinner on Saturday, Prime Minister joined a small gathering with members of the Canadian delegation, who have come together to pay tribute to the life and service of Her Majesty,"" it read. ""Gregory Charles, a renowned musician from Quebec and Order of Canada recipient, played piano in the hotel lobby which resulted in some members of the delegation including the prime minister joining.""In a separate statement, Charles told The Toronto Star (opens in new tab), ""Have not seen a video but I did, with a small group of Canadians, get to spend a few splendid minutes with the PM late on Saturday.

The single will be available on July 15, excluding Japan where it will be released on August 3 and USA, Canada, Australia and Mexico where it's October 21.Hey Hey Rise Up was the band's first new original music they've recorded together as a band since 1994’s The Division Bell and alongside David Gilmour and Nick Mason featured long-time Floyd bassist Guy Pratt and keyboard player Sawhney on keyboards, plus vocals from Andriy Khlyvnyuk of Ukrainian band Boombox.. The single, which was initially released digitally in April and was #1 in 27 countries, will be available on 7” and CD single.“Any war, but particularly a war that is started by a world superpower against an independent democratic nation, has got to raise enormous anger and frustration in one,"" says David Gilmour. ""As I said before, I have a small connection there; my daughter-in-law is from Ukraine. And the band Boombox are Ukrainian people that I already knew, not well, but from some time ago. It’s an enormously difficult, frustrating, and anger-making thing that one human being could have the power to go into another independent democratic nation and set about killing the population. It’s just obscene to an extent that is just beyond my belief.”Both formats will also feature a newly reworked version of A Great Day For Freedom taken from The Division Bell. David Gilmour has reworked the song using the original tapes which feature Nick Mason on drums and Richard Wright on keyboards, along with backing vocals from Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine and Durga McBroom.You can watch the video for Hey Hey Rise Up below.Pre-order Hey Hey Rise Up.The new issue of Classic Rock magazine tells the story of the the tour that road-tested Pink Floyd's The Dark Side Of The Moon.

louder;Ghost's Impera is Metal Hammer's album of the year;Ghost's Impera takes top place on the Metal Hammer critics' poll for 2022, but there are plenty of surprises in the Top 50;"Lockdown might be over, but the ceaseless tide of albums and new recording projects it has given us has meant the past 12 months have been anything but quiet. From Rammstein's emotive Zeit to Slipknot's experimental (and somewhat divisive) The End, So Far, 2022 has offered up a veritable banquet of new metal records for us to sink our teeth into. But while newcomers Heriot stormed the gates with Profound Morality and Dave Grohl dabbled in extremity with Dream Widow, only one band could take the crown position of Album Of The Year: take a bow, Sweden's satanic sensations, Ghost. In a poll of the great and good who bring you new issues of Metal Hammer each month, Ghost's fifth studio album Impera stood head-and-shoulders above the rest, its insidious anthems and oh-so-memorable choruses ensuring few of us have managed to escape its grasp since the album's March 11 release.A chart-topping success in the band's native Sweden (as well as Austria, Germany and Spain), Impera also reached number 2 in both the UK and US, held off top in the UK by singer-songwriter Rex Orange County and in the US by rapper Lil Durk. Ghost did nab the no. 1 spot for albums sold in the US however, selling over 37,000 copies in its first week to beat The Weeknd. What's more, Impera had the highest sales week for a rock record since Foo Fighters' 2021 release Medicine At Midnight.  The Metal Hammer review of Impera was equally as effusive, stating ""Impera wins on bolshiness, bravado and skyscraping songs alone. Ghost have turned in a modern metal classic with an arena rock heart. It turns out the devil doesn’t have all the best tunes. Tobias Forge does.""But while Ghost have taken top spot, what of the rest of the list? In another insanely stacked year of brilliant new releases, it's no surprise that the Metal Hammer critics' poll has its fair share of curve-balls. Zeal & Ardor's self-titled took a very admirable second place, while metallic hardcore upstarts Ithaca came in third with They Fear Us. Rammstein, Venom Prison, Clutch and Soul Glo all also make their appearances in the top 10, while some of the year's biggest bands pop up further down the list. Of course, if you want to see the whole thing, you'll need to pick up the latest issue of Metal Hammer, on-sale now.

I can practice all I want and stay as faithful as I want, but I am never going to escape that. “It's like if Randy Rhoads were to play Eddie Van Halen's Eruption. No matter what he did, it would sound like Randy playing, not Eddie. You're never going to mistake Randy for Eddie or Eddie for Randy, and it's the same thing here with me playing Dime's stuff.”Wylde will have help in replicating some of Dimebag's innovative sound, in the form of the Pantera icon's equipment and his guitar tech.Wydle adds: ""I'll be using my guitars, effects, and pedals, a lot of the pedals that Dime actually gave me, and yeah, I'll definitely be using some of Dime's pedals and stuff, too.“I'm still working out how it'll all come together, but I am looking forward to seeing how it all flows once I do.

Here's what you get when you empty your bank account for an 'Enhanced Experience' on Metallica's 2023 world tour;Metallica are offering a selection of ticket packages for their upcoming 2023 world tour, ranging from $414 to $7,272;"Earlier this week, Metallica announced that not only would they be releasing a brand new album (72 Seasons), but that they'd be embarking on huge world tour in 2023. They also shared banging surprise single Lux Æterna.The M72 world tour will kick off on April 27, with the San Francisco metallers set to play two nights in every city they visit. Support acts at various shows on the tour include Pantera, Greta Van Fleet, Mammoth WVH, Ice Nine Kills, Architects, and Five Finger Death Punch. For the trek, Metallica are offering an 'Enhanced Experience', which offers fans various 'privileges' depending on how much money they pay, with tickets ranging from $414 to $7,272. While each level of 'enhancement' grants fans entry into both concerts plus priority check-in at their chosen city, they all come with a varying degree of perks.The first level, aka the Frantic Early-Entry GA Package, costs just over $400 and permits early access to the General Admission section of the venue, along with a limited-edition piece of merchandise and a drink.For $518, fans can get the Seek & Destroy Reserved Package, which comes with a reserved seat in the lower bowl section of the venue for both nights and a piece of merchandise. What, no drink? Stingy!The One Enhanced Experience is available at a minimum of $830, and gets you a premium reserved seat, access to the pre-show party in the Black Box lounge to hang out with other Metallica fans, and an MP3 download of both concerts.Metallica's M72 tour is set to feature a new in-the-round stage design that relocates the famed Metallica Snake Pit to centre stage. To watch the show from this area, fans can do so with the Moth Into Flame Snake Pit Experience for a base price of $1,038. Like the previous packages, they'll also be able to attend the pre-show party and receive limited-edition merchandise and a beverage. The penultimate deal, the Nothing Else Matters Snake Pit Experience, starts at a price of $3,222, and not only gets you into the Snake Pit, but also offers a meet and greet opportunity with two members of Metallica, and an escorted production tour by the band's crew. These lucky fans will also be given collectibles including a setlist autographed by the band, show posters and commemorative tickets.The final bank-busting package, the Lux Aeterna Private Platform Experience, costs a total of $7,272, and offers you pretty much rockstar treatment.

At this price, fans can watch the concerts at a private viewing platform with up to eight people, and have access to cooler full of soft drinks and beer. They'll also get into the pre-show party, receive a merch item for everyone in their group and a fast-delivery service that will send their merch orders straight to their area.For the super-hardcore Metallica loyalists, the band are additionally offering an I Disappear ticket, which grants General Admission ticket to as many shows as their ticket allows. Again, this option comes with varying degrees of opportunities depending on price. For example, the top option for this ticket, priced at $3498, allows punters to attend as many shows as they please on two continents for two years. That's alot of Metallica.General two-day tickets will be on sale on tomorrow, December 2, via Ticketmaster.

Since winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021, the Italian four-piece have become one of the world's most recognisable bands, but the quartet haven't always been the strutting glam-rock dandies we know and love today.Rewind five years to when Damiano David, Thomas Raggi, Victoria De Angelis and Ethan Torchio were just four 16-17 year old music-obsessed high school kids, and they looked and sounded markedly different. But the group's talent was evident even at this nascent stage.For proof, check out the fresh-faced teenagers performing an acoustic cover of Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, the title track of the London-born singer/songwriter's second album, the UK second-best selling album of the 21st century.Aside from how adorable the four-piece look, the most striking element of the group's Rooftop Sessions performance is David's fabulous vocal performance, the singer doing a wonderful job of recreating Winehouse's gritty, bluesy singing style, and nodding to the late singer's laidback performing style by casually dragging on a cigarette between lines.Watch the performance below:On this day 15 years ago Winehouse won five Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album, for Back to Black, and Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Performance, all for the album's first single Rehab.;2023-02-10;https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-a-fresh-faced-pre-fame-maneskin-cover-amy-winehouse-classic-back-to-black-as-teenagers;2023-02-12;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERWATCHAFRESH-FACED,PRE-FAMEMÅNESKINCOVERAMYWINEHOUSECLASSICBACKTOBLACKASTEENAGERS

Omens is a reaction to the state of the world,” vocalist Randy Blythe said of the new material. ""It’s a very pissed-off record. It is extremely pissed-off.”The band recently confirmed a North American tour from September 9 to October 20 in support of the release. They’ll be accompanied by Killswitch Engage, Baroness and Suicide Silence across select dates. “Two decades ago, Lamb of God, along with Killswitch Engage, were a part of a new wave of American heavy metal music,” guitarist Mark Morton said of the road trip.“Our scene grew from a small, loosely connected network of underground shows in basements and warehouses, into a global phenomenon that helped define an entire generation of modern heavy metal.""We are thrilled to announce The Omens Tour, which celebrates not only the perseverance and impact of that original movement, but also the creativity and originality of the bands that it influenced. Heavy metal is alive and well. The Omens Tour proudly showcases the depth and diversity of our scene. This is not a tour to miss.”";2022-06-10;https://www.loudersound.com/news/lamb-of-god-unveil-new-single-nevermore;2022-06-16;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERSOUNDLAMBOFGODUNVEILNEWSINGLENEVERMORE
louder;Metallica weren't allowed to make eye contact with Mick Jagger when they supported the Rolling Stones;Lars Ulrich's dreams of partying 'til dawn with Keith Richards when Metallica played with the Rolling Stones were somewhat wide of the mark;"Lars Ulrich has revealed that Metallica were told not to make eye contact with Mick Jagger when they supported The Rolling Stones.Metallica played two shows with the Stones at SBC Park (now Oracle Park) in their San Francisco hometown on November 13 and 15, 2005, the first time they had performed as special guests to anyone since 1992, and at the time, Ulrich described the opportunity as ""an honour and a privilege.""But in new interview with Bill Maher on his Club Random with Bill Maher podcast, the Danish drummer reveals that he and his bandmates were instructed not to look vocalist Mick Jagger in the eye when he walked through the stadium's backstage area.

""At that time we had played shows over our career with Deep Purple, with AC/DC,  with a few other bands, all the bands that I had posters on on my wall when I was a kid, and so the last one of those boxes to check was the Stones,"" Ulrich tells Maher.

""So we're sitting backstage, and - and this is in no way a judgment on the Stones, this is really more about us - at one point a a personal assistant or whatever comes and says, 'Mick Jagger's gonna walk through here in a couple minutes, he's going over to his private gym in his truck, and he's going to warm up before the show. When he walks through here, please don't make eye contact with him or talk to him'.""So we're sitting there going, What? He has a truck with a portable gym in it? He goes and warms up for 30-45 minutes before he goes on stage? Cue Hahaha, Oh my God! Now guess who's got a truck with a gym in it? Guess who's got a Peloton bike on the road with us? Guess who's got a chef who walks around and makes us protein drinks and all kinds of other nasty stuff?""At this point Maher interrupts and suggests that the more significant point here is not that Jagger warms up before gigs, but that others are instructed not to look him in the eye. Ulrich then says that the only contact that the band were permitted to have with the Stones, was having a photo taken with the band as they walked to the stage.He adds: ""I had dreams, like, I thought, we're gonna play with the Rolling Stones and you know where I'm gonna spend my whole time, is in Keith Richards hotel room, sitting at one of those legendary parties 'til nine o'clock in the morning: I'll be the last one to leave! It wasn't exactly like that.""""I always go and say hello to our support act: I look them in the eye, I ask them if there's anything they need. It's a human thing; if somebody comes out and plays on a Metallica stage I want them to feel at home.""Watch the full interview with Lars Ulrich below:Metallica have also released an official video for another track from their new album 72 Seasons, Too Far Gone, which is below.Metallica are on the covers of the latest issues of Metal Hammer (opens in new tab) and Classic Rock magazine (opens in new tab).Metallica are on the cover of the current issue of Metal Hammer, and also on the latest cover of Classic Rock magazine.Today's best Metallica: 72 Seasons deals (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)£12.83 (opens in new tab)View (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)£52.22 (opens in new tab)£38.66 (opens in new tab)View (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab)No price information (opens in new tab)Check Thomann (opens in new tab)We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices";2023-04-17;https://www.loudersound.com/news/metallica-eye-contact-mick-jagger-rolling-stones;2023-04-18;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERMETALLICAWEREN'TALLOWEDTOMAKEEYECONTACTWITHMICKJAGGERWHENTHEYSUPPORTEDTHEROLLINGSTONES

louder;Lars Ulrich thinks Metallica have about ten years left as a touring band;"Lars Ulrich: ""I know there's some people in the comments section that think that point has already come [where Metallica should stop] — and I appreciate that""";"Lars Ulrich has opened up about Metallica's future as a touring band, sharing his thoughts on how long the Californian metal kings can continue before the march of time prevents them from being able to perform to the high standards they've set across the past four decades. When Metallica reach this point, the drummer states that they'll most likely throw in the towel, but he's confident that that day remains a long way off. When questioned about what's on the horizon for the San Francisco metal heavyweights, in terms of how their age might affect their touring plans (all members of the band currently range from 58-60 years-old), Ulrich tells Revolver, ""It's not something we've talked a lot about, no. I think most of the energy and the resources go into trying to stay healthy, stay cohesive, stay functioning.""As I get older, I spend more and more of my time on my daily workouts, on my cardio, on my strength training. I'm chained to my Peloton hours a day. It's all about trying to stay healthy: eating healthy, living healthy, whatever it is each of us need to bring to the table.""He continues, ""Obviously, there is a point where it's maybe not going to function anymore at some level, where we can't play Battery or Master of Puppets or songs like that.""I know there's some people in the comments section that think that point has already come — and I appreciate that. [Laughs] But the only thing I can say is that it hasn't happened yet, knock on wood. Hopefully it won't happen for a while.""Although Ulrich respects how veteran musicians such as Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen and The Rolling Stones are still out on the road, he understands that none of these artists are required to play songs as physically demanding as those on Metallica's set-lists.""Springsteen plays three-hour shows and just played 28 fucking songs on the opening night,"" Ulrich enthuses. ""He looks healthier and stronger than ever. But I appreciate what you're saying. None of them are playing Battery.""Revealing how long he believes Metallica have left before they retire from the stage, he concludes: ""I would say if we stay healthy, hopefully we've got another decade. I mean, the second I'm done with you, I'm getting on the Peloton.""";2023-04-07;https://www.loudersound.com/news/lars-ulrich-thinks-metallica-have-about-ten-years-as-a-touring-band-left-before-they-get-too-old;2023-04-09;9999-12-31;1;LOUDERLARSULRICHTHINKSMETALLICAHAVEABOUTTENYEARSLEFTASATOURINGBAND
